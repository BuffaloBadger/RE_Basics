# Kinetics Data Analysis

The first section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* introduced the field of reaction engineering and reviewed basic facts about chemical reactions. The second section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* examined chemical reaction rates and rate expressions. That was followed by a short, third section wherein reactor response models were defined. Their mathematical structure was examined and five types of problems that require reactor response models for their solution were identified. 

The second section noted that rate expressions for a reaction contain kinetics parameters that in general are unknown and specific to that reaction. The third section mentioned that parameter estimation problems are one type of problem that requires the use of a reactor response model. This fourth section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* examines the generation of kinetics data and the use of those data, together with reactor response models, to estimate the kinetics parameters and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression.
