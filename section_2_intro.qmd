# Rate Expressions {#sec-part_2_overview}

The first part of *Reaction Engineering Basics* included an introduction to the field of reaction engineering and its safe and ethical practice. It also defined chemical reactions and reviewed thermodynamic concepts associated with them. Different ways of describing how far a reaction has progressed were reviewed. This second part of *Reaction Engineering Basics* considers how quickly reactions progress. In addition to defining reaction rates, this part examines mathematical models for reaction rates. Such models are called rate expressions, and they describe how the reaction rate varies with temperature, pressure and composition.
