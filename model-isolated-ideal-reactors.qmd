# Modeling Isolated Ideal Reactors

The first two sections of *Reaction Engineering Basics* introduced the field of reaction engineering, reviewed basic facts about chemical reactions, and described rate expressions. The third section defined and described a kind of reactor model called a reactor response model. Reactor response models are used in all remaining sections of *Reaction Engineering Basics*. The preceeding section considered the use of reactor response models for the purpose of estimating kinetics parameters and assessing the accuracy of rate expressions. 

This fifth section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* describes the use of reactor response models in the analysis of isolated ideal reactors. Specifically it considers problems involving batch stirred tank reactors (BSTRs), semi-batch stirred tank reactors (SBSTRs), continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) and tubular plug flow reactors (PFRs). For each of those ideal reactor types, this section considers the use of reactor response models to (a) calculate reactor response given reactor input or vice versa, (b) optimize reactor response and (c) design reactors.
