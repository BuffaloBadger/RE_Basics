# Modeling Non-Ideal Reactors

This is the final part of *Reaction Engineering Basics*. The first two parts were primarily focused on reactions and reaction rates. The next four parts involved systems that included *ideal reactors*. This seventh part presents an overview of continuous reactor models that can be used when the flow in the reactor does not conform to the assumption of perfect mixing nor to the assumption of plug flow. The models are empirical in nature as each of them contains one or more parameters that must be adjusted so as to provide the most accurate representation of the actual, non-ideal reactor.
