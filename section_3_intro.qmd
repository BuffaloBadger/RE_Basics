# Modeling Ideal Reactors {#sec-3_overview}

The first part of *Reaction Engineering Basics* reviewed chemical reactions and stoichiometry. The second part defined chemical reaction rates and introduced rate expressions as mathematical models that predict the rate of a reaction as a function of fluid composition, temperature and pressure. In addition to models for reaction rates, reaction engineering requires mathematical models for chemical reactors. This third part of *Reaction Engineering Basics* focuses upon idealized models for the four types of chemical reactor that were mentioned in @sec-1_intro_and_defs. @sec-3_design_eqns examines the equations that are needed in order to model the reactors. Those equations are called the reactor design equations. @sec-3_reactor_model_func presents a strategy for creating computer functions that solve the reactor design equations and facilitate reaction engineering analyses.
