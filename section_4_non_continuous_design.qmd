# Design of Non-Continuous Reactors {#sec-4_non_continuous_design}

@sec-4_response_opt_design describes and differentiates between response, optimization, and design tasks or problems. @sec-4_bstr_analysis and @sec-4_sbstr_analysis examine the modeling of two non-continuous, ideal reactors: BSTRs and SBSTRs. They illustrate the use of the reactor design equations to complete reaction engineering assignments involving response and optimization tasks. This chapter introduces design tasks for non-continuous ideal reactors.

Reactor design is an advanced aspect of reaction engineering. This chapter is a very basic introduction to reactor design. Its intent is to make the reader aware that many reaction engineering assignments are open-ended and do not have a single "correct" answer like those considered in Chapters [-@sec-4_bstr_analysis] and [-@sec-4_sbstr_analysis]. Unlike those assignments, reactor design assignments can provide opportunities for a reaction engineer to be very creative and not simply follow some "cookie-cutter" approach to completing assignments. They can lead to discovery of innovative ways to operate reactors and the invention of new kinds of reactors.

## Full Reactive Process Design

principles: safety, regulatory compliance, environmental impact, community impact, profit

economics: capital cost, return on investment, operating costs (labor, utilities, feedstocks, waste disposal, etc.), maintenance, licensing, income (product value)

governmental/legal: siting, permits, licensing

equipment specifications and procurement, piping layout

integration with other components of the process.

operational procedures: start-up, operation, shut-down, process control, turn-around requirements, emergencies

## Preliminary Reactor Design

Participation in a full reactive process design of the kind just described benefits from much deeper knowledge of reaction engineering and much more reaction engineering experience that most readers of this book are likely to possess. Preliminary design involves a more limited scope. [define preliminary design]

Preliminary design starts with an underspecifed reactor process. That is, there isn't enough information about the reactor and its operation to allow analysis. One way to think about or envision preliminary design is as a process wherein the reaction engineer fills in enough missing information to specify a reaction engineering optimization task and then performs that optimization task. The engineer then might fill in the information differently to specify a different reaction engineering optimization task and complete it. This might be repeated any number of times. The results of completing one such optimization task might inspire or inform the specification of a different optimization task. Ultimately, the optimized reactor designs are compared, and the most promising one is selected.

That is the approach adopted in this chapter. More specifically, the focus of this chapter is not on performing calculations it is on the process of starting with an underspecified system and using it to generate reaction enginering optimization tasks. Almost every preliminary design assignment will have unique aspects. The discussion here begins by identifying the things that might be specified in a preliminary design assignment and the things that might be missing. Next some common kinds of constraints are considered. A full economic analysis and optimization is not warranted at the preliminary design stage. In fact it may not be possible, so this section concludes by identifying reactor performance metrics that might be used as economic indicators when comparing different preliminary designs.

### Preliminary Design Specifications

Input specifications: feedstock, steam and cooling availability

Product specifications: production rate, conversion/selectivity, temperature

Process specifications: use an existing reactor

### Preliminary Design Constraints

Constraints: temperatures, compositions (explosiveness, toxicity, etc.)

### Reactor Performance Metrics as Economic Indicators

Economic indicators: reactor volume, energy inputs (hot and cold), product purity, wastes

## Important Design Decisions

continuous or non-continuous

batch or semi-batch

sizing and operation

## Example

The example presented in this chapter is fundamentally different from most of the examples presented in other chapters. they have one answer and there are a limited number of ways to arrive at that answer; design assignments have many, many answers and even more ways of arriving at those answers. much more focus on what the engineer might be thinking and much less on mathematical and computational details.

### Background

Company makes a number of specialty halogenated hydrocarbons, one of the larger-volume products has an undesired side product, store it in a tank then pay for disposal, exploring the idea of processing it on-site to produce acid that can be sold and halogen-free hydrocarbon that could be burned for heat or possibly used in other processes. Several other products also generate halogenated wastes, but in smaller amounts.
