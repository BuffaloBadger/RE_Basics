# Design of Non-Continuous Reactors {#sec-4_non_continuous_design}

@sec-4_response_opt_design describes and differentiates between response, optimization, and design tasks or problems. @sec-4_bstr_analysis and @sec-4_sbstr_analysis examine the modeling of two kinds of non-continuous, ideal reactors: BSTRs and SBSTRs. They illustrate the use of the reactor design equations to complete reaction engineering assignments involving response and optimization tasks. This chapter introduces design tasks for non-continuous ideal reactors.

Reactor design is an advanced aspect of reaction engineering. This chapter is a very basic introduction to reactor design. Its intent is to make the reader aware that many reaction engineering assignments are open-ended and do not have a single "correct" answer like those considered in Chapters [-@sec-4_bstr_analysis] and [-@sec-4_sbstr_analysis]. Unlike those assignments, reactor design assignments can provide opportunities for a reaction engineer to be very creative and not simply follow some "cookie-cutter" approach to completing assignments. They can lead to discovery of innovative ways to operate reactors and the invention of new kinds of reactors.

## Full Reactive Process Design

Chemical reactors are virtually always one part of a larger process. The highest level of design starts with a decision to build a process from scratch. The decision to do this would be informed by some number of preliminary analyses of the market for the products from the process, the economic potential of the process, the technical feasibility of the process, etc. Full reactive process design will involve a team comprising members with expertise in finance, planning, procurement, law, construction, chemistry, engineering, etc. The members with engineering epertise would include a reaction engineer among other engineering specializations including separations, control, heating and cooling, etc.

There are principles that should guide any reactive process design. Among the more important principles, the process should be safe to operate, it should comply with all governmental regulations, it should not have unfavorable or unjust environmental and societal impacts, and it should be profitable.

Some of the economic factors that must be evaluated as part of the process design are the capital costs (one time expenses to purchase the necessary equipment, etc.), the operating costs (including labor, utilities, feedstock costs, waste disposal, etc.), maintenance costs, licensing costs (e. g. royalties for use of patented technology), income the process will generate and the return on investment. Governmental and legal activities include choosing the site for the process, securing necessary permits, licensing any necessary technology, identifying all regulatory restrictions that apply to the process. Engineers and business administration experts work together to develop equipment specification and procure the equipment. The engineering team lays out the piping and designs the individual components, making sure that they are all properly and efficiently integrated. Specific tasks that a reaction engineer would be involved in include selecting the type of reactor(s) to be used, sizing the reactors and specifying operational prameters (heating and cooling, feed temperature and composition), specifying turn-around tasks and timing for non-continuous processes, and developing procedures for start-up, operation, shut-down, and various possible emergencies.

## Preliminary Reactor Design

Participation in a full reactive process design of the kind just described requires much deeper knowledge of reaction engineering and much more reaction engineering experience that most readers of this book are likely to possess. Preliminary design involves a more limited scope. A preliminary reactor design might be one of the factors that go into the decision to build the full process. The goals of a preliminary design can include identifying the kind of reactor and the preferred way to operate it when used in the process under consideration. It can use approximate feed compositions and educated estimates of necessary conversion and selectivity. A detailed economic model is not required, but an awareness of factors that affect both capital and operating costs is important.

Preliminary design starts with an underspecifed reactor process. That is, there isn't enough information about the reactor and its operation to allow analysis. One way to think about or envision preliminary design is as a process wherein the reaction engineer fills in enough missing information to specify a reaction engineering optimization task and then performs that optimization task. The engineer then might fill in the information differently to specify a different reaction engineering optimization task and complete it. This might be repeated any number of times. The results of completing one such optimization task might inspire or inform the specification of a different optimization task. Ultimately, the optimized reactor designs are compared, and the most promising one is selected.

From the reaction engineer's perspective, their starting point is an underspecified reactor. The reaction engineer turns it into a fully specified reactor by choosing the reactor type, setting some of the operating parameters for that reactor type, and optimizing the remaining operating parameters using a reactor model. The reaction engineer may do this for more than one type of reactor, and they may vary which parameters they set and which ones they find by optimizing a reactor model. The different reactor types that the engineer considers and the various combinations of parameters they set versus those they find using modleing can be referred to collectively as the engineer's design strategy. 

Readers who have assimilated the knowledge and skills from Chapters [-@sec-4_bstr_analysis] and [-@sec-4_sbstr_analysis] are capable of non-continuous reactor analysis. This chapter emphasizes design strategy, not analysis. More specifically, the focus is on choosing the reactor type and specifying operational parameters leading to a fully specified reactor that can be analysed. The design strategy may involve doing this repeatedly with the goal of identifying a fully specified reactor system that meets or exceeds the initial design specifications with the largest possible financial profits.

Almost every preliminary design assignment will have unique aspects. The discussion here begins by identifying the things that might be specified in a preliminary design assignment and the things that might be missing. Next some common kinds of constraints are considered. A full economic analysis and optimization is not warranted at the preliminary design stage. In fact it may not be possible, so this section concludes by identifying reactor performance metrics that might be used as economic indicators when comparing different preliminary designs.

### Preliminary Design Specifications

As already mentioned, reactor design tasks begin with an underspecified reactor. The specifications that are provided in the assignment are called design specifications. Arguably, the reactor type (BSTR, SBSTR, CSTR, PFR, etc) has the greatest effect upon how the reactor performs, but in many (most?) cases, the reactor type is **not** one of the design specifications. Common exceptions to this occur when the design calls for the use of an existing reactor, or when many similar processes have already been designed and they all use the same reactor type. Process parameters including operating temperature and pressure, flow rates, reactor volume, heat exchange area and heat transfer coefficient often are not among the design specifications. 

Very commonly the design specifications **do** identify the feedstock to be used and often its purity, as well. Feed temperatures, flow rates, and other details about how the feed is added are often missing. Steam is often available at one or two temperatures/pressures in a chemical plant, and chilled water at a single temperature. Whatever the steam and chilled water availability, the engineer would typically know what is available. In academic design assignments, the temperatures and pressures of available steam and water often is not specified. Sometimes heat can be exchanged with other process streams in a chemical plant, but this information may not be known in a preliminary design. The identity of the desired products is usually known, and sometimes the purity and/or production rate are among the design specifications, too. 

### Preliminary Design Constraints

The engineer may not have complete freedom as they add to the design specifications. Other considerations constrain their freedom. For example, there may be temperature limits on various process streams. These might include a maximum allowed reaction temperature (to prevent undesired reactions, phase changes in the reactor, or catalyst deactivation), a maximum outlet temperature on chilled water, or a maximum final temperature for a batch process (so the reactor can be drained safely). Safety can also impose other constraints such as a maximum temperature that feed and product piping can withstand, composition limits to avoid danger of explosion, etc. If anything is being discharged to the atmosphere or into bodies of water, regulations may restrict composition.

Constraints like those just mentioned often do not apply directly to the specifications that the engineer adds to the design specifications. Instead, they limit the choices the engineer can make indirectly. That is, after the engineer adds to the design specifications so the reactor is no longer underspecified, the reactor must be modeled in order to determine whether any of the constraints are violated.

### Reactor Performance Metrics as Economic Indicators

One of the primary goals of process design is to arrive at a set of process specifications that will result in the greatest rate of financial profit, should the process be built. At the preliminary design stage there are still too many unknowns for that sort of financial analysis. Instead, reactor performance metrics that are related to profit are used to optimize the reactor system. For example, the operating costs often scale with the volume of the reactor. In that case, one of the goals of the preliminary design would be to minimize the reactor volume. Similarly, the use of steam or another medium for heating and the use of chilled water or another coolant have associated costs. Minimizing the amount of heating and cooling that uses an exchange fluid then becomes another design objective. If the temperature of available steam or coolant is not known or specified, using lower steam temperatures and higher coolant temperatures similarly reduces costs. The selling price of the product may depend upon its purity, and production of hazardous wastes can add to operating costs. In both of these cases, selectivity may be an important metric that is related to process profit. Each situation will have key metrics that have a significant impact on process profits. In a preliminary design these metrics can be appropriately minimized or maximized in lieu of an economic analysis.

## Important Design Decisions

A review of the examples in Chapters [-@sec-4_bstr_analysis] and [-@sec-4_sbstr_analysis] will reveal that simply analyzing a reactor requires a relatively shallow level of understanding of reactor performance and a relatively low level of thinking. That is, if one learns how to generate and simplify the reactor design equations for a given system along with some important definitions, modeling the reactor always follows the same general steps. (Write and simplify the design equations, specify the initial and final values, write ancillary equations needed to evaluate the derivatives at the start of an integration step, write ancillary equations to calculate the initial and final values, solve the reactor design equations, write ancillary equations to calculate any other quantities of interest, and calculate the quantities of interest.) When one has that minimum level of knowledge and knows the steps to follow to solve the design equations, response and optimization tasks can be completed without too much additional thought or understanding.

Looking at the discussion that follows many of the examples in Chapters [-@sec-4_bstr_analysis] and [-@sec-4_sbstr_analysis], and particularly at the qualitative analysis, reveals a deeper level of understanding and a higher level of thinking. At that level, physical explanations for observed phenomena are sought and developed. That is, those discussions seek to explain in physical (not mathematical) terms why a graph has a given shape or passes through a minimum or maximum, or why increasing the inlet temperature or inlet flow rate affects the output in the way that it does. It requires deeper knowledge (e. g. what factors can cause temperature or reaction rate to change) and higher level of thinking (e. g. which of those factors are at play or important at a given point in the process; how will the importance of those factors change over the course of processing; how are those factor related to the reactor inputs).

It can be argued that reactor design requires an even deeper level of understanding of reactor performance and an eveh higher level of thinking. During reactor design the reaction engineer isn't trying to explain an observed reactor response. Rather, the engineer needs to predict how to cause a desired reactor response by altering what goes into the reactor and how it is operated. When a reaction engineer lacks an appropriate level of understanding or has not learned to think at an appropriate level, their design strategy can devolve to the point of trial and error which is at best inefficient and at worst, ineffective.

Having acquired sufficient understanding and thinking at an appropriate level, there are a few key design decisions the reaction engineer needs to make during a preliminary design. One of the first is whether the process should be continuouis or non-continuous. This was discussed in Chapters [-@sec-4_bstr_analysis] and [-@sec-4_sbstr_analysis]. For present purposes it is assumed that the priliminary design involves a non-continuous process.

Having settled on a non-continuous process, the next key decision is whether to use a BSTR or an SBSTR. @sec-4_sbstr_analysis identified three situations where and SBSTR can offer a clear advantage over a BSTR: highly exothermic reactions, reactions where the selectivity is strongly affected by the relative amounts of the reactants, and reversible reactions where a product can be selectivity removed. If one of these situations clearly pertains, the choice between BSTR and SBSTR is clear.

In many cases the choice wont be clear. For example the engineer may not know whether the reaction rate so fast and the exothermicity so great that temperature could not be controlled in a BSTR. In this situation the engineer might initially select a BSTR and begin the design process. If the rate or extent of temperature rise is always unaccepably large, the use of a BSTR can be abandoned, and replaced with design of an SBSTR. If the engineer initially selects an SBSTR and successfully completes a preliminary design for it, they won't know whether a BSTR might perform even better.

## Example

Design requires deeper thinking than performing reactor analysis - perhaps comparable to interpreting results of analysis.

The example presented in this chapter is fundamentally different from most of the examples presented in other chapters. they have one answer and there are a limited number of ways to arrive at that answer; design assignments have many, many answers and even more ways of arriving at those answers. much more focus on what the engineer might be thinking and much less on mathematical and computational details.

### Background

Company makes a number of specialty halogenated hydrocarbons, one of the larger-volume products has an undesired side product, store it in a tank then pay for disposal, exploring the idea of processing it on-site to produce acid that can be sold and halogen-free hydrocarbon that could be burned for heat or possibly used in other processes. Several other products also generate halogenated wastes, but in smaller amounts.
