# Design of Non-Continuous Reactors {#sec-4_non_continuous_design}

This chapter will be added as soon as I finish writing it.

## BSTR Design Objectives

As noted in @sec-4_response_opt_design, design assignments typically do not fully specify the reactor system or its operation. They require the engineer find a set of system and process specifications that optimize some financial objective such as maximizing the rate of profit. That can entail calculation of fixed and operating costs, etc. together with reactor modeling. These types of design problems are beyond the scope of *Reaction Engineering Basics*. However, for illustrative purposes, reactor and process parameters can be used as indicators of these costs. For an isolated BSTR a few of the reactor and process parameters that might be used as economic indicators include the system volume (smaller is better), the processing time (shorter is better), the net production rate, @eq-bstr_net_rate, (larger is better), heat requirements (smaller is better), and selectivity or yield of one of the products. These indicators can be minimized or maximized using other reactor and process parameters including initial composition, temperature, reaction time, etc. Design assignments involving BSTRs are considered in @sec-4_non_continuous_design.
