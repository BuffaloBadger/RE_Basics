# SBSTR Analysis {#sec-4_sbstr_analysis}

- see section 1.2 and chapter 6
- description/comparison to other reactor types; typical uses; advantages and disadvantages

## SBSTR Operation

- similar to BSTR, key differences
- transition to BSTR

## SBSTR Design Equations

- mole, energy, exhange fluid (sens), exchange fluid(latent)
- alternative terms for sensible heat
- common ancillary equations

## General Approach

- identification from chapter 12
- design equations will be a set of IVODEs
- response function is used in same ways as for BSTR, wont repeat details

## SBSTR Design Objectives

## Examples

### Response of an SBSTR for a Hydrolysis Reaction

## Note

This problem is loosely based upon the work of Haldar and Rao [-@haldar_experimental_1992; -@haldar_experimental_1992-1], but the rate expression was modified and additional assumptions regarding fluid and reactor properties were introduced. This was done to avoid intricate details from obscuring the basic approach to the analysis of a semi-batch reactor. Therefore, the results presented here should not be used for engineering purposes, but rather the original work should be consulted.
