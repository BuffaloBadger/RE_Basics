# Modeling Non-Ideal Reactors

This is the final section of *Reaction Engineering Basics*. The first two sections were primarily focused on reactions and reaction rates. The next four sections involved systems that included *ideal reactors*. This seventh section presents an overview of models that can be used when the reactor does not conform to the assumptions of one of the ideal reactor types.
