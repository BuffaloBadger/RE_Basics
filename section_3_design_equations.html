<p>Reactor models are essential for reaction engineering analyses, including the analysis of kinetics data for the purpose of validating a proposed rate expression. A reactor model is a set of equations that relates what goes into a reactor to what comes out. Other parameters that affect the relationship between what goes in and what come out appear within the model. In most cases the model equations cannot be solved analytically, making numerical solution necessary. For this reason, <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> assumes that the reactor model equations will always be solved numerically. This chapter describes and discusses the variables needed to model a reactor, the equations that constitute a reactor model, and some aspects of the numerical solution of those equations.</p>
<section id="a-generic-reactor" class="level2" data-number="6.1">
<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-generic-reactor"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> A Generic Reactor</h2>
<p>The four types of ideal reactors used in <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em>, batch stirred-tank reactors (BSTRs), semi-batch stirred-tank reactors (SBSTRs), continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs), were briefly introduced in <a href="section_1_intro_and_defs.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;1</span></a>. Schematic diagrams of stirred tanks, <a href="section_1_intro_and_defs.html#fig-closed_stirred_tank_reactor">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.3</span></a>, and tubular reactors, <a href="section_1_intro_and_defs.html#fig-pfr">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.4</span></a>, were also presented. Each of these will be discussed in detail later in this chapter. To begin, however, a generic reactor (one that could be any one of those four ideal reactor types) is considered. Doing so helps identify the different kinds of variables needed to model a reactor as well as the equations that are used to describe the relationships between those variables.</p>
<section id="variables-used-when-modeling-a-reactor" class="level3" data-number="6.1.1">
<h3 data-number="6.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="variables-used-when-modeling-a-reactor"><span class="header-section-number">6.1.1</span> Variables Used When Modeling a Reactor</h3>
<p>Briefly, every ideal reactor has a compartment that contains reacting fluid. If the reacting fluid needs to be heated or cooled, they <em>may</em> have a second compartment, as described in <a href="apndx_heat_exchange.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>D</span></a>. Depending on the specific physical structure of the reactor, the second compartment is sometimes referred to as the reactor shell or jacket. If the reactor has a shell, an “exchange fluid” will be flowing through it. It is called the exchange fluid because its purpose is to exchange heat with the reacting fluid. The exchange fluid is physically separated from the reacting fluid by a solid wall that prevents the two fluids from mixing. Heat is transferred through the wall separating the two reactor compartments.</p>
<p>Note that the word “reactor” sometimes refers to the entire piece of equipment including both the compartment containing the reacting fluid and the shell. Other times “reactor” refers only to the compartment containing the reacting fluid. This is not likely to cause confusion; the meaning is usually clear from the context of the statement. The physico-chemical properties of the reacting fluid and the exchange fluid, that is their densities, heat capacities, etc., are needed when modeling a reactor. Consequently, <strong>fluid properties</strong> are one of the groups of variables that appear in the equations used to model a reactor.</p>
<p>Reactor input and reactor output were defined above as what goes into the reactor and what comes out of the reactor. These definitions work fine for the continuous reactors (CSTRs and PFRs) because they have fluid flowing into and out of them as they operate. It also works for the exchange fluid, if present, because it, too, is flowing into and out of the reactor as the reactor operates. However, for BSTRs and SBSTRs the meaning of reactor input and reactor output requires additional refinement. For BSTRs the reactor input refers to what is present within the reaction compartment just before the reactions begin, and BSTR output refers to what is present within the reaction compartment right after the reactions end. The same meanings for input and output apply to SBSTRs, but SBSTR input additionally includes what flows into the reaction compartment while the reactions are taking place. <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> does not consider SBSTRs where reacting fluid flow out of the reactor.</p>
<p>The <strong>reactor input variables</strong> include the input molar amount (or molar flow rate) of every reagent, the input temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, the mass flow rate of the exchange fluid, and the inlet temperature of the exchange fluid. As used here, “reagent” includes <em>every</em> chemical species that is present at any time within the system. That includes “inert” chemical species that are neither a reactant nor a product in any of the reactions occurring in the system.</p>
<p>The output molar amount (or molar flow rates) of every reagent, output temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, and the rate at which work is done by the reacting system on its surroundings make up the <strong>reactor output variables</strong>. There are two differences when compared to the reactor input variables. First, <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> assumes there is never accumulation of exchange fluid within the reactor. Consequently the outlet mass flow rate of the exchange fluid is always equal to its inlet mass flow rate. Since the exchange fluid mass flow rate is included among the reactor input variables, it is <em>not</em> included among the reactor output variables.</p>
<p>The other difference is work done by the reacting system on its surroundings. If the reactor has a moving boundary, such as a pistion, it is possible for the reactor to perform mechanical work on its surroundings. That work is included among the reactor output variables. This is important, for example, if the combustion chamber in an automobile engine is modeled as a chemical reactor. The reactors considered in <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> are typically vessels located in a chemical processing facility or laboratory. The only moving boundaries associated with those reactors is usually a shaft connected to an agitator that is used to mix the reagents. In all cases in <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em>, the work associated with agitation of the fluid in a stirred tank is considered to be negligible.</p>
<p><strong>Reactor parameters</strong> appear in the reactor model equations. They include the dimensions of the reactor (volume for stirred tanks or diameter and length for PFRs), the shell volume, the heat transfer area, the heat transfer coefficient, and some measure of the reaction time. If there is a packed bed of catalyst particles in the reactor, the bed porosity is also included with these parameters.</p>
<p>The reaction time can be characterized in different ways. For closed systems (BSTRs and SBSTRs) the reaction time variable is measured using clock time. It is the difference between the clock time when the reaction started and the clock time when it ended. It is customary to define an elapsed time, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, as being equal to zero when the reaction starts, in which case the reaction time is equal to the elapsed time when the reaction stops.</p>
<p>In an open system (CSTRs and PFRs), reaction starts when the fliud enters the reactor and it ends when the fluid leaves the reactor. The reaction time then is equal to the amount of time the fluid spends in the reactor. On average, a fluid flowing into a reactor of volume, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, at a volumetric flow rate of <span class="math inline">\(\dot V_{in}\)</span>, is within the reactor for an amount of time, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, given by <a href="#eq-space_time">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a>. In reaction engineering, <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is given a special name; it is called the <strong>space time</strong>. The reciprocal of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is called the <strong>space velocity</strong>. For open systems the space time can be used as a measure of the reaction time.</p>
<p><span id="eq-space_time"><span class="math display">\[
\tau = \frac{V}{\dot V_{in}}
\tag{6.1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The elapsed time and the space time are explicit specifications of the reaction time. In some cases, the reaction time may be specified implicitly. For example, when a problem specifies the final amount of a reagent, that is an implicit specification of the reaction time. It means that the reaction proceeded for the length of time necessary for the amount of that reagent to change from its initial value to the specified final value.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>reaction properties</strong> include kinetics parameters and heats of reaction that appear in models of chemical reactors. Both fluid properties and reaction properties may vary as a function of temperature, pressure or composition. In those cases, equations for calculating the property must be available, and any constants that appear in those equations are included among the reaction and fluid properties <a href="#tbl-reactor_variables">Table&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a> summarizes the variable groups that are used when modeling an ideal reactor.</p>

<p>The groups of variables that are needed to describe an ideal reactor were identified above. The purpose of an ideal reactor model is to relate the reactor outputs to the reactor inputs. <strong>Mole balances</strong> relate the input molar amounts to the output molar amounts, so they are <em>always</em> included in a reactor model. A mole balance can be written for each reagent in the system, whether or not it is present in the reactor input. That includes reagents that are reactants or products in the reactions that are occurring <em>as well as</em> reagents that are neither reactants nor products in any of the reactions. The reagents that do not participate in any of the reactions can be referred to as “inerts.”</p>
<p><strong>Energy balances</strong> on the reacting fluid and on the exchange fluid relate their output temperatures to the input variables. An energy balance on the reacting fluid also relates the rate at which the reactor performs work to the input variables. The reacting fluid and exchange fluid energy balances also are normally included in the reactor model equations. As discussed below, there are circumstances where a reactor can be modeled without using one or both of the energy balances.</p>
<p>A <strong>momentum balance</strong> must sometimes be included in a reactor model for a PFR. When it is included, the momentum balance relates the outlet pressure of the reacting fluid to the reactor inputs. Momentum balances are not needed with any of the stirred tank reactors. The momentum balance accounts for the conversion of kinetic energy associated with the flow of the reacting fluid to thermal energy. While this energy is negligible with respect to the energy balance, it can have a significant effect upon the pressure of the reacting fluid as it flows through a PFR. For the stirred tank reactors, and for a PFR where the momentum balance is not needed, the outlet pressure can be calculated from the other <em>output</em> variables using the equation of state (i. e. using the ideal gas law or assuming liquids to have constant density).</p>
<p>Collectively, the mole balances, energy balances, and momentum balance (when needed) are commonly referred to as the <strong>design equations</strong> for the reactor. The words <strong>“transient” and “steady state”</strong> are used to differentiate two modes of reactor operation. When a reactor operates at steady state, one can watch any one point in the reactor and the conditions (temperature, pressure, composition, flow rate, etc.) will not change over time. At a different point in the reactor, the conditions may be different, but they, too, will be constant over time. Putting it another way, when a reactor operates at steady state, the conditions may vary spatially, but they won’t vary temporally (i. e. over time). In a transient reactor one will observe changes in the conditions over time when watching any one point within the reactor. That is, within a transient reactor the conditions <em>will</em> vary temporally (and possibly spatially, too). Note that BSTRs and SBSTR are always transient while CSTR and PFR operating modes can be either steady state or transient. The most general form of the design equations are those for transient operation. As described in subsequent sections, the design equations for steady-state operation represent a simplification of the transient design equations.</p>
<p>In addition to the reactor design equations <strong>rate expressions for every reaction</strong> taking place it the system are <em>always</em> needed when modeling a reactor. Assuming Arrhenius temperature dependence, the associated pre-exponential factors and activation energies, along with any other parameters appearing in the rate epxressions are included among the reaction properties in <a href="#tbl-reactor_variables">Table&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a>. As noted above, physico-chemical properties that appear in the design equations may be functions of temperature, pressure, and/or composition. If so, equations for calculating them are needed, and any parameters appearing in them is included among the fluid properties in <a href="#tbl-reactor_variables">Table&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a>.</p>

<p>It is not <em>always</em> necessary to use all of the reactor modeling equations listed in <a href="#tbl-reactor_equations">Table&nbsp;<span>6.2</span></a>. For example, mole balances do not need to be written for <em>every</em> reagent in the system because the amounts of the reactants and products in the reactions are related through stoichiometry. The amount of an inert reagent is not related to the amount of any other reagent through stoichiometry. If <span class="math inline">\(N_{ind}\)</span> is the number of mathematically independent reactions taking place in the system, then <span class="math inline">\(N_{ind}\)</span> mole balances are needed to relate the input amounts of reactants and products to the output amounts. Consequently, the <strong>minimum number of mole balances</strong> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(N_{ind}\)</span> plus one mole balance for each inert reagent. <a href="#sec-example_6_1">Example&nbsp;<span>6.9.1</span></a> illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations using the minimum number of mole balances.</p>
<p>Liquid-phase systems often consist of a solvent that contains the reagents as solutes. In systems of this type, sensible heat terms are usually written in terms of the mass-specific or volume-specific heat capacity of the entire reacting fluid. Generally, <strong>a mole balance on the liquid-phase solvent is not needed</strong> for such systems. If, for some reason, the sensible heat terms are written in terms of molar heat capacities of the individual reagents, then the solvent must be included among those reagents and a mole balance on the solvent would need to be included among the reactor design equations. <a href="#sec-example_6_4">Example&nbsp;<span>6.9.4</span></a> illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for a system involving a liquid-phase solution.</p>
<p><strong>A momentum balance is only needed when the reactor is a PFR</strong>. Even then, some PFR problems indicate that pressure drop is negligible, in which case the momentum balance is not needed.</p>
<p><strong>If a reactor operates adiabatically</strong> there will not be an exchange fluid, and consequently an energy balance on the exchange fluid cannot be included among the design equations. <a href="#sec-example_6_2">Example&nbsp;<span>6.9.2</span></a> illustrates the formulation of a reactor model for an adiabatic reactor. For historical reasons it is worth noting that for adiabatic systems, the energy balance on the reacting fluid can be <em>replaced</em> by an equation for the adiabatic temperature (see <a href="apndx_reaction_thermo.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>C</span></a> and particularly <a href="apndx_reaction_thermo.html#eq-adiabatic_temperature">Equation&nbsp;<span>C.4</span></a>). Before computers became commonplace, doing this sometimes made it easier to solve the design equations analytically. It isn’t as important now that powerful personal computers that can solve multiple ODEs are ubiquitous.</p>
<p><strong>If a reactor operates isothermally</strong>, the mole balance equations and the energy balance equations are not coupled. The mole balance equations can be solved separately from the two energy balance equations. True isothermal operation of an industrial reactor is not very common, but laboratory reactors that are used to generate kinetics data normally operate isothermally. The energy balances may needed when modeling isothermal reactors, but if the reacting fluid temperature is known, <em>the mole balances can be solved separately from the energy balances</em>, and <em>vice versa</em>. <a href="#sec-example_6_1">Example&nbsp;<span>6.9.1</span></a> illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for an isothermal reactor.</p>
<p><strong>If the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid is known and constant</strong>, the other reactor design equations can be solved independently from the energy balance on the exchange fluid. There are two situations where this can happen. The first is when the exchange fluid exchange undergoes a phase change and exchanges the associated latent heat. Phase changes occur at constant temperature, so, for example, if condensation of saturated steam at 1 atm is being used to supply heat to the reacting fluid, the temperature of the exchange fluid will be constant and equal to 100 °C. Knowing this, all the other reactor design equations can be solved separately from the energy balance on the exchange fluid. (Note that this is only true because <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> always assumes that the exchange fluid undergoes either a phase change or a temperature change, but <em>not both</em>.) In this case, the energy balance on the exchange fluid can be solved separately, for example, to calculate the minimum exchange fluid flow rate needed to provide the required amount of energy to the reacting fluid. <a href="#sec-example_6_4">Example&nbsp;<span>6.9.4</span></a> illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for a system where the exchange fluid phase changes.</p>
<p>The other situation where all the other reactor design equations can be solved separately from the energy balance on the exchange fluid occurs in problems for reaction engineering courses. It is not uncommon for a problem to provide only the temperature of the exchange fluid, but not its flow rate or its inlet temperature. In this case the other design equations can be solved independently from the energy balance on the exchange fluid, while the energy balance on the exchange fluid cannot be used because the problem does not provide sufficient information to use it.</p>

<p>An energy balance on the exchange fluid is one of the design equations for every one of the non-adiabatic ideal reactors, so it is considered first here. <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> assumes that the exchange fluid continually flows through the shell/jacket, and that within the shell/jacket, it is perfectly mixed. The exchange fluid is further assumed to be a pure fluid that either undergoes phase change or temperature change, but not both. The associated latent or sensible heat is transferred to or from the reacting fluid through a common wall that separates them.</p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="apndx_heat_exchange.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>D</span></a>, there are two forms of the energy balance on the exchange fluid: one is used when the temperature of exchange fluid changes, and the other is used when the exchange fluid changes phase.

<p>From the perspective of the reacting fluid, a BSTR is a closed system. Reacting fluid neither enters nor leaves the reactor while it is operating. This is apparent in the schematic BSTR diagram, <a href="#fig-bstr_ch6_schematic">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a>. The reacting fluid is shown in blue in that figure, with no reacting fluid entering or leaving. If the reactor has a one, the shell/jacket is an <em>open</em> system; heat exchange fluid continually flows through it. <a href="#fig-bstr_ch6_schematic">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a> depicts a BSTR with a shell/jacket; the exchange fluid within it is shown in yellow. The two agitators in the figure are reminders that the reacting fluid within the reaction compartment and the exchange fluid within the shell are each perfectly mixed. An <em>adiabatic</em> BSTR would not have a shell/jacket.</p>

<p>The most <strong>important assumptions when modeling an ideal BSTR</strong> are (i) the reaction zone is a closed system, (ii) within the reactor, the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iii) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, (iv) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture and (v) the reacting fluid does not undergo a phase change while the reactor is operating. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in <a href="apndx_ideal_reactor_models.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>G</span></a>. Examples <a href="#sec-example_6_1"><span>6.9.1</span></a> and <a href="#sec-example_6_2"><span>6.9.2</span></a> illustrate writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for BSTRs.</p>
<p>The <strong>mole balance</strong> on any one reagent, <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, in an ideal BSTR is presented in <a href="#eq-bstr_mole_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.8</span></a>. It has only two terms: the term on the left side of the equation represents the rate of accumulation of reagent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and the term on the right side represents its net rate of generation. The summation in the generation term includes <em>all</em> reactions occurring in the system.</p>
<p><span id="eq-bstr_mole_balance"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
\tag{6.8}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The <strong>energy balance</strong> on the reacting fluid within an ideal BSTR is presented in <a href="#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a>. The summation on the left side of the equation includes <em>all</em> reagents present in the system, <em>not just</em> reactants and products of the reactions. Similarly, the summation of the right side of the equation includes <em>all</em> reactions taking place in the system.</p>
<p><span id="eq-bstr_energy_balance"><span class="math display">\[
\left(\sum_i n_i \hat C_{p,i} \right) \frac{dT}{dt} - V\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \frac{dV}{dt}  = \dot Q - \dot W - V \sum_j \left(r_j \Delta H_j \right)
\tag{6.9}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The first term on the left side of <a href="#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a> represents the rate of accumulation of energy in the form of <strong>sensible heat</strong>. It is written in terms of the molar heat capacities of <em>all</em> of the reagents present in the system. That is probably the most common form of this term for a gas-phase reacting fluid. For liquid-phase reacting fluids, the sensible heat accumulation term is often expressed in terms of the mass-specific heat capacity of the fluid as a whole or the volume-specific heat capacity of the entire fluid. <a href="#eq-bstr_equivalent_sens_heat_terms">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.10</span></a> shows the three equivalent ways of writing the sensible heat accumulation term.</p>

<p>The second and third terms on the left side of <a href="#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a> represent accumulation of energy associated with expansion or contraction of the reacting fluid. On the right side of the equation, <span class="math inline">\(\dot Q\)</span> represents the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid. This term is the rate at which heat passes from the yellow exchange fluid in <a href="#fig-bstr_ch6_schematic">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a> through the red internal wall and into the blue reacting fluid. If the exchange fluid is being used to heat the reacting fluid, <span class="math inline">\(\dot Q\)</span> is positive; if the exchange fluid is being used to cool the reacting fluid, <span class="math inline">\(\dot Q\)</span> is negative.</p>
<p>In <a href="#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a>, <span class="math inline">\(\dot W\)</span> represents the rate at which the reacting fluid is doing mechanical work on the surroundings. In most cases, the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is work of the agitator as it mixes the reacting fluid. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(\dot W\)</span> is the agitator power delivered to the reacting fluid, and since it is added to the reacting fluid, <span class="math inline">\(\dot W\)</span> is negative. If the reacting fluid is able to expand and cause movement of a reactor wall, for example if it caused a piston to move, <span class="math inline">\(\dot W\)</span> would be positive and equal to the work needed to move the piston.</p>
<p>The final term in <a href="#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a> represents the energy associated with the reactions taking place within the reactor, i. e. the heats of reaction. As previously noted, the summation in this term includes <em>all</em> reactions taking place in the system.</p>
<p>The design equations for a BSTR are initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). In order to solve them, the number of dependent variables must equal the number of IVODEs. The <strong>differential form of the ideal gas law</strong> presented in <a href="#eq-differential_ideal_gas_law">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.11</span></a> is used when the number of dependent variables exceeds the number of IVODEs.</p>

<p>Typically, <strong>the walls of a BSTR are rigid</strong>. For gas-phase reacting fluids, when the reactor walls are rigid, the gas will always occupy the entire reactor volume and that volume will be constant. For liquid-phase reacting fluids, the reactor volume may not be completely full. If there is space above the top surface of the liquid, it is called <em>headspace</em>. In this situation, the volume appearing in the mole and energy balances is the volume of the liquid; it does not include the headspace. However, in <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> liquids are always assumed to be incompressible, ideal mixtures. Consequently, the volume is always constant for a liquid-phase reacting fluid, too. Thus, when the walls are rigid, the volume is constant for both gas-phase and liquid phase reacting fluids. In this case, the time derivative of the volume in the energy balance and in the differential form of the ideal gas law is equal to zero, <a href="#eq-bstr_const_volume">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.12</span></a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-bstr_const_volume"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 0
\tag{6.12}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In all of the stirred tank models, the pressure change due to hydrostatic head is assumed to be negligible. That is, at all depths below the liquid surface the pressure is assumed to be the same. Because <strong>liquid-phase reacting fluids</strong> are assumed to be incompressible ideal mixtures, the pressure will be constant as the temperature and composition change. Since the pressure is constant, its time derivative will equal zero, equation <a href="#eq-bstr_liq_const_pressure">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.13</span></a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-bstr_liq_const_pressure"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0
\tag{6.13}\]</span></span></p>
<p>As already noted, it is often true that <strong>the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator</strong>. When compared to the magnitude of all of the other terms in the energy balance, this term is virtually always negligible, <a href="#eq-bstr_work_negligible">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.14</span></a>. As an example, consider stirring a room temperature glass of water as vigourously as one is able to try to raise its temperature. One could stir as hard as possible and the temperature change would be very, very small.</p>
<p><span id="eq-bstr_work_negligible"><span class="math display">\[
\dot W = 0
\tag{6.14}\]</span></span></p>
<p>It has already been noted that <strong>if the reactor operates adiabatically</strong>, there will not be an exchange fluid in the reactor. By definition, the rate of heat input is equal to zero for an adiabatic process, <a href="#eq-bstr_adiabatic">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.15</span></a>.</p>

<p>As previously noted, the design equations for a BSTR are initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). In order to solve a set of IVODEs, every quantity appearing in the IVODEs must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. The independent variable in the BSTR balance equations is time. Depending upon the specific reactor system, the dependent variables may include the molar amounts of the reagents, the temperature of the reacting fluid, the pressure of the reacting fluid, and the exchange fluid temperature.</p>
<p>When rate expressions are substituted into the mole and energy balances, they will introduce concentrations or partial pressures (for gases), of some reagents. Those <strong>concentrations or partial pressures</strong> must be expressed in terms of the dependent variables in the IVODEs. This is accomplished using the defining equations for concentration and partial pressure, <a href="#eq-bstr_concentration">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.16</span></a> and <a href="#eq-bstr_partial_pressure">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.17</span></a>.</p>

<p>The only difference between an ideal BSTR and an ideal SBSTR is that fluid flows into <em>or</em> out of an ideal SBSTR. A very common situation where fluid flows in, is one where the reaction is higly exothermic, such as when neutralizing a strong acid using a strong base. If a BSTR was used, i. e. if all of the reactants were added at once, it would not be possible to control the temperature due to the very high initial rate of reaction and concommitant release of heat. By using an SBSTR where one of the reactants flows into the reactor, the temperature can be controlled by controlling the rate at which that reactant is added. This mode of SBSTR operation is sometimes called batch-fed or fed-batch operation. It is illustrated schematically in <a href="#fig-sbstr_ch6_schematic">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.2</span></a>. This is the only SBSTR operational mode that is considered in <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em>. The other mode is one where no fluid enters the reactor, but fluid flows out. Most commonly this is done by operating at the boiling point of the reacting liquid, resulting in a two-phase system where the vaporized reagents flow out of the reactor. The presence of two phases in the reactor introduces additional complications that are typically considered in more advanced reaction engineering textbooks.</p>

<p>The <strong>most important assumptions when modeling an ideal SBSTR</strong> are (i) fluid flows into the reactor, but not out, (ii) the fluid does not change phase upon entering the reactor or within it (iii) within the reactor the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iv) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, and (v) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in <a href="apndx_ideal_reactor_models.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>G</span></a>. <a href="#sec-example_6_3">Example&nbsp;<span>6.9.3</span></a> illustrates writing, simplifying and solving the reactor design equations for an ideal SBSTR.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the mole and energy balances for an SBSTR are similar to those for a BSTR, but with additional terms associated with the fluid stream flowing into the reactor. The <strong>ideal SBSTR mole balance</strong> is shown in <a href="#eq-sbstr_mol_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.19</span></a>. The first and last terms are the same as in the BSTR mole balance. The added term represents the molar flow rate of reagent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> into the reactor.</p>

<p>Similarly, <strong>the ideal SBSTR energy balance</strong>, shown in <a href="#eq-sbstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.20</span></a>, has one additional term that is not found in the BSTR energy balance. The added term is the third term on the right side of <a href="#eq-sbstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.20</span></a>. It represents the heat required to raise or lower the entering fluid from its feed temperature to the temperature of the reacting fluid. Due to the assumption of perfect mixing, this temperature change occurs instantaneously as the fluid enters the reactor.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that for each of the ideal reactor types, the mole and energy balances are written for the reacting fluid volume, not the physical volume of the reactor. Gas-phase reacting fluids expand to fill the physical volume of the reactor, so <strong>assuming the reactor walls are rigid</strong>, the reacting fluid volume will be constant and the time derivative of the reacting fluid volume will equal zero, <a href="#eq-bstr_const_volume">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.12</span></a>. However, for a liquid, the volume of the reacting fluid will increase as the feed enters the reactor. In other words, as liquid enters the SBSTR, the reacting fluid volume will increase and the headspace will decrease. If the reacting liquid is assumed to be an incompressible ideal mixture, and the feed flows in at a constant rate, the reacting fluid volume will then be given by <a href="#eq-sbstr_volume">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.22</span></a>. The time derivative of the reacting fluid volume shown in equation <a href="#eq-sbstr_expansion_term">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.23</span></a> applies even if the inlet feed rate is variable as long as the liquid is an incompressible ideal mixture.</p>

<p>Many of the simplifications used for BSTRs are also used for SBSTRs.

<p>An ideal CSTR is similar to an ideal BSTR and an ideal SBSTR, with the primary difference being that fluid continuously flows in <em>and</em> out of a CSTR. This is represented schematically in <a href="#fig-cstr_ch6_schematic">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.3</span></a>. Notice that because the reacting fluid within the reactor is perfectly mixed, the outlet temperature equals the temperature of the reacting fluid within the reactor. Similarly, the figure shows that the concentrations of the reagents leaving the reactor are the same as they are within the reactor. When writing the ideal CSTR mole and energy balance equations, the “out” is omitted from the subscript to simplify the notation. (The “in” is retained for the feed stream, however, to differentiate it from the outlet stream.)</p>

<p>The <strong>most important assumptions of the ideal CSTR model</strong> are (i) the reactor is an open system with fluid continually flowing in <em>and</em> out, (ii) within the reactor the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iii) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, (iv) no phase changes occur upon entering or within the reactor, and (v) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in <a href="apndx_ideal_reactor_models.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>G</span></a>. <a href="#sec-example_6_4">Example&nbsp;<span>6.9.4</span></a> illustrates writing, simplifying and solving the reactor design equations for an ideal CSTR.</p>
<p>A <strong>mole balance</strong> on reagent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in a CSTR is presented in <a href="#eq-cstr_mol_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.24</span></a>. In contrast to the BSTR and SBSTR balances, the CSTR mole and energy balances are written in terms of the molar flow rates of the reagents, <span class="math inline">\(\dot n_i\)</span>, not the molar amounts, <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span>. The three terms on the left side of <a href="#eq-cstr_mol_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.24</span></a> represent the accumulation of reagent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the reacting fluid. The first term is accumulation due to a changing outlet molar flow rate of reagent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. The second term represents accumulation due to the volume of the reacting fluid changing and the third represents accumulation due to changes in the outlet volumetric flow rate. The first term on the right side of the equation is clearly the molar flow rate of reagent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> into the reactor and the second term on the right side is its molar flow out of the reactor.

\tag{6.24}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The <strong>energy balance</strong> on the reacting fluid within an ideal CSTR is presented in <a href="#eq-cstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.25</span></a>. The terms in that equation have a one-to-one correspondence with the terms in the SBSTR energy balance, <a href="#eq-sbstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.20</span></a>, representing sensible heat accumulation, two components of the accumulation of energy associated with mechanical work done by the reacting fluid, the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid, the rate at which the reacting fluid does work on the surroundings, the heat required to raise or lower the entering fluid from its feed temperature to the temperature of the reacting fluid, and the energy associated with the reactions taking place within the reactor, respectively.

<p>As discussed below, both the volume and the pressure are constant in a gas-phase CSTR. For that reason, a differential form of the ideal gas law is not needed for CSTRs.</p>

<p>When the CSTR <strong>walls are rigid</strong> a gas-phase reacting fluid will always occupy the complete physical volume of the reactor. That means that the volume in the mole and energy balances will be constant and the time-derivative of the volume will equal zero, <a href="#eq-bstr_const_volume">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.12</span></a>. Very often this is also true for a liquid-phase reacting fluid. However it is possible for the reacting fluid volume to increase or decrease, along with an equal but opposite change in the headspace. When the liquid is assumed to be an incompressibe, ideal mixture, this only happens if the inlet and outlet volumetric flow rates are not equal.</p>
<p>Ideal CSTRs are almost always assumed to <strong>operate at constant pressure</strong>. As a consequence, the time derivative of the pressure is then equal to zero, <a href="#eq-bstr_liq_const_pressure">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.13</span></a>. Unlike BSTRs and SBSTRs where this was only true for liquid-phase reacting fluids, for CSTRs this is true for <em>both</em> liquid-phase and gas-phase reacting fluids.</p>
<p>As was true for the other stirred tank reactors, when <strong>the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator</strong>, the rate of work being done by the fluid may be assumed to be negligible, <a href="#eq-bstr_work_negligible">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.14</span></a>. As for all reactors, <strong>if the reactor operates adiabatically</strong>, the rate of heat input is zero, <a href="#eq-bstr_adiabatic">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.15</span></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, continuous reactors like CSTRs can operate at steady state. In fact CSTRs are usually designed to operate at steady state. When a CSTR operates at steady state, <em>all</em> of the time derivatives are equal to zero. Steady-state operation is considered separately, below.</p>

<p>When rate expressions are substituted into the CSTR design equations, they introduce <strong>concentrations or partial pressures</strong>. Before the design equations can be solved, the concentrations or partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the independent and dependent variables. This can be done using their defining equations for open systems, Equations <a href="#eq-cstr_concentration"><span>6.27</span></a> and <a href="#eq-cstr_partial_pressure"><span>6.28</span></a>. In these equations the molar flow rates and volumetric flow rates are the <em>outlet</em> values. The rate needs to be evaluated at the conditions <em>within</em> the reactor, but because a CSTR is perfectly mixed, the outlet concentration, partial pressure, and temperature are equal to the concentration, partial pressure, and temperature within the reactor.</p>

<p>The ideal PFR is very different from the three ideal stirred tank reactor types. It is not perfectly mixed, but instead the reacting fluid flows steadily from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet. The reactor is assumed to be cylindrical with a constant diameter, and the reacting fluid is assumed to flow only in the axial direction. The velocity of the flow at any fixed axial position is constant across the full diameter of the tubular reactor. This is called plug flow, and is illustrated in <a href="#fig-plug_flow">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.4</span></a>. If the walls of the reactor were transparent and it was possible to color a disk-shaped portion of the fluid as shown in that figure, the colored fluid would look like a solid disk moving from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor.</p>

<p>In addition, the PFR model assumes that at any one axial position, the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial direction. As a consequence, there are no composition, temperature or pressure gradients in the radial direction. The composition, temperature, and pressure <em>will</em> change as a function of axial position. This is indicated by a gradient in the blue color representing the reacting fluid in the schematic representation, <a href="#fig-pfr_ch6_schematic">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.5</span></a>. As that figure also shows, heat can be exchanged through the entire cylindrical wall of the reactor since the shell/jacket surrounds it.</p>

<p>Another difference between the ideal PFR and the ideal CSTR is the possibility of a drop in the pressure of the reacting fluid as it flows through the reactor. It was noted previously that pressure drop in a CSTR is usually assumed to be negligible. While that <em>may</em> be true for an ideal PFR, the friction between the fluid and the reactor walls and between the fluid and the particles making up a packed bed within the reactor can cause some of the kinetic energy associated with the flow to degrade into heat. The effect upon the energy balance is typically negligible, but this degradation of mechanical energy to heat also results in pressure drop. A momentum balance (also called a mechanical energy balance) is used to calculate the pressure drop. The <strong>momentum balance equation</strong> for an ideal PFR is shown in <a href="#eq-pfr_transient_momentum_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.36</span></a>.</p>

<p>In some situations the pressure drop in an ideal PFR can be negligible. In that case, a <strong>momentum balance</strong> is not used when modeling the reactor. If the pressure drop is not negligible, or if it isn’t known whether the pressure drop is significant, a momentum balance <em>is</em> used. The steady-state, ideal PFR momentum balance can take one of two forms. If the reacting fluid is the only thing in the reactor, the steady-state momentum balance shown in <a href="#eq-pfr_momentum_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.42</span></a> is used. If the reactor contains solid particles in the form of a packed bed, the steady-state momentum balance shown in <a href="#eq-pfr_ergun_eqn">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.43</span></a> is used instead.

<h2 data-number="6.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-soln_of_design_equations"><span class="header-section-number">6.8</span> Numerical Solution of the Reactor Design Equations</h2>
<p>In <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em>, the transient PFR reactor design equations are not used in any analyses. Consequently, in all but two cases, the reactor design equations are a set of coupled, initial-value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). The numerical solution of sets of IVODEs is discussed in <a href="apndx_solve_ivodes.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>I</span></a>. For present purposes, the following points are important.</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of IVODEs must equal the number of dependent variables appearing in them.</li>
<li>To solve a set of IVODEs numerically, equations must be written to calculate every quantity appearing in them from known constants, the independent variable, and the dependent variables.</li>
<li>The solution of IVODEs begins at a value of the independent variable where the value of every dependent variable is known. These “initial values” must be specified when solving the IVODEs.</li>
<li>IVODEs are solved by increasing the independent variable in small increments and calculating the values of the dependent variables each time the independent variable is incremented. When solving IVODEs, a “stopping” criterion must be specified to indicate when to stop incrementing the independent variable. The stopping criterion is a value for <em>one</em> of the dependent variables or for the independent variable. When that value is reached the solution is complete and the solver stops incrementing the independent variable.</li>
<li>The numerical solution of a set of IVODEs is a set of values of the independent variables and each of the dependent variables spanning the range from the initial values to the point where the stopping criterion was satisifed.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the two cases where the reactor design equations are <em>not</em> a set of IVODEs occurs when a steady-state PFR is heated or cooled using sensible heat of the exchange fluid and the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid is not known. In this case the design equations are a set of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), specifically a set IVODEs coupled to one algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE). The numerical solution of DAEs is discussed in <a href="apndx_solve_daes.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>L</span></a>. In this case, the important points with respect to numerical solution of the reactor design equations are almost the same. The differences are (i) that in addition to solving the IVODEs as above, the one additional unknown quantity from the ATE is found and (ii) the equations in the second bullet above can use the unknown in the ATE in addition to constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.</p>
<p>The other case where the reactor design equations are <em>not</em> a set of IVODEs occurs when the reactor is a steady-state CSTR. In this case, the reactor design equations are a set of ATEs. The numerical solution of sets of ATEs is discussed in <a href="apndx_solve_ates.html">Appendix&nbsp;<span>H</span></a>. The important points with respect to numerical solution of a set of ATEs are as follow.</p>
<ul>
<li>A set of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> ATEs can be solved to find the values of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> unknown quantities appearing in them.</li>
<li>The <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> unknowns to be found by solving the ATEs must be specified.</li>
<li>To solve the set of ATEs numerically, equations must be written to calculate every quantity appearing in them from known constants and the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> unknowns.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> assumes that the reactor design equations will be solved numerically. There are many, many software packages that can be used to do this. Because different readers will uses different software packages, <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> does not present computer code that performs the calculations. It does, however, fully formulate the calculations in a manner that the reader can use to write the necessary computer code for their software of choice.</p>
<p>While there are instances where doing so isn’t necessary, <strong>in <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> the design equations are always solved numerically to find the reactor output variables</strong> (see <a href="#tbl-reactor_variables">Table&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a>). That is, when formulating the solution of the design equations, it is always assumed that the reactor inputs, reactor parameters, fluid properties, and reaction properties are known. The reasons for this won’t be discussed here, but it can be noted that in all cases except for steady-state CSTRs (where the design equations are ATEs), this is necessary for numerical solution.</p>
<p>Additional calculations that use the results from solving the design equations are often required to complete an analysis. In <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em>, this is accomplished by solving the design equations within a reactor response function as described in <a href="section_3_response_function.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;7</span></a>. The response function is a computer function or subroutine. Later chapters will show how missing reactor inputs or reactor parameters can be passed to the response function so that the design equations then can be solved for the reactor outputs. Once the design equations have been solved within the response function, any other quantities that depend upon the reactor outputs can be calculated and returned by the response function.</p>

<p>The examples in this chapter illustrate choosing those design equations that are needed to model the reactors described in the example.

The solution of the design equations and the ancillary equations needed for doing so will be described and discussed in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>This problem doesn’t ask me to calculate anything. It asks me to write the minimum number of design equations for the system. The design equations always include mole balances for each of the inert reagents, so I’ll need a mole balance for reagent I. The minimum number of additional mole balances equals the number of mathematically independent reactions that are taking place. In this case only one reaction is occurring, so I will need one additional mole balance on one of the reactants or products. I’ll write it for reactant A.</p>
<p>The problem also states that the reactor operates isothermally and the temperature is known. That means the mole balances can be solved separately from the energy balances. Momentum balances are not used with stirred tanks. Solving the mole balances will yield the molar amounts <em>vs</em>. time, so the minimum set of design equations consists of a mole balance on I and a mole balance on A (or B, or Y, or Z).</p>

<p>Prior to the widespread availability of computers it was quite common to formulate reactor modeling equations using the minimum number of mole balances. In a problem like this one where the reactor is isothermal, doing so often makes it possible to solve the IVODE design equation analytically.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that energy balances were not needed here because the problem specifically stated that the composition of the reactor over time was to be modeled. For an isothermal system where the temperature is known, the mole balances can be solved independently of the energy balances. An alternative assignment might have provided additional information and asked the coolant flow rate as a function of time that would be necessary to operate the reactor isothermally. For that assignment the energy balances would be needed, even though the mole balances still could be solved independently of them.</p>

<li>The volume was assumed to be constant when writing the design equations for this assignment. In chemical processing equipment there are almost never moving reactor walls. As a consequence, when the reacting fluid is an ideal gas or an ideal liquid solution, the reactor volume can always be assumed to be fixed, meaning its time derivative may always be assumed to be zero. In <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em>, the assignment would explicity say so if this was not true.</li>

<p>The exothermic, liquid-phase acid neutralization, reaction (1), occurs in an ideal SBSTR. The heat of reaction and heat capacity of the solution are constant. The rate is second order overall, first order in each reactant, equation (2). Initially a volume, <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span>, of solution at temperature, <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>, is present in the reactor. That solution contains only B at a concentration of <span class="math inline">\(C_{B0}\)</span>. To start the process another solution containing only A at a concentration of <span class="math inline">\(C_{A,in}\)</span> and a temperature of <span class="math inline">\(T_{in}\)</span> begins flowing into the reactor. The volumetric flow rate of the added solution increases linearly with time according to equation (3), where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a known constant. The pressure, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, is constant. The reactor jacket initially contains chilled water at a temperature of <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex,0}\)</span>. At the same time that the reactant solution starts flowing into the reactor, chilled water at <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex,in}\)</span> starts to flow into the jacket. The volumetric flow rate of the chilled water is constant during the process and equal to <span class="math inline">\(\dot V_{ex,in}\)</span>. The reactor jacket volume is <span class="math inline">\(V_{ex}\)</span>, the heat transfer area is <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and the heat transfer coefficient is <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. The reactant solution flows into the reactor for a period of time, <span class="math inline">\(t_f\)</span>, after which the process ends.</p>

Energy balances on the reacting fluid and the exchange fluid must also be included.
