# Acronyms, Notation, and Sign Conventions {#sec-apndx_notation}

This appendix describes acronyms, notation, and sign conventions that are used throughout *Reaction Engineering Basics*.

## Acronyms

The primary use of acronyms in *Reaction Engineering Basics* is to identify reactor types and mathematical equation types. The first time each of the acronyms listed here is used, its meaning is stated, but after that these common acronyms are used without explanation.

| Acronym | Meaning |
|:--------|:-----|
| ATE | Algebraic-transcendental equation |
| BSTR | Batch stirred-tank reactor |
| BVODE | Boundary value ordinary differential equation |
| CSTR | Continuous (flow) stirred-tank reactor |
| DAE | Differential-algebraic equation |
| IVODE | Initial value ordinary differential equation |
| PFR | Plug-flow reactor |
| SBSTR | Semi-batch stirred tank reactor |

## Notation

The last section of each chapter and appendix in *Reaction Engineering Basics* lists the symbols and their meaning as used in that chapter or appendix. This appendix describes notation that is used throughout the book's symbols and equations.

**Dots over variable symbols** are used in *Reaction Engineering Basics* to designate flow variables.

* $n_i$ represents the moles of $i$ whereas $\dot n_i$ represents the molar flow rate of $i$.
* $W$ represents work (energy) whereas $\dot W$ represents the rate of doing work (power).

**A vertical bar with a subscript** is used in *Reaction Engineering Basics* to specify the conditions at which a quantity is evaluated.

* $\Delta H_j^0 \Bigr\rvert_{T=\text{300 K}}$ represents the standard enthalpy change for reaction $j$ *evaluated at* 300 K.
* $n_A \Bigr\rvert_{t=0}$ represents the moles of A *at* $t=0$.

**Summations and continuous products** will occastionally indicate a lower value and an upper value of the index. More commonly in *Reaction Engineering Basics*, only the index variable will be shown. This means that *all possible values of the index* should be included. For example, in *Reaction Engineering Basics* the subscript $j$ indicates one of the reactions taking place in the system. Thus, in the following equation the summation in the numerator includes rate of generation of D in every reaction taking place in the system and the summation in the denominator includes the rate of generation of $i$ in every reaction taking place in the system.

$$
Y_{D/i,inst} = - \frac{\displaystyle \sum _j r_{D,j}}{\displaystyle \sum _j r_{i,j}}
$$

In some instances the sum or product of some sub-set of the indexed quantity is desired. In these cases in *Reaction Engineering Basics* the index variable will typically have a prime ($^\prime$) and the items to be included in the sum or product will be indicated immediately following the equation. As an example, in the following equation only the stoichiometric coefficients of $i$ and the apparent extents of reaction for reactions in a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system are included in the summation.

$$
\dot n_i = \dot n_{i,in} + \sum_{j^\prime} \nu_{i,j^\prime} \dot \xi_{j^\prime}
$$

| $\qquad$ where $j^\prime$ indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically
| $\qquad \qquad$ independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system.

**Confidence Intervals** for estimated parameters are reported as

> value, 95% CI [lower_limit, upper_limit].

For example, $m$ = 10 g, 95% CI [9.3, 11.2] means that the estimated value of $m$ is 10 g with a 95% confidence interval between 9.3 and 11.2 g.

**The Maximum and Minimum** of a variable or function, $y$, are designated as follows:

$$
\max \left(y\right) \qquad \qquad \min \left(y\right)
$$

The value of $x$ at which $y$ is maximized or minimized is written as follows:

$$
\underset{x}{\arg\max} \left(y\right) \qquad \qquad \underset{x}{\arg\min} \left(y\right)
$$

## Sign Conventions

During the derivation of some of the equations presented in *Reaction Engineering Basics* a mathematical sign (i. e. positive *vs*. negative) must be assigned to some quantities. The resulting sign conventions for *Reaction Engineering Basics* are as follow:

* Stoichiometric coefficients of reactants are **negative**.
* Stoichiometric coefficients of products are **positive**.
* If a reagent is neither a reactant nor a product in a given reaction , its stoichiometric coefficient in that reaction is **zero**.
* Heat *added to* a system is **positive**.
* Work *done by* a system is **positive**.
