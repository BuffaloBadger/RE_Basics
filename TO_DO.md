Things to do or think about doing

* Change examples in chapters 1 through 4 to match chapter 5.
* Change subscript "e" to "ex" in equations in Appendix D and fix energy balance for latent heat so it does not have a derivative and includes the fraction of the exchange fluid that condenses.
* Revise preface once SCoRE is available.
* As SCoRE video is added for each example, add link to the numerical calculations videos (python) and (Matlab)
* Add illustration of laminar, turbulent and plug flow to prerequsite knowledge section on fluids; see slide 18 in VO Slides - RE Basics 1.3
* Add README; include license, note that there is a separate repository for the solution of the example problems, and that results are read from that repository when rendering *Reaction Engineering Basics*.
* Add link for reporting errors
* Fix figures in Appendix D so they all have the same size.
