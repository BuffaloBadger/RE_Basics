Things to do or think about doing

* Revise all equations with indices to include "where..."
* Revise 4.4.3 to note that unimolecular reactions aren't elementary but note that equations 4.15 and 4.16 will given the correct mathematical form except for gas phase systems at very low pressures.
* Revise preface once SCoRE is available.
* As SCoRE video is added for each example, add link to the numerical calculations videos (python) and (Matlab)
* Add illustration of laminar, turbulent and plug flow to prerequsite knowledge section on fluids; see slide 18 in VO Slides - RE Basics 1.3
* Add README; include license, note that there is a separate repository for the solution of the example problems, and that results are read from that repository when rendering *Reaction Engineering Basics*.
* Add link for reporting errors
