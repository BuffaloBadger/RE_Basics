# Response, Optimization and Design of Reactors {#sec-5_response_opt_design}

This section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* focuses on the reaction engineering analysis of an isolated ideal reactor. The analyses involve only a reactor and no other equipment. This first chapter is not specific to any one type of reactor, it applies equally to reaction engineering of BSTRs, SBSTRs, CSTRs, and PFRs. It begins by presenting distinguishing characteristics of isolated reactor modeling problems. It then offers a general description of three common reaction engineering tasks: reactor response tasks, reactor optimization tasks, and reactor design tasks. Finally it describes the general approach to modeling isolated reactors that is used to solve response, optimization and design problems in the remaining chapters of this section of *Reaction Engineering Basics*.

## Isolated Ideal Reactor Analysis

Reactors are typically one component of a larger chemical process. That process might include heat exchangers, other reactors, splitting and mixing of fluid streams, and many other types of equipment. Nonetheless, for analysis purposes it often is possible to draw an imaginary box around only the reactor, and treat it as an isolated system. If the reactor is a BSTR, SBSTR, CSTR or PFR, that is if the reactor is one of the ideal reactor types, then the system consists of an isolated ideal reactor.

@sec-3_design_eqns defined groups of variables and parameters that appear in the model for a generic isolated reactor. They included reactor inputs, reactor outputs, reactor parameters, fluid properties and reaction properties. In the analysis of isolated ideal reactors, the fluid properties (heat capacities, densities, etc.) and reaction properties (rate expressions, heats of reaction, etc.) are known. Consequently, **in isolated reactor modeling the variable quantities can be grouped as reactor inputs, reactor outputs, and process parameters**. 

Recall from @sec-3_design_eqns, the **reactor inputs** consist of the initial molar amounts (or inlet molar flow rates) of every reagent in the system, the initial (or inlet) temperature of the reacting fluid, the inlet mass flow rate and inlet temperature of the heat exchange fluid (if there is one), and, for plug-flow reactors, the inlet pressure of the reacting fluid. The **reactor outputs** consist of the final molar amounts (or outlet molar flow rates) of every reagent in the system, the final (or outlet) temperature of the reacting fluid, the outlet temperature of the heat exchange fluid (if there is one), and, for plug-flow reactors, the outlet pressure of the reacting fluid. The rate at which the reactor does work on its surroundings is also a reactor output, but for the ideal reactors in chemical processing plants, it is almost always negligible. The **process parameters** include the reactor dimensions (volume, length, diameter, etc., as appropriate), the heat transfer area, the heat transfer coefficient, catalyst bed properties (if there is a catalyst bed), and the reaction time (for a closed system) or the space time (for an open system).

The reactor design equations establish a relationship between the reactor inputs, the reactor outputs, and the process parameters. In any isolated reactor modeling assignment, the reaction engineer is given values for some of the inputs, outputs and parameters and tasked with determining the values of the others. Completing the task virtually always entails solving the reactor design equations, but the manner in which they are solved depends upon the nature of the task.

## Common Reaction Engineering Tasks

To simplify the following discussion of reaction engineering tasks, "reactor variables" will be used to refer to the combined reactor inputs, reactor outputs, and process parameters. Three common isolated reactor modeling tasks are reactor response tasks, reactor optimization tasks, and reactor design tasks. **Reactor response tasks**, as defined here, are the most straightforward of the three. In a reactor response assignment the reaction engineer is provided with a sufficient number of reactor variables to allow calculation of all other reactor variables by solving the reactor design equations. Then, knowing *all* of the inputs, outputs and parameters, any other reactor response of interest, for example the conversion or a selectivity, can be calculated. Generally there is a single, correct answer to a reactor response assignment.

There are **two varieties of response tasks**. In one, the assignment provides all of the inputs and parameters that are needed in order to solve the reactor design equations for the reactor outputs. In the other type, the assignment provides a reactor output (or related response) and is missing a reactor input or parameter, so that the reactor design equations must be solved to find the missing reactor input or parameter. When numerical methods are used to solve the reactor design equations these two types of response task require slightly different computational approaches.

Sometimes it may appear to a student who is just learning reaction engineering that a reactor response assignment does not provide a sufficient number of reactor variables to allow the reactor design equations to be solved. This typically occurs when the assignment asks for a graph plotting two variables against each other. In this case, the reaction engineer may choose values for one of the variables that span the range of interest, solve the design equations to find the corresponding values of the other variable, and plot the resulting data.

In **optimization tasks** the number of reactor variables that are specified or known is not sufficient to allow the reaction engineer to solve the reactor design equations. In lieu of the missing reactor variables, the assignment specifies that the reaction engineer must adjust one or more reactor variables so that the value of another reactor variable, the target variable, is maximized or minimized. The assignment entails finding the optimum value of each adjusted reactor variable *and* the corresponding (minimized or maximized) value of the target variable.

In *Reaction Engineering Basics* almost all optimization tasks will specify only *one* reactor variable to be adjusted and one target variable to be minimized or maximized. A simple optimization assignment like this can be completed by repeatedly solving the reactor design equations for the target variable using different values of the adjusted variable. The resulting data for the target variable *vs*. the adjusted variable can then be plotted or tabulated and the minimum/maximum value of target variable can be identified by inspection of the graph or table.

Optimization tasks can be much more complicated than that, however. The assignment may specify multiple adjusted variables.  There can also be constraints on the values of reactor variables (not just the ones being adjusted). Constraints are conditions that must be obeyed. An example of a constraint would be that the temperature of the heat exchange fluid cannot exceed some specified value. Constrained, multiple variable optimization assignments will not be considered in *Reaction Engineering Basics*, but they usually can be solved by creating a response function as described below and passing that response function to software that performs constrained optimization.

**Reactor design tasks** are the most complicated of the tasks considered here. A reactor design assignment **does not** provide sufficient information to solve the reactor design equations. The reaction engineer must choose values for the missing reactor variables. In more extreme cases, the assignment may provide little more than the reagents that area available and the products that are to be produced. The type of reactor to use and how to operate it may be among the choices the reaction engineer needs to make.

Design tasks almost always involve an optimization sub-task. The quantity that needs to be maximized is typically financial in nature. The goal is to maximize the rate of making profit subject to both technical and financial constraints. Design at this level is typically taught in chemical engineering courses on plant design, and the system being optimized is typically an entire process, not just an isolated reactor.

That level of design task is well beyond the scope of *Reaction Engineering Basics*. However, highly simplified design tasks are presented herein. In general there are reactor variables that are related to the finances of an overall process. For example, the cost of operating a process may scale with the temperature of that process, in which case minimizing the temperature minimizes operating cost. Design tasks in *Reaction Engineering Basics* use reactor variables as the quantities to be optimized. In general, there **is not** a single correct solution to a reactor design assignment. Design tasks are inherently “open-ended,” and multiple solutions are possible and acceptable.

## Creating a Response Function for Modeling Isolated Ideal Reactors

 @sec-3_design_eqns described how to generate, simplify and solve the reactor design equations for each of the four ideal reactor types. @sec-3_response_func then introduced computer functions that were called response functions. Response functions are useful when numerical methods are used to complete reaction engineering tasks. In chapters [-@sec-4_kin_data_gen] through [-@sec-4_pfr_data_analysis] response functions were used for kinetics data analysis. This section presents an overview of the use of response functions for the completion isolated reactor modeling assignments. The discussion here may seem a bit abstract, but it will be illustrated in every example in Chapters [-@sec-5_bstr_analysis] through [-@sec-5_continuous_design].

 @fig-response_fcn, a schematic representation of a response function, indicated three kinds of arguments that can be passed to response functions. Those argument types are called adjusted values, missing values and solver guesses. For the most part, solver guess arguments are used when using response functions to model isolated *steady-state* CSTRs. The design equations for a steady-state CSTR are algebraic-transcendental equations (ATEs), and solving them typically requires providing an initial guess for the unknown quantities. The design equations for all the other reactor types considered in *Reaction Engineering Basics* are sets of initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). The solution of IVODEs does not require a guess for the unknowns, so solver guess arguments are not passed to the response function.

 Adjusted value arguments are used for optimization tasks, where they are the values that are being adjusted so as to minimize or maximize the target variable. Adjusted value arguments are also used for response tasks that involve construction of graphs, where they are typically values of the quantity being plotted on the abscissa ($x$-axis). If the adjusted value arguments include a reactor input, that reactor input is not a missing value and it is not passed to the response function as a missing value argument.

 Missing value arguments, then, are only passed to the response function when the assignment doesn't provide the value of a reactor input *and* the missing reactor input is *not* an adjusted variable. Under those conditions, the assignment *will* specify the value of one reactor output or process parameter. Recall, within the response function, the reactor design equations are solved, and the results are used to calculate any other responses of interest. Importantly, **the reactor output or process parameter that is specifiec in the assignment *must* be calculated within the response function and returned along with any other responses of interest**.

 At first it may seem odd to calculate and return the value of the specified response since its value is known. The reason for this is that it allows the response function to be used to calculate the missing reactor input. The response function can be thought of as providing the specified response, given the missing reactor input, @eq-resp_func_as_specified_input, where $\Omega$ is used to represent the response function, $y_{out}$ is the value of the specified reactor output predicted by the model, and $x_{in}$ is the missing reactor input.

$$
\Omega\left(x_{in}\right) = y_{out,model}
$${#eq-resp_func_as_specified_input}

If the response function is given the correct value of the missing input, $x_{in,true}$ it will then return the correct value of specified response, $y_{out,specified}$. This can be written as an ATE, and converted to the form of a residual equation, @eq-resp_func_as_residual_eqn. Having done so, that residual equation can be solved numerically using an ATE solver to find the missing input, $x_{in,true}$. Knowing the true value of the missing input, the response function can then be called to find the values of the other responses of interest that it returns.

$$
\Omega\left(x_{in,true}\right) = y_{out,specified} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 0 = \Omega\left(x_{in,true}\right) - y_{out,specified}
$${#eq-resp_func_as_residual_eqn}

## General Approach to Modeling Isolated Ideal Reactors

A reaction engineer must know two things when given an assignment. The first is how to identify the assignment's type, and the second is to know the general approach that is used when solving that type of assignment. **Isolated ideal reactor modeling assignments can be identified** by the following distinguishing characteristics.

* The system consists of one ideal reactor and no other equipment.
* The assignment describes the reactor and how it is operated.
* The reactions taking place are known, and rate expressions are available for them.
* The assignment asks for a reactor parameter, a reactor input, or reactor output.

Having identified an assigment as an isolated ideal reactor modeling assignment, **the general approach to completing the assignment** is as follows.

1. Write the reactor design equations for the reactor.
2. Assuming any missing reactor input or process parameter will be available, formulate their solution to find the reactor outputs.
3. Write the ancillary equations needed to calculate the response(s) of interest and any specified response.
4. Create a response function that
	a. receives any missing quantities from step 2 as arguments,
	b. solves the design equations for the reactor outputs, and
	c. uses the reactor outputs to calculate and return the responses of interest and any specified response.
5. Use the response function to calculate all quantities of interest.
	a. If there are no missing reactor inputs or process parameters, calculate the responses of interest directly using the response function.
	b. If a reactor input or  or process parameter is unknown, use the response function to create a residual equation as in @eq-resp_func_as_residual_eqn and use it to calculate the missing reactor input or  or process parameter using an ATE solver. Then the result can be passed to the response function to find the other responses of interest.
	c. If a range of values are of interest, repeat step 5a or 5b over the range of interest and tabulate or plot the results.
	d. If a maximum or minimum value is of interest, identify the maximum using the table or plot from step 5c.
