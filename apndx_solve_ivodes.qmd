# Solving Initial-Value ODEs {#sec-apndx_solve_ivodes}

This appendix examines the numerical solution of sets of initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). There are many software packages that include an IVODE solver (a function that can be used to solve sets of IVODEs). Under the assumption that different readers will choose to use different software packages, the discussion in this appendix is general. Nonetheless it provides sufficient information for readers to follow *Reaction Engineering Basics* examples wherein sets of IVODEs ae solved, and to implement them using the IVODE solver they prefer. Of course it will be necessary to consult the documentation for the chosen solver to learn the details for using it. Readers seeking a more complete understanding of how IVODE solvers work should consult a numerical methods textbook or take a course on numerical methods.

## Identifying IVODEs

A differential equation contains at least one derivative. A distinguishing feature of a set of **ordinary** differential equations is that every derivative that appears in the equations has the same independent variable. Put differently, there are no partial derivatives in a set of ordinary differential equations. In virtually all cases, the sets of IVODEs that are solved in *Reaction Engineering Basics* are linear, first-order ODEs. That means that there are no higher order derivatives in the equations and that there are no products, quotients or powers of the first-order derivatives.

Thus, the sets of IVODEs under consideration here will take the form shown in Equations [-@eq-example-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-ode-4]. In those equations $x$ is the independent variable; $y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$, and $y_4$ are the dependent variables; and $m_{1,1}$ through $m_{4,4}$ and $g_1$ through $g_4$ can be constants or functions of the independent and dependent variables.

$$
m_{1,1}\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{1,2}\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{1,3}\frac{dy_3}{dx} + m_{1,4}\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_1 
$$ {#eq-example-ode-1}

$$
m_{2,1}\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{2,2}\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{2,3}\frac{dy_3}{dx} + m_{2,4}\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_2 
$$ {#eq-example-ode-2}

$$
m_{3,1}\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{3,2}\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{3,3}\frac{dy_3}{dx} + m_{3,4}\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_3 
$$ {#eq-example-ode-3}

$$
m_{4,1}\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{4,2}\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{4,3}\frac{dy_3}{dx}  + m_{4,4}\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_4 
$$ {#eq-example-ode-4}

While four equations are being used here for illustration purposes, there can be any number of ordinary differential equations in the set as long as the number of ordinary differential equations is equal to the number of dependent variables, and there is only one independent variable. In *Reaction Engineering Basics*, the independent variable is either the elapsed time, $t$, or the axial position, $z$, measured from the inlet of a plug flow reactor.

Numerical solution finds the values of the independent and dependent variables over a continuous range. The values of the independent and dependent variables at the start of that range are called their **initial values**, and the values of the independent and dependent variables at the end of the range are called their final values.

## IVODE Solvers

The inner workings of IVODE solvers are beyond the scope of *Reaction Engineering Basics*. Nonetheless, a simplified understanding of how IVODEs are solved numerically is useful. When an IVODE solver is called, it must be provided with the following arguments: the initial values, the stopping criterion (i. e. the final value of either the independent variable or one of the dependent variables), and a derivatives function. As described below, the derivatives function uses the IVODEs to calculate and return the values of the derivatives appearing in the IVODEs.

The solver starts from the initial values, as illustrated graphically in part (a) of @fig-ivode-integration-step for any one of the dependent variables. It isn't possible to plot $y$ *vs.* $x$ at that point because $y\left(x\right)$ is not known. (Indeed, $y\left(x\right)$ is the solution to the IVODE.) Instead, the solver uses the IVODEs to calculate the value of each of the derivatives at $\left(x_0,y_0\right)$. The derivative, $\frac{dy}{dx}$, at that point is the slope of the unknown function at $\left(x_0,y_0\right)$. This is shown graphically in part (b) of @fig-ivode-integration-step.

![Graphical Representation of an IVODE Integration Step. (a) The initial value. (b) The slope at that point. (c) Incrementally increasing x and approximating the corresponding y.](./Graphics/IVODE_Integration_Step.png){#fig-ivode-integration-step}

Starting from the known point, $\left(x_0,y_0\right)$, the solver increases $x$ by a small amount, $\Delta x$, which is known as the *step-size*. It then calculates the corresponding change in $y$, $\Delta y$, using the slope. The resulting point, $\left(x_1,y_1\right)$, is shown in part (c) of @fig-ivode-integration-step. This process is sometimes referred to as taking an integration step. Effectively, the solver uses the small straight line segment between $\left(x_0,y_0\right)$ and $\left(x_1,y_1\right)$ to approximate the true solution, $y\left(x\right)$, in that interval. The accuracy of this approximation increases as $\Delta x$ decreases, so typically the solver uses a large number of very small steps.

Of course, the solver eventually must stop taking integration steps. After completing each step, the solver checks to determine whether making that step resulted in the stopping criterion being satisfied. If not, the solver takes another integration step. As an example, suppose the stopping criterion is that $y_3$ should equal some value, $y_{3,f}$, the solver would check to see whether $y_3$ did, in fact, reach or surpass $y_{3,f}$ after making the step. In most cases the stopping criterion will have been surpassed by some small amount, in which case the solver interpolates to find final values that exactly satisfy the stopping criterion. It then returns the values of the dependent variables and the independent variable for all of the steps it took while solving the IVODEs, including those final interpolated values.

### Cautions Related to Numerical Solution of IVODEs

*When the stopping criterion is a value of one of the dependent variables*, many solvers require that you provide *both* a final value of the independent variable *and* the known final value of that dependent variable. The solver then takes steps as described above, and after each step it checks to see whether either variable has reached its specified final value. The problem is that if you specify a final value of the *independent* variable that is too small, the solver may reach that value first and stop. The stopping criterion you specified for the dependent variable will not have been reached, and the result that is returned is not the result you are seeking. Therefore it is important to **check that the dependent variable reached the specified final value**.

To avoid having the solver stop because it reached the stopping criterion for the *independent* variable, it is tempting to specify a very large final value for the independent variable stopping criterion. The problem with doing this is that it may cause the solver to use a step size that is too large, resulting in an inaccurate solution. Therefore, it is important to **check that the step size was not too large**. The solution that is returned will include the final value of the independent variable. The stopping criterion for the independent variable can be set to a value slightly larger than that and the equations can be solved a second time. Assuming the second solution reaches the desired stopping criterion for the dependent variable, the second solution should be accurate.

A second possible problem arises when solving sets of IVODEs where one of the dependent variables changes very abruptly over a very small range of the independent variable. The abrupt changes in that dependent variable may significantly affect the other dependent variables over a much broader range of the independent variable. Equations like this are called **stiff ODEs**, and they require special treatment of the step size. Therefore, when solving sets of ODEs, one should pay attention to whether any of the dependent variables change very abruptly as the independent variable changes. If they do, it is advisable to repeat the solution using a solver that is specifically tailored to stiff ODEs.

## Input Required by IVODE Solvers

The preceeding discussion shows that IVODE solvers need three things in order to solve a set of IVODEs. The first are the initial values from which the solver will take the first integration step. The second is the name of a function, written by the reaction engineer, that the solver can use to evaluate the derivatives, that is to calculate the numerical values of the derivatives. Herein, this function will be referred to as the derivatives function. The third required input to an IVODE solver is a stopping criterion that the solver can use to decide when to stop taking integration steps. As noted above, a stopping criterion has two parts: the identity of the variable (the independent variable or one of the dependent variables) and its final value.

### Derivative Expressions and the Derivatives Function  {#sec-mass_matrix}

It was noted above that one input required by an IVODE solver is the name of a function, written by the reaction engineer, that the solver can use to evaluate the derivatives. More specifically, the derivatives function must accept the independent variable and the dependent variables corresponding to the start of an integration step as input arguments, and it must use them to calculate and return the values of the derivatives that appear in the IVODEs.

To do so, it is useful to convert the IVODEs into a set of expressions for the individual derivatives if they aren't already in that form. For example, Equations [-@eq-example-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-ode-4] need to be converted to derivative expressions of the form shown in Equations [-@eq-example-vector-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-vector-ode-4] where $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, and $f_4$ each may be a function of $x$, $y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$, and $y_4$.

$$
\frac{dy_1}{dx}  = f_1 
$$ {#eq-example-vector-ode-1}

$$
\frac{dy_2}{dx} = f_2 
$$ {#eq-example-vector-ode-2}

$$
\frac{dy_3}{dx} = f_3 
$$ {#eq-example-vector-ode-3}

$$
\frac{dy_4}{dx} = f_4 
$$ {#eq-example-vector-ode-4}

That can be accomplished by algebraic manipulation of Equations [-@eq-example-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-ode-4], but it is particularly straightforward if the original IVODEs are written as a matrix equation. The coefficients in Equations [-@eq-example-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-ode-4], $m_{1,1}$, $m_{1,2}$, etc., can be used to construct a so-called mass matrix, $\boldsymbol{M}$, as shown in @eq-mass-matrix, the dependent variables can be used to construct a column vector, $\underline{y}$, as in equation @eq-dependent-var-vector, and the functions, $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$, and $g_4$, can be used to construct a column vector, $\underline{g}$, as in equation @eq-function-vector.

$$
\boldsymbol{M} = \begin{bmatrix} m_{1,1} \ m_{1,2} \ m_{1,3} \ m_{1,4} \\m_{2,1} \ m_{2,2} \ m_{2,3} \ m_{2,4} \\m_{3,1} \ m_{3,2} \ m_{3,3} \ m_{3,4} \\ m_{4,1} \ m_{4,2} \ m_{4,3} \ m_{4,4}  \end{bmatrix}
$$ {#eq-mass-matrix}

$$
\underline{y} = \begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ y_3 \\ y_4 \end{bmatrix}
$$ {#eq-dependent-var-vector}

$$
\underline{g} = \begin{bmatrix} g_1 \\ g_2 \\ g_3 \\ g_4 \end{bmatrix}
$$ {#eq-function-vector}

Equations [-@eq-example-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-ode-4] then can be written as a matrix equation, @eq-matrix-form-ivode. Pre-multiplying each side of @eq-matrix-form-ivode by the inverse of the mass matrix yields the desired derivative expressions, @eq-matrix-form-of-vector-ivodes. That is, comparing @eq-matrix-form-of-vector-ivodes to Equations [-@eq-example-vector-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-vector-ode-4], it is apparent that they are equivalent with  $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, and $f_4$ given by @eq-g-in-terms-of-f.

$$
\boldsymbol{M}\frac{d}{dx}\underline{y} = \underline{g}
$$ {#eq-matrix-form-ivode}

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\underline{y} = \boldsymbol{M}^{-1} \underline{g}
$$ {#eq-matrix-form-of-vector-ivodes}

$$
\begin{bmatrix} f_1 \\ f_2 \\ f_3 \\ f_4 \end{bmatrix} = \underline{f} = \boldsymbol{M}^{-1} \underline{g}
$$ {#eq-g-in-terms-of-f}

Wring the IVODEs in the form of derivatives expressions, facilitates evaluating the derivatives. The derivatives function will be provided with the independent and dependent variables as arguments. They can be used, along with known constants provided as part of the assignment, to evaluate each of the $f$ functions in Equations [-@eq-example-vector-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-vector-ode-4], or equivalently in @eq-g-in-terms-of-f.

The $f$ functions may also contain other variables and possibly, an **unknown constant**. The other variables clearly must be calculated in order to evaluate the $f$ functions. This is done using expressions for those other variables in terms of known constants and the independent and dependent variables.

If the $f$ functions contain an unknown constant, that, too, must be calculated before the $f$ functions can be evaluated. Here, saying it is unknown means that it cannot be calculated directly using the known constants given as part of the assignment. In the examples presented in *Reaction Engineering Basics* there will be at most one such unknown constant.

When the IVODEs, or equivalently the $f$ functions, contain an unknown constant, the assignment will provide two final values. One of the two final values is used to specify the stopping criterion. The other final value is used to calculate the unknown constant. Doing this is described below. The important point here is that **the unknown constant must be calculated before calling the IVODE solver**, and after doing so, its value must be made available to the derivatives function.

So to summarize, if the IVODEs contain an unknown constant, its value must be calculated before calling the IVODE solver, and it must be made available within the derivatives function. Similarly, the known constants given as part of the assignment must also be available within the derivatives function. When the reaction engineer writes the derivatives function, it should receive the independent and dependent variables as arguments. It should first calculate the values of any variables other than the independent and dependent variables. Then it should evaluate the $f$ functions using Equations [-@eq-example-vector-ode-1] through [-@eq-example-vector-ode-4], or equivalently in @eq-g-in-terms-of-f. Finally it should return the resulting values of the derivatives.

### Initial Values and the Stopping Criterion

The initial and final values are constants. If their values are not given as part of the assignment, they must be calculated before the IVODEs can be solved. In most instances, if they are not provided as part of an assignment, they can be calculated using other constants that are given in the assignment. As an example, the assignment might give the volume of the system and initial concentrations of reagents from which the initial molar amounts can be calculated.

There *might* be one initial value that cannot be calculated directly using the constants provided in the assignment. This situation is same as that described above when an unknown constant is present in the IVODEs, and the value of that constant is calculated the same way. If there is an unknown initial value, two final values will be known. One will be used to specify the stopping criterion and the other will be used to calculate the unknown initial value. As before, the value of this unknown constant must be calculated *before* the IVODE solver is called. The only difference is that after it is calculated, it must be made available at the point in the code where the IVODE solver is called. (In the case of an unknown constant appearing in the IVODEs, it must be made available within the derivatives function.) The calculation of an unknown constant is described below.

Specifying the stopping criterion is straightforward. The final value or values are always known or can be calculated from other known constants provided as part of the assignment. Specifying the stopping criterion simply entails identifying which variable's final value is known and providing that value. The initial values and the stopping criterion are passed directly to the IVODE solver when it is called, so as already noted, they must be calculated before the IVODE solver is called.

### Calculating the Unknown Constant

Many of the examples presented in *Reaction Engineering Basics* that require solving a set of IVODEs do not have an unknown constant either in the equations or as an initial value. In examples that do have an unknown constant, there will only be one, either an unknown constant appearing in the IVODEs or an unknown initial value. In both cases, the value of the unknown constant is calculated using a second known final value. (The other known final value is used to specify the stopping criterion.)

To illustrate, let $a$ represent the unknown constant, let $x_f$ represent the first known final value, let $y_{i,f}$ represent the second known final value, and let $y_i\big\vert_{x=x_f}$ represent the final value that is found by solving the IVODEs. The unknown constant, $a$, can be described as the value of $a$ that results in $y_i\big\vert_{x=x_f}$, being equal to $y_{i,f}$, or in mathematical terms as $a: y_i\big\vert_{x=x_f} = y_{i,f}$. This description can be converted to an implicit equation for $a$ shown in @eq-implicit_initial_value_eqn. That equation is written in the form of a residual expression (see @sec-apndx_solve_ates), anticipating that it will be solved numerically using an ATE solver. Put differently @eq-implicit_initial_value_eqn can be treated as an ATE with $a$ as the only unknown.

$$
0 = y_i\big\vert_{x=x_f} - y_{i,f} = \epsilon
$$ {#eq-implicit_initial_value_eqn}

The numerical solution of ATEs like this is described in @sec-apndx_solve_ates. Very briefly, to calculate $a$, an ATE solver is called passing two arguments. The first argument is a guess for $a$ and the second is a residuals function written by the reaction engineer. The residuals functions receives a guess for $a$. It makes it available to the code that needs it, and then calls an IVODE solver to solve the IVODEs. Finally, it uses the results from solving the IVODEs to evaluate and return the residual, @eq-implicit_initial_value_eqn. When the ATE solver returns the value of $a$, it is made available to other code as necessary. At that point, the IVODEs can be solved.

## Formulating the Solution of a Set of IVODEs Mathematically {#sec-math_form_ivodes}

As discussed above solving a set of IVODEs requires writing code that (a) evaluates the derivatives appearing in the IVODEs and (b) calculates the initial values. In essence, mathematical formulation of the solution entails writing the equations that are needed to perform those calculations and describing how to use those equations to perform the calculations. Starting with a set of $N$ IVODEs that contain $N$ dependent variables, the formulation proceeds as follows.

1. Write the IVODEs in the form of derivative expressions if they aren't already written as such.
2. Write the equations needed to use the independent and dependent variables to calculate
    a. variables other than the independent and dependent variables,
    b. the unknown constant appearing in the IVODEs, if there is one, and
    c. the values of the derivatives.
3. Specify the initial values and the stopping criterion.
4. Write the equations needed to calculate the initial and final values, including the unknown initial value, if there is one.
5. Describe how to use the equations written in step 2 to evaluate the derivatives.
6. Describe how to use the equations written in step 4 to calculate the initial and final values.

## Implementing the Solution of a Set of IVODEs Numerically {#sec-num_impl_ivodes}

Numerical implementation of the solution entails writing code that solves the IVODEs using the equations and information from the mathematical formulation together with an IVODE solver. The specifics of writing the code will depend upon the IVODE solver that is being used. Herein the implementation is presented in general terms that provide sufficient detail so that the solution can be implemented using mathematics software of the reader's choosing.

The structure of the code will depend upon the mathematics software being used and programmer preference. For any one mathematics software, there may be multiple ways to structure the code. *Reaction Engineering Basics* assumes that the code will be broken into computer functions that each perform a specific task.

reactor model function
: sets the initial values and stopping criterion, calls the IVODE solver, and returns corresponding sets of values of the independent variable and each of the dependent variables spanning the range from their initial value to their final value.

derivatives function
: receives the independent and dependent variables, evaluates the derivatives and returns their values.

residuals function
: receives a guess for the unknown constant, makes it available to the other functions, calls the model function to solve the IVODEs using the guess, uses the results to evaluate the residual corresponding to the unknown constant and return the value of the residual.

top-level code (and/or a master calculations function)
: establishes a mechanism for making quantities available to all functions, calls an ATE solver to calculate the unknown constant, if there is one, makes the value of the unknown constant available to other functions, and calls the reactor model function to get the solution of the IVODEs.

## Examples

[Example -@sec-example_J_6_1] shows how to solve a set of IVODEs numerically when there are no unknown constants within the equations, all of the initial values are known, and one final value is known. Additionally, it illustrates using the mass matrix to write the derivatives function as described in @sec-mass_matrix. Examples [-@sec-example_J_6_2] and [-@sec-example_J_6_2] illustrates the solution of a set of IVODEs when an initial value or constant in the IVODEs is unknown but a second final value is specified. In [Example -@sec-example_J_6_2] an initial value is unknown and in [Example -@sec-example_J_6_3] a constant appearing in the IVODEs is unknown.

In completing this example, I will follow the steps in @sec-reactor_analysis_steps, beginning with a concise summary.  In this example variable symbols have already been assigned to each known constant and the quantities of interest have been identified, so all I need to do is list them.

I will follow the procedure described in @sec-math_form_ivodes to formulate the solution mathematically. In equations (1) through (6), $t$ is the independent variable, and $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $P$ are the dependent variables. During the solution, I will need to calculate the value of each derivative, and that will be easier if equations (1) through (6) are re-written in the form of derivative expressions.

:::

**Reactor Design Equations as Derivative Expressions**

The IVODEs, equations (1) through (6) can be written as the matrix equation, (10), with the mass matrix defined as shown in equation (11). The IVODEs can then be written, in matrix form, as derivative expressions as shown in equation (12).

$$
\boldsymbol{M}\frac{d}{dt} \begin{bmatrix} n_A \\ n_B \\ n_Y \\ n_Z \\ T \\ P \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -Vr_1 \\ -Vr_1 \\ Vr_1 \\ Vr_1 \\ -Vr_1\Delta H_1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\tag{10}
$$

$$
\boldsymbol{M} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \left(n_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + n_B \hat{C}_{p,B} + n_Y \hat{C}_{p,Y} + n_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z} \right) & -V \\ RT & RT & RT & RT & R\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\right) & -V  \end{bmatrix} \tag{11}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \frac{dn_A}{dt} \\ \frac{n_B}{dt} \\ \frac{n_Y}{dt} \\ \frac{n_Z}{dt} \\ \frac{T}{dt} \\ \frac{P}{dt} \end{bmatrix} = \boldsymbol{M}^{-1} \begin{bmatrix} -Vr_1 \\ -Vr_1 \\ Vr_1 \\ Vr_1 \\ -Vr_1\Delta H_1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \tag{12}

During the solution I will need to calculate the values of the derivatives, given the independent and dependent variables. Before I can use the derivatives expressions above to do that, I will need to calculate any other variables and any unknown constant that appear in the derivatives expressions.

The only other variable appearing in these IVODEs is $r$. According to the assignment narrative, the engineer knows the rate expression is equation (7), and that can be used to calculate $r$. However, using the rate expression as an ancillary equation to calculate $r$ introduces two additional variables, $C_A$ and $C_B$, so I need to write ancillary equations for them, too. The necessary equations, (8) and (9), are simply defining equations for concentration in a BSTR. A reaction engineer would know these definitions.

The constants appearing in the IVODEs and the ancillary equations are all known, so I do not need any additional ancillary equations to calculate the derivatives.

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Derivatives**

The rate expression for $r$ is given, equation (7). The concentrations appearing in it can be calculated using equations (8) and (9).

$$
C_A = \frac{n_A}{V} \tag{8}
$$

$$
C_B = \frac{n_B}{V} \tag{9}

In addition to calculating the values of the derivatives, I also will need initial values and a stopping criterion in order to solve the IVODEs. The instant the reaction begins can be defined as $t=0$. In this example the assignment provides all of the initial values as well as the final value as shown in @tbl-example_J_6_1_initial_values. All of the quantities in that table are known constants, so I do not need any ancillary equations to calculate them.

I have now written all of the equations that are needed to solve the IVODEs. I can finish the mathematical formulation of the solution by summarizing how to use them, as described in @sec-math_form_ivodes.

With the information given above, equations (1) through (6) can be solved numerically to find  $n_A\left(t\right)$, $n_B\left(t\right)$, $n_Y\left(t\right)$, $n_Z\left(t\right)$, $T\left(t\right)$, and $P\left(t\right)$. To do so it will be necessary to calculate the following items using the indicated information.

**Calculations Summary**

1. Substitute the given and known constants into all equations.
2. To calculate $r_1$ knowing $t$, $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $P$
    a. calculate $C_A$ and $C_B$ using equations (8) and (9) and then
    b. calculate $r$ using equation (7).
3. To evaluate the derivatives knowing $t$, $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, $n_Z$, $T$, $P$, and $r_1$
    a. calculate the vector on the right side of equation (10), 
    b. calculate $\boldsymbol{M}$ using equation (11), and
    c. evaluate the derivatives using equation (12).

## Note

Derivative expressions could also be generated by algebraic manipulation of the IVODEs. Equations (1) through (4) are already in the form of derivative expressions.

Substitution of equation (1) for $\frac{dn_A}{dt}$, equation (2) for $\frac{dn_B}{dt}$, equation (3) for $\frac{dn_Y}{dt}$, and equation (4) for $\frac{dn_Z}{dt}$ into equation (6) yields equation (13).

-RTVr_1 - RTVr_1 + RTVr_1 + RTVr_1 + R\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\right)\frac{dT}{dt} - V\frac{dP}{dt} = 0
$$

$$
R\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\right)\frac{dT}{dt} - V\frac{dP}{dt} = 0 \tag{13}
$$

Subtracting equation (13) from equation (5)  and rearranging yields the derivative expression in equation (14).

$$
\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{-Vr_1 \Delta H_1}{n_A \left(\hat{C}_{p,A} - R\right) + n_B \left(\hat{C}_{p,B} - R\right) + n_Y \left(\hat{C}_{p,Y} - R\right) + n_Z \left(\hat{C}_{p,Z} - R\right)} \tag{14}
$$

Rearrangement of equation (6) and substitution of equation (14) for $\frac{dT}{dt}$ yields the derivative expression in equation (15).

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{R\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\right)}{V}\frac{dT}{dt}
$$

$$
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{-R\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\right)r_1 \Delta H_1}{n_A \left(\hat{C}_{p,A} - R\right) + n_B \left(\hat{C}_{p,B} - R\right) + n_Y \left(\hat{C}_{p,Y} - R\right) + n_Z \left(\hat{C}_{p,Z} - R\right)} \tag{15}
$$

Step 3 in the Calculations Summary would then be replaced as follows:

3. To evaluate the derivatives knowing $t$, $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, $n_Z$, $T$, $P$, and $r_1$ use equations (1) - (4), (14), and (15).

## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

I will follow the general procedure for numerical implementation of the solution of a set of IVODEs presented in @sec-num_impl_ivodes. In this example there isn't a missing initial value or IVODE constant, so the implementation is straightforward.

:::

1. Make the given and known constants available for use in all functions, 
2. Write a derivatives function that
    a. receives $t$, $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $P$ as arguments,
    b. calculates $r_1$ as described in step 2 of the calculations summary, and
    c. evaluates and returns the derivatives as described in step 3 of the calculations summary.
3. Write a reactor model function that
    a. calls an IVODE solver using the following arguments
        i. the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_J_6_1_initial_values and
        ii. the name of the derivatives function from step 2,
    b. checks that the solver successfully solved the IVODEs, and
    c. returns sets of corresponding values of $t$, $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, $n_Z$, $T$, and $P$ spanning the range from their initial values to their final values.
4. perform the analysis by calling the reactor model function.

Solving the IVODEs numerically does not yield expressions for $n_A\left(t\right)$, $n_B\left(t\right)$, $n_Y\left(t\right)$, $n_Z\left(t\right)$, $T\left(t\right)$, and $P\left(t\right)$. Instead it yields $n_A$ *vs*. $t$, $n_B$ *vs*. $t$, etc., in the form of @tbl-example_J_6_1_ivode_results where the rows span the range from the initial values to the final values.

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Note

The results shown here have 7 values of each variable spanning the range from their initial values to their final values. In most cases, the IVODE solver determines the number of integration steps needed to accurately solve the equations. As a consequence, if the calculations were performed using a different IVODE solver, there could be fewer or more rows than shown in @tbl-example_J_6_1_ivode_results. However, the values shown in the first and last rows would be the same, and interpolation to a common $t$, would give equal values of $n_A$, $n_B$, $n_Y$, $n_Z$, $T$ and $P$.

Following the steps in @sec-reactor_analysis_steps, I will begin by summarizing the assignment. In this example, variable symbols have already been assigned to each known constant. Since this is a flow system, a subscripted "in" is used to denote initial values (at $z=0$) and a subscripted "out" is used for final values. The quantities of interest have been identified, so all I need to do is list the information.

:::

#### Assignment Summary

**Given and Known Constants**: $D$ = 1 in, $k_0$ = 7.49 x 10^9^ L mol^-1^ min^-1^, $E$ = 15,300 cal mol^-1^, $P$ = 4 atm, $\Delta H$ = -14,500 cal mol^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,A}$ = 10.9 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $\hat{C}_{p,Z}$ = 21.8 cal mol^-1^ K^-1^, $L$ = 100 in, $\dot{n}_{A,in}$ = 1.5 mol min^-1^, $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$ = 0, and $T_{out}$ = 400 K.

**Reactor**: Adiabatic, steady-state PFR with negligible pressure drop.
 
**Quantities of Interest**: $T_{in}$, $\dot{n}_A\left(z\right)$, $\dot{n}_Z\left(z\right)$, and $T\left(z\right)$.

#### Mathematical Formulation of the Solution

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Reactor design equations are always needed for a reactor analysis. Here I don't need to generate the reactor design equations because the example narrative provides the three reactor design equations, (1) through (3). They contain a single independent variable, $z$, and three dependent variables, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$. The number of IVODEs equals the number of dependent variables, so they can be solved. In addition, the design equations were provided in the form of differential expressions and can be used in that form.

:::

**Reactor Design Equations**: 

The reactor design equations are presented in equations (1) through (3).

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Before the IVODEs can be solved, any unknown constants appearing in them must be calculated and any variables other than the independent variables must be eliminated from them.

There aren't any unknown constants in the IVODEs. The only variable in equations (1), (2), and (3) that needs to be eliminated is the rate, $r$. The example provides the ancillary equation, (4), that is needed to do so.

:::

**Ancillary Equation for Calculating the Derivatives**

The rate, $r$, appearing in the IVODEs is given by equation (4).

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

The initial and final values must also be known or calculated before the IVODEs can be solved. The inlet to the PFR can be defined as $z=0$, in which the other initial values are the molar flow rates at the reactor inlet and the temperature at the inlet. The example narrative gives the length of the reactor, so the stopping criterion is that $z=L$.

:::

**Intial Values and Stopping Criterion**

The initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations (1) through (3) are listed in @tbl-example_J_6_2_initial_values.

| Variable | Initial Value | Stopping Criterion |
|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| $z$ | $0$ | $L$ |
| $\dot{n}_A$ | $\dot{n}_{A,in}$ | |
| $\dot{n}_Z$ | $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$ | |
| $T$ | $T_{in}$ | |
  
: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the IVODEs, equations (1) through (3). {#tbl-example_J_6_2_initial_values}

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

In order to solve the IVODEs, the initial and final values must be calculated. Comparing @tbl-example_J_6_2_initial_values and the given and known constants it can be seen that $L$, $\dot{n}_{A,in}$, and $\dot{n}_{Z,in}$ are known, but $T_{in}$ is unknown and must be calculated. 

$T_{in}$ cannot be calculated directly from any of the given and known constants. However, a second final value, the outlet temperature, $T_{out}$, is given. Using that second final value I can write an implicit equation that can be solved to find $T_{in}$ as described in @sec-math_form_ivodes.

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values**

The initial value, $T_{in}$, can be calculated by noting that it is the value that results in the final temperature being equal to $T_{out}$, as expressed in equation (5), where $T\big\vert_{z=L}$ is the final temperature found by solving the IVODEs. An implicit equation for calculating $T_{in}$ can be written in the form of a residual, $\epsilon$ as shown in equation (6). That is, $T_{in}$ is the inlet temperature that causes $\epsilon$ to equal zero.

$$
T_{in} : T\big\vert_{z=L} = T_{out} \tag{5}
$$

$$
0 = T\big\vert_{z=L} - T_{out} = \epsilon \tag{6}
$$

With the information given above, equations (1), (2), (3), and (5) can be solved to find $T_{in}$, $\dot{n}_A\left(z\right)$, $\dot{n}_Z\left(z\right)$, and $T\left(z\right)$.

**Calculations Summary**

1. Substitute the given and known constants into all equations.
2. To calculate $r$ knowing $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$, use equation (4).
3. To evaluate the derivatives knowing $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Z$, $T$ and $r$ use equations (1), (2), and (3).
4. To evaluate $\epsilon$ knowing $T_{in}$, $\dot{n}_A\left(z\right)$, $\dot{n}_Z\left(z\right)$, and $T\left(z\right)$ use equation (6).

#### Numerical Implementation of the Solution

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

The general procedure for numerical implementation of the solution of a set of IVODEs presented in @sec-num_impl_ivodes can be used here.

:::

1. Make the given and known constants available for use in all functions,
2. Define a variable representing $T_{in}$ and make it available to all functions. 
3. Write a derivatives function that
    a. receives $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ as arguments,
    b. calculates $r$ as described in step 2 of the calculations summary, and
    c. evaluates and returns the derivatives as described in step 3 of the calculations summary.
4. Write a reactor model function that
    a. calls an IVODE solver using the following arguments
        i. the initial values (using the current value of $T_{in}$) and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_J_6_2_initial_values and
        ii. the name of the derivatives function from step 3,
    b. checks that the solver successfully solved the IVODEs, and
    c. returns sets of corresponding values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ spanning the range from their initial values to their final values.
5. Write a residuals function that
    a. receives a guess for $T_{in}$ and sets the current value of $T_{in}$ equal to the guess.
    b. calls the reactor model function from step 4 to get $\dot{n}_A\left(z\right)$, $\dot{n}_Z\left(z\right)$, and $T\left(z\right)$
    c. calculates and returns $\epsilon$ as described in step 4 of the calculations summary.
6. perform the analysis by
    a. calculating $T_{in}$ by calling an ATE solver using the following arguments
        i. an initial guess for $T_{in}$ and
        ii. the neme of the residuals function from step 5,
    b. setting the current value of $T_{in}$ equal to the result from step 6a, and
    c. calling the reactor model function from step 4 to get sets of corresponding values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ that span the range from their initial values to their final values.



When the ATE solver is called in step 6, it will generate guesses for $T_{in}$ as described in @sec-apndx_solve_ates. Each time it generates a new guess and passes it to the residuals, the current value of $T_{in}$ is set equal to that guess. Thus, when the reactor model function solves the reactor design equation in step 5b and evaluates $\epsilon$, it uses the current guess for $T_{in}$. When the implicit equation for $T_{in}$ is solved, the current value of $T_{in}$ is set to the result in step 6b, which then will be used to solve the reactor design equations in step 6c.

#### Results and Discussion

The calculations were performed as described above. The required inlet temperature, $T_{in}$, is `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`.  Using that initial value and solving the IVODEs yields the results shown in @tbl-example_J_6_2_ivode_results

```

When `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]` was used as the initial value of the temperature, @tbl-example_J_6_2_ivode_results shows that the outlet temperature did, indeed, equal 400 K at $L$ = 100 in. That table additionally shows that the initial values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$ and $\dot{n}_Z$, and the final value of $z$ all have their specified values. Thus the results are consistent.

I will begin by summarizing the assignment. In this example, variable symbols have already been assigned to most of the known constant. Since this is a flow system, I'll use a subscripted "in" is used to denote initial (inlet) values (at $z=0$) and a subscripted "out" for final (outlet) values.

## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

Normally at this point I would need to determine which of the reactor design equations are needed to model the reactor, simplify them, and make sure that the number of IVODEs is equal to the number of dependent variables. Here, however, the reactor design equations, (1) through (3), are given to me in simplified form and the number of equations equals the number of dependent variables. The independent variable is $z$, and the dependent variables are $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Z$ and $T$.

Knowing that to solve the IVODEs, I'll need to calculate the values of the derivatives, I'd next write the reactor design equations in the form of derivative expressions, but that has already been done here, too.

**Reactor Design Equations**

Equations (1), (2), and (3) are the reactor design equations.

In order to calculate the values of the derivatives, any unknown constants appearing in them and any variables other than the independent and dependent variables must first be calculated. In this example, the rate, $r$, is the only variable that needs to be calculated, and the example provides the ancillary equation, (4), needed to eliminate it.

The unknown, constant value of $\dot{V}$ also appears in the IVODEs, and it must be calculated too. To do that I will use the final value of $T$, $T_{out}$, that is specified in the assignment to write an implicit equation that can be solved to find $\dot{V}$ (see @sec-math_form_ivodes). Knowing that I will be solving that equation numerically, I'll write it in the form of a residual (see @sec-apndx_solve_ates).

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Derivatives**

The rate, $r$ appearing in the design equations is given by equation (4). The volumetric flow rate can be calculated using equation (5) where $\epsilon$ is a function of $\dot{V}$. Equation (5) can be solved for $\dot{V}$ using an ATE solver.

$$
\dot{V} : T\big\vert_{z=0} = T_{out} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 0 = T\big\vert_{z=0} - T_{out} = \epsilon \tag{5}
$$

The inlet to the reactor can be defined as $z=0$, in which case the initial values of the dependent variables are just their values at the reactor inlet. The assignment provides two final values: $z=L$ and $T=T_{out}$. The latter was used to write equation (5), so the former will be used as the stopping criterion.

:::

**Intial Values and Stopping Criterion**

The initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations (1) through (3) are listed in @tbl-example_J_6_3_initial_values.

Before the IVODEs can be solved, the initial and final values must be calculated. Looking at @tbl-example_J_6_3_initial_values, the inlet temperature and the length of the reactor are known constants, but the inlet molar flow rates of A and Z, $n_{A,in}$ and $n_{Z,in}$, must be calculated. The inlet concentrations are known, so the definiting equation for concentration in a flow reactor can be used to calculate the inlet molar flow rates. Of course, the volumetric flow rate will need to be calculated first.

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values**

The inlet molar flow rates in @tbl-example_J_6_3_initial_values can be calculated using equations (6) and (7).

$$
\dot{n}_{A,in} = \dot{V} C_{A,in} \tag{6}

I have now written all of the equations that are needed to to calculate $\dot{V}$ and solve the IVODEs. To complete the mathematical formulation of the solution, I'll describe how to use the equations I've written.

:::

With the information provided above, equations (1), (2), (3), and (5) can be solved to find the missing constant, $\dot{V}$, and $\dot{n}_A\left(z\right)$, $\dot{n}_Z\left(z\right)$, and $T\left(z\right)$. To do so numerically it will be necessary to calculate the following items using the indicated information.

**Calculations**

* To calculate the **values of the derivatives** using the given and known constants and the independent and dependent variables
    1. Calculate $r$ using equation (4)
    2. Calculate the values of the derivatives using equations (1), (2), and (3).
* To calculate all but the missing **initial and final values** in @tbl-example_J_6_3_initial_values using the given and known constants
    1. Solve equation (5) for $\dot{V}$ using an ATE solver.
    2. Calculate $n_{A,in}$ and $n_{Z,in}$ using equations (6) and (7)
* To calculate the **residual** corresponding to $\dot{V}$ using the given and known constants and a solution of the reactor design equations
    1. Extract the final value of $T$, $T\big\vert_{z=L}$ from the solution of the reactor design equations.
    2. Calculate $\epsilon$ using equation (5).

#### Numerical Implementation of the Solution

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}

## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

There is a missing constant, $\dot{V}$, in the IVODEs complicates the numerical implementation slightly. The procedure is described in @sec-num_impl_ivodes. It involves solving both ATEs, as described in @sec-apndx_numeric_implem_ates, and IVODEs, as described in @sec-num_impl_ivodes.

:::

**Implementation Procedure**

Write computer code to perform the analysis. Within that code

1. make the given and known constants available for use in all equations,
2. define a variable representing the current value of $\dot{V}$ and make it available to all functions,
3. write a derivatives function that uses the current value of $\dot{V}$ and calculates the derivatives as described under the Calculations heading above,
4. write a reactor model function that uses the current value of $\dot{V}$ to solve the reactor design equations by 
    a. calculating the initial and final values as described under the Calculations heading above,
    b. setting the initial values and stopping criterion as indicated in @tbl-example_J_6_3_initial_values
    c. callling an IVODE solver, passing the derivatives function (step 3) and the initial values and stopping criterion (step 4b) to it as arguments,
5. write a residuals function that calculates the residual by
    a. receiving a guess for $\dot{V}$
    b. setting the current value of $\dot{V}$ equal to the guess
    c. solving the reactor design equations by calling the reactor model function (step 4)
    d. calculating the residual as described under the Calculations heading above
6. perform the analysis by
    a. setting an initial guess for $\dot{V}$.
    b. calculating $\dot{V}$ by calling an ATE solver passing the initial guess (step 6a) and the residuals function (step 5) as arguments.
    c. solving the reactor design equations by calling the reactor model function (step 4).

As was the case in @sec-example_J_6_3, the key feature of the numerical implementation is creating a variable to hold the current value of $\dot{V}$ and making it available throughout the code. By doing so, each time the ATE solver tests a guess it has generated, the IVODEs are solved using that guess. Then, once $\dot{V}$ has been found, the IVODEs are solved using the result.

| $\underline y$ | Column vector formed from the dependent variables in a set of ODEs. |
| $z$ | axial position measured from the reactor inlet. |
| $\hat C_{p,i}$ | Molar heat capacity of reagent $i$. |
| $\boldsymbol{M}$ | Matrix of coefficients that multiplies a column vector of derivatives when the ODEs are written using a matrix. |
| $N$ | Number of IVODEs in the set. |
| $P$ | Pressure. |
| $R$ | Ideal gas constant. |
| $T$ | Temperature; a subscripted $in$ denotes the *inlet* temperature. |
| $V$ | Volume of fluid. |
| $\epsilon$ | Residual corresponding to the implicit equation for calculating a missing initial value of IVODE constant. |
| $\Delta x$ | Change in the value of the independent variable. |
| $\Delta y$ | Change in the value of the dependent variable. |
| $\Delta H$ | Heat of reaction. |
