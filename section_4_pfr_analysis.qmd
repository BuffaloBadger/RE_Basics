This chapter includes six examples involving the analysis of an isolated PFR. The first three examples illustrate response tasks involving steady-state PFRs. [Example -@sec-example_13_7_1] involves a gas phase reaction with negligible pressure drop while in [Example -@sec-example_13_7_3] the momentum balance is used. In [Example -@sec-example_13_7_2] the required feed temperature for a liquid-phase reaction is calculated. [Example -@sec-example_13_7_4] illustrates an optimization task for a gas-phase reaction with negligible pressure drop. [Example -@sec-example_13_7_5] analyzes the start-up of the PFR from [Example -@sec-example_13_7_2] where the transient takes the form of a front that propgates along the length of the reactor. A packed-bed PFR with concentration gradients within the catalyst pores is considered in [Example -@sec-example_13_7_6].

This assignment describes an isolated PFR and the manner in which it operates and asks questions about the reactor outputs. For analysis purposes, it isn't part of a larger system, so I will need to create a model for the reactor and use it to answer the questions. I'll summarize the assignment by assigning an appropriate variable symbol to each quantity provided in the narrative. I'll use a subscripted "in" to denote quantities that apply at the inlet to the reactor.

#### Mathematical Formulation of the Solution

I need to generate the reactor design equations needed to model this PFR as discussed in @sec-3_design_eqns. Mole balances are always included among the reactor design equations. I will write mole balances on each of the reagents in the system, A, B, and Z. The PFR operates at steady-state, so I'll start with the general steady-state PFR given in @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance. There is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term. 

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\cancelto{\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j}
$$

This reactor is not isothermal, so the mole balances must be solved simultaneously with an energy balance on the reacting gas. To generate that equation, I'll start from the general form of the steady-state PFR energy balance, @eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance. There are three reagents present in the reactor, so the first summation expands to three terms. Again, there is only one reaction taking place, so the final summation reduces to a single term. Knowing that I will be solving the design equations numerically, I'll rearrange the equation into the form of a derivative expression.

$$
\cancelto{\left( \dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_B \hat{C}_{p,B} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z}  \right)}{\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)} \frac{d T}{d z} = \pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\cancelto{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j}
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = \frac{\pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \Delta H_1}{\dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_B \hat{C}_{p,B} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z}}
$$

The PFR is being heated using the latent heat of a heat exchange fluid. Because only the latent heat is involved, the temperature of the exchange fluid is constant. That means that I can solve the other mole and energy balances independently of an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid. (In this assignment I'm not provide with sufficient information to write the exchange fluid energy balance, but neither does the assignment ask for anything that would need to be calculated using it.)

Finally, for PFRs a momentum balance is needed to account for pressure drop along the length of the reactor. In this assignment, however, it is noted that pressure drop is negligible, so a momentum balance is not needed.

:::

**Reactor Design Equations**

Mole balance design equations for A, B, and Z are presented in equations (3) - (5). The energy balance on the reacting gas is given in equation (6).

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_A}{dz} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_B}{dz} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{5}
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = \frac{\pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \Delta H_1}{\left( \dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_B \hat{C}_{p,B} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z} \right)} \tag{6}
$$

The reactor design equations consist of four IVODEs and they contain four dependent variables, so there isn't a need to either eliminate a dependent variable or add an IVODE. However, in order to solve the design equations numerically, initial values and a stopping criterion are needed.

I can define $z=0$ to be the inlet to the reactor. The initial values are then simply the values of the depedent variables at the reactor inlet. The length of the reactor is provided, so that can serve as the stopping criterion.

**Initial Values and Stopping Criterion**

|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| $z$ | $0$ | $L$ |
| $\dot{n}_A$ | $\dot{n}_{A,in}$ | |
| $\dot{n}_B$ | $\dot{n}_{B,in}$ | |
| $\dot{n}_Z$ | $0$ | |

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically I'll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_1_initial_values.

I'll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent ($z$) and dependent ($\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$) variables will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions, equations (3) through (6).

Looking at those equations I see that I'll need to calculate the rate, $r_1$. I can use the rate expression, equation (2), to do that, but that wiill require me to calculate the rate coefficient, $k_1$, and the partial pressures of A and B. The Arrhenius expression, @eq-arrhenius, can be used for the former and the defining equation for partial pressure for the latter.

$$
P_i = y_iP = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\sum_i\dot{n}_i}
$$

k_1 = k_{0,1} \exp{\left( \frac{-E_1}{RT} \right)} \tag{7}

When I solve the IVODEs numerically, I'll also need to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_1_initial_values. The reactor length and feed temperature are given in the assignment narrative. The narrative also provides the inlet mole fractions of A and B and the inlet volumetric flow rate. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate the total inlet molar flow rate which can be multiplied by each reagent mole fraction to calculate the inlet molar flow of that reagent.

$$
\dot{n}_{i,in} = y_{i,in} \dot{n}_{total,in} =  y_{i,in} \frac{P\dot{V}_{in}}{RT_{in}}

At this point the reactor design equations can be solved to get corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ spanning the range from their initial (inlet) values to their final (outlte) values. The outlet temperature is one of the quantities of interest. The other, namely the fractional conversion of B can be calculated using its defining equation for an open system, @eq-conversion_def_open.

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest**

Solving the reactor design equations yields $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ as functions of $z$ between 0 and $L$. The conversion of B can be calculated using equation (12).

$$
f_B = \frac{\dot{n}_{B,in} - \dot{n}_B}{\dot{n}_{B,in}}\tag{12}
$$

The calculations were performed as described above. The outlet temperature is `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]` and the conversion of B is `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`. Apparently the rate of heat transfer to the reactor from the vapor condensing on the outside of the reactor wall is less than the heat absorbed by the endothermic reaction. The feed enters at 175 °C, and despite the heat being supplied by the 200 °C heat exchange fluid, the reacting fluid temperature drops to `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]` by the time it reaches the reactor outlet.

As the temperature drops, the reaction rate decreases. If heat was not being supplied, the temperature would have dropped even lower resulting in a lower conversion at the reactor outlet.
