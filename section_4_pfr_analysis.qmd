# PFR Analysis {#sec-4_pfr_analysis}

The reactors examined in preceding chapters were all variants of a stirred tank, that is, they were perfectly mixed. This chapter considers a very different kind of continuous reactor, namely the plug flow reactor (PFR). PFRs are basically tubes through which reacting fluid flows and within which chemical reactions take place.

![Simple schematic representation of a PFR.](Graphics/pfr_schematic.png){#fig-pfr_schematic width="75%"}

## PFR Characteristics

The distincitve characteristics of PFRs were summarized in @sec-3_design_eqns, and they are presented in more detail in @sec-apndx_ideal_reactor_models. The biggest difference between PFRs and stirred tanks lies in the mixing. Stirred tanks are perfectly mixed at all times, so there are never any spatial variations of composition or temperature within the reactor. In contrast, the composition and temperature vary continuously along the length of a PFR as the reacting fluid flows through it. More specifically, as illustrated in @fig-pfr-vol-element, it is assumed that the fluid velocity in the axial distance does not vary in the radial direction. As a consequence, the fluid can be thought of as differentially thick disks that move from the reactor inlet to the outlet. There is perfect mixing in the radial direction (i. e. within each differentially thick disk) an no mixing at all in the axial direction.

Another difference between PFRs and CSTRs is that the pressure of the reacting fluid can decrease as the fluid flows from the inlet to the outlet. When analyzing CSTRs it is assumed that pressure changes are negligible both between inlet and outlet and between the top and bottom of the fluid within the reactor.

In PFRs, heat is exchanged through the reactor walls. Commonly there is a concentric tube surrounding the reactor tube with heat exchange fluid flowing through the annular space. Alternatively, there may be many reactor tubes that all pass through a larger shell while heat exchange fluid flows through the shell. In some applications PFR tubes pass though a firebox within which some fuel is burned. In this situation the flue gases are the heat exchange fluid, and any PFR tubes that are within line of sight of the combustion flame are additionally heated radiantly. *Reaction Engineering Basics* only considers heat exchange with a fliud in a shell surrounding the PFR tube (see @sec-3_design_eqns).

Being continuous flow reactors, PFRs can operate at steady-state or in a transient mode. At the minimum, transient operation occurs when the PFR is started up and shut down. Transient behavior will occur whenever a reactor input changes. Those changes can involve the flow rate, the feed composition, the feed temperature, the feed pressure, the heat exchange fluid flow rate, and the heat exchange fluid inlet temperature. Due to the nature of plug flow, PFR transients typically only last as long as it takes the reacting fluid to flow from the reactor inlet to its outlet.

PFRs are well-suited to high throughput production. They can also be used for reactions that require solid catalyst particles. The absence of axial mixing can be an advantage because, unlike a CSTR, the reactants are not immediately diluted due to mixing with the fluid already present in the reactor. As a consequence, the concentration of reactant is high at the inlet. High reactant concentration typically results in a high reaction rate and a smaller reactor volume.

The absence of axial mixing can also be a disadvantage if the reaction is exothermic with limited or no heat removal. Unlike a CSTR, where the feed is instantly heated to the outlet temperature upon entering the reactor, fluid enters a PFR at the feed temperature, and its temperature rises continuously as it flows through the reactor. The lower temperatures near the inlet typically result in a lower rate and therefore a larger reactor is needed to accomplish a given extent of conversion.

Another disadvangage of PFRs is the fixed heat transfer area. As noted, heat exchange with a PFR is typically limited to occur through the reactor wall. Unlike CSTRs, it isn' feasible to add coiled tubes containing flowing heat exchange fluid within the PFR tube. Similarly, circulating the reacting fluid through an external heat exchanger is not practical. In some situations it is possible to break one long PFR into several shorter PFRs with additional cooling between the shorter lengths of reactor.

## PFR Operation

Like CSTRs, PFRs are normally designed to operate at steady state. When a PFR operates at steady state, the composition, temperature and pressure are all constant over time at any one axial position in the reactor. The temperature pressure and composition will be different at a different location, but at that location they again will be constant over time. Put differently, the steady-state composition, pressure and temperature in a PFR will vary spatitially, but not temporally.

PFRs must operate in transient modes when they are started up and shut down, and they will also undergo transient operation if any reactor input changes. The absence of axial mixing can result in "odd" transients that intuitively seem to be incorrect. This aspect of transient PFR operation is discussed later in the chapter.

## Qualitative Analysis of Steady-State Reaction in a PFR

@sec-4_cstr_analysis pointed out that in a continuous reactor, the amount of time during which reaction occurs is equal to the amount of time that the fluid spends in the reactor. As a consequence, when qualitatively analyzing the performance of a continuous reactor, the effects of small changes in space time are considered. When that is done, the qualitative analysis of a PFR is essentially the same as a BSTR except that the space time is used instead of elapsed clock time.

Indeed, there is a relationship between BSTR reaction time and PFR space time. As already noted, each differential, disk-shaped element of fluid that enters a PFR flows through the reactor without mixing with the fluid that entered before it or the fluid that enters after it. Furthermore, being differentially thin and with perfect radial mixing in a PFR, that thin disk is essentially a small batch reactor that moves from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet, as illustrated in @fig-pfr_bstr_analogy. From the perspective of that thin disk, the reaction time is equal to the time it takes to flow from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet.

![Analogy between reaction time in a BSTR and space time in a PFR.](Graphics/pfr_bstr_analogy.png){#fig-pfr_bstr_analogy width="40%"}

For incompressible liquid phase systems, the analogy of @fig-pfr_bstr_analogy is exact. For gases, the volume of the thin disk may change as it moves through the reactor due to changes in temperature, pressure or total moles. The space time is defined in terms of the inlet volumetric flow rate, so it does not account for expansion or contraction of the thin disk. Nonetheless, for the purposes of a qualitative analysis the expansion effect is not important.

@sec-bstr_qualitative_analysis presented an approach to qualitative analysis of a BSTR wherein the effects of small increments in reaction time were assessed. The same procedure can be used for PFR, substituting the space time for the reaction time. Basically the changes experienced as a function of reaction time in a BSTR are the same as the changes experienced upon progressing from a PFR's inlet to its outlet.

## PFR Design Equations

The reactor design equations for PFRs and their simplification were presented in @sec-3_design_eqns. The PFR reactor design equations are derived in @sec-apndx_ideal_reactor_models. The general PFR mole balance, @eq-pfr_mol_balance, energy balance, @eq-pfr_energy_balance, and momentum balance, @eq-pfr_transient_momentum_balance, are reproduced below, along with energy balances on a perfectly mixed heat exchange fluid that exchanges sensible heat, @eq-exchange_energy_bal_sensible, or latent heat, @eq-exchange_energy_bal_latent, with the reacting fluid.

$$
\frac{\partial \dot{n}_i}{\partial z} + \frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot{V}} \frac{\partial\dot{n}_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2\dot{n}_i}{4\dot{V}^2} \frac{\partial \dot{V}}{\partial t}  =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
\begin{split}
\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} +& \frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot{V}} \sum_i \left(\dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} \\ &= \pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
\end{split}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \dot{V}}{\partial t} + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial \dot{V}}{\partial z} + \frac{\pi D^2}{4 \rho} \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} = - \frac{2 f \dot{V}^2}{\pi D^3}
$$

$$
\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \tilde{C}_{p,ex}\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\dot{Q} - \dot{m}_{ex} \int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \tilde{C}_{p,ex}dT
$$

$$
\frac{\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \Delta H_{\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \frac{d \gamma}{dt} = - \dot{Q} - \gamma \dot{m}_{ex} \frac{\Delta H_{\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}
$$

The transient PFR design equations above are parital differential equations. They are presented here for completeness. Transient analysis of PFRs is not presented in *Reaction Engineering Basics* except for the special case, discussed later in the chapter, where a front propagates through the reactor.

When a PRF is operating at steady state, the time derivatives are equal to zero and the partial derivatives become ordinary derivatives. The general form of the *steady-state* PFR mole balance, @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance, energy balance, @eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance, momentum balance, @eq-pfr_momentum_balance, and packed bed momentum balance, @eq-pfr_ergun_eqn, are reproduced here.
 
$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{d T}{d z} = \pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$
 
$$
\frac{dP}{dz} = - \frac{4G}{\pi D^2} \frac{d \dot{V}}{dz} - \frac{fG^2}{2D \rho}
$$

$$
\frac{{dP}}{{dz}} =  - \frac{{1 - \varepsilon }}{{{\varepsilon ^3}}}\frac{{{G^2}}}{{\rho {\Phi _s}{D_p}}}\left[ {\frac{{150\left( {1 - \varepsilon } \right)\mu }}{{{\Phi _s}{D_p}G}} + 1.75} \right]
$$

Some of the PFR reactor design equations contain more than one dependent variable. As a consequence it is sometimes necessary to add a differential equation or eliminate a dependent variable in order to solve the design equations. Differential forms of the ideal gas law, @eq-partial_dif_gas_law and @eq-dif_gas_law_wrt_z, can be used to do this.

$$
P \frac{\partial \dot{V}}{\partial t} + \dot{V} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - R \left( T \sum_i \frac{\partial \dot{n}_i}{\partial t} + \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i \right) \frac{\partial T}{ \partial t} \right) = 0
$$ {#eq-partial_dif_gas_law}

$$
P \frac{d \dot{V}}{dz} + \dot{V} \frac{dP}{dz} - R \left( T \sum_i \frac{d\dot{n}_i}{dz} + \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i \right) \frac{dT}{dz} \right) = 0
$$ {#eq-dif_gas_law_wrt_z}

The sensible heat terms in the PFR energy balances above are written in terms of the molar heat capacities of the reagents. Those terms can also be expressed in terms of the overall volumetric or gravimetric heat capacity of the reacting fluid.

$$
\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \Leftrightarrow \rho \dot{V} \tilde{C}_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \Leftrightarrow \dot{V} \breve{C}_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}
$$ {#eq-equiv_sens_terms_pfr}

$$
\frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot{V}} \sum_i \left(\dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \Leftrightarrow \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\rho  \tilde{C}_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} \Leftrightarrow \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \breve{C}_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
$$ {#eq-equiv_sens_terms_pfr_time}

If the reacting fluid is an incompressible, ideal liquid mixture, the volumetric flow rate will be constant. Consequently its derivative with respect to either time or axial position will equal zero. The total heat transferred from the exchange fluid to the reacting fluid is given by @eq-total_heat_exchanged_pfr.

$$
\dot{Q} = \int_0^L \pi D U \left(T_{ex} - T \right)dz
$$ {#eq-total_heat_exchanged_pfr}

When rate expressions are substituted into the PFR design equations, they will introduce concentrations or, for gases, partial pressures. For liquid phase reactions, the concentration can be expressed in terms of the dependent variables in the design equations using its defining equation. For gases the concentration or partial pressure can be expressed in terms of the molar amounts using the ideal gas law.

$$
C_i = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\dot{V}}
$$

$$
C_i = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\sum_i \left(\dot{n}_i\right)}\frac{P}{RT} \qquad i = \text{ ideal gas}
$$

$$
P_i = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\sum_i \left(\dot{n}_i\right)}P \qquad i = \text{ ideal gas}
$$

## PFR Reaction Fronts

According to the ideal PFR model fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial direction, but it does not mix at all in the axial direction. Furthermore, the velocity in the axial direction does not vary across the reactor tube. Figures [-@fig-pfr-vol-element] and [-@fig-pfr_bstr_analogy] show that with these assumptions the fluid flow through the reactor can be envisioned as differentially thick disks that move through the reactor one after the other. These disks never mix with the disk ahead of them or with the disk behind them.

Under certain conditions, these assumptions can result in transient behavior where a "front" moves through the reactor. Specifically if the feed temperature or the feed composition (but **not** the feed flow rate) changes abruptly, none of the fluid alread in the reactor is affected. This is illustrated in @fig-transient_front for the situation where there isn't any reaction taking place within the reactor.

![Development of a front in a PFR following an abrupt change in the feed temperature or composition. Gray shading indicates fluid with the temperature and composition prior to the feed change and turquoise indicates fluid with the temperature and composition after the feed change.](Graphics/stages_of_a_transient_front.png){#fig-transient_front width="70%"}

The figure indicates that there is an abrupt change, i. e. a step-change, in the feed temperature and/or composition that starts the transient response. Notice the sharp interface between the fluid that entered just before the change and the fluid entering to start the transient. That interface is called a "front". As a result of the plug flow within the reactor, a short while later that front has moved part way through the reactor. It remains as sharp as it was at the instant the change occurred because the fluid just ahead of the front never mixes with the fluid at the beginning of the front.

The transient response of the reactor only lasts as long as it takes for the fluid to flow from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet. If the fluid is incompressible, the linear velocity of the front is equal to the volumetric flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the tube, @eq-pfr_front_velocity. The position of the front is then equal to the elapsed time since the front began times the velocity, @eq-pfr_front_position. The duration of the front is then equal to the time at which the front reaches the reactor outlet at $z=L$, which is equal to the PFR space time, @eq-pfr_transient_duration. Equations [-@eq-pfr_front_velocity], [-@eq-pfr_front_position], and [-@eq-pfr_transient_duration] only apply for an incompressible fluid.

$$
v_{front} = \frac{\dot{V}}{\frac{\pi D^2}{4}} = \frac{4\dot{V}}{\pi D^2}
$$ {#eq-pfr_front_velocity}

$$
z_{front} = v_{front} t = \frac{4\dot{V}t}{\pi D^2}
$$ {#eq-pfr_front_position}

$$
L = \frac{4\dot{V}t_{transient}}{\pi D^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t_{transient} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\frac{L}{\dot{V}} = \frac{V_{PFR}}{\dot{V}} = \tau_{PFR}
$$ {#eq-pfr_transient_duration}

The preceding discussion and @fig-transient_front assumed that no reaction was taking place when the step-change was applied to the feed composition and/or temperature. However, the same reasoning applies if reaction is taking place. The fluid ahead of the front is unaffected by the change in the feed, and similarly, the fluid behind the front is unaffected by the downstream presence of the front. In other words, **the composition profile during this type of transient can be calculated using the steady-state PFR design equations**.

When a step change in the composition and/or temperature occurs at the inlet to a steady-state PFR, a front will propagate along the length of the reactor. The concentration and temperature profile between the reactor inlet and the front is the steady-state profile for the new feed. The concentration and temperature profile between the front and the reactor outlet is the steady-state profile that existed before the feed change. Example [-@sec-example_13_7_5] illustrates the propagation of this type of front. 

It is important to understand that this approach only applies when the step change in the feed does not affect the fluid already in the reactor. If the feed flow rate changed, or if the exchange fluid flow rate or inlet temperature changed, a front like that described above would not result and this type of analysis would not be valid.

This chapter includes six examples of the analysis of an isolated PFR. The first three examples illustrate response tasks involving steady-state PFRs. A gas-phase reaction with negligible pressure drop is considered in [Example -@sec-example_13_7_1], and a liquid-phase system in [Example -@sec-example_13_7_2]. In the former example, the reactor design equations are solved to find the PFR output, while in the latter they are solved to find the feed temperature in addition to the reactor output. [Example -@sec-example_13_7_3] examines a gas-phase, packed-bed PFR where a momentum balance is used to account for pressure drop. [Example -@sec-example_13_7_4] illustrates an optimization task for a gas-phase reaction with negligible pressure drop. [Example -@sec-example_13_7_5] analyzes the start-up of the PFR from [Example -@sec-example_13_7_2] where the transient takes the form of a front that propgates along the length of the reactor. Finally, a packed-bed PFR with concentration gradients within the catalyst pores is considered in [Example -@sec-example_13_7_6].

This assignment describes an isolated PFR and the manner in which it operates and asks questions about the reactor outputs. I will need to create a model for the reactor and use it to answer the questions. I'll first summarize the assignment by assigning an appropriate variable symbol to each quantity provided in the narrative. I'll use a subscripted "in" to denote values at the inlet to the reactor, a subscripted "out" to denote values at the reactor outlet, and I'll add values for the ideal gas constant since I know I'll need them. The assignment explicitly asks for the *steady-state* values of the quantities of interest, and from reading the assignment, I see that the PFR is neither isothermal nor adiabatic, but instead it is heated.

#### Mathematical Formulation of the Solution

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

I need to generate the reactor design equations for modeling this particular PFR as discussed in @sec-3_design_eqns. The minimum number of mole balances is equal to the number of mathematically independent reactions plus one mole balance per inert species. Since I'm going to solve them numerically, it's just as easy to write a mole balance on every reagent in the system (A, B, and Z in this assignment). The PFR operates at steady-state, so I'll start with the general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance given in @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance. There is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term. 

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\cancelto{\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j}
$$

This reactor is not isothermal, so the mole balances cannot be solved separately from an energy balance on the reacting gas. To generate that equation, I'll start from the general form of the steady-state PFR energy balance, @eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance. There are three reagents present in the reactor, so the first summation expands to three terms. Again, there is only one reaction taking place, so the final summation reduces to a single term. Knowing that I will be solving the design equations numerically, and that I'll have to evaluate each of the derivatives, I'll rearrange the equation into the form of a derivative expression (@sec-apndx_solve_ivodes).

$$
\cancelto{\left( \dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_B \hat{C}_{p,B} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z}  \right)}{\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)} \frac{d T}{d z} = \pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\cancelto{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j}
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = \frac{\pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \Delta H_1}{\dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_B \hat{C}_{p,B} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z}}
$$

The PFR is being heated using the latent heat of a heat exchange fluid. Because only the latent heat is involved, the temperature of the exchange fluid is constant. That means that I can solve the combined mole and reacting fluid energy balances independently of an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid. (In this assignment I'm not provide with sufficient information to solve the exchange fluid energy balance, but neither does the assignment ask for anything that would need to be calculated using it.)

Finally, for PFRs a momentum balance is needed to account for pressure drop along the length of the reactor. In this assignment, however, it is noted that pressure drop is negligible, so I won't add a momentum balance to the reactor design equations.

:::

**Reactor Design Equations**

Mole balance design equations for A, B, and Z are presented in equations (3) - (5). The energy balance on the reacting gas is given in equation (6).

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_A}{dz} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_B}{dz} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{5}
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = \frac{\pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \Delta H_1}{\left( \dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_B \hat{C}_{p,B} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z} \right)} \tag{6}

The reactor design equations consist of four IVODEs and they contain four dependent variables, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$, so there isn't a need to either eliminate a dependent variable or add an IVODE. However, in order to solve the design equations numerically, initial values and a stopping criterion are needed.

I can define $z=0$ to be the inlet to the reactor. The other initial values are then simply the values of the depedent variables at the reactor inlet. The length of the reactor is provided, so that can serve as the stopping criterion.

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically I'll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_1_initial_values.

At the start of each integration step, the independent variable ($z$) and the dependent variables ($\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$) will be known, as will the given and known constants listed above. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions, equations (3) through (6).

Looking at those equations I see that I'll need to calculate the rate, $r_1$. I can use the rate expression, equation (2), to do that, but that wiill require me to calculate the rate coefficient, $k_1$, and the partial pressures of A and B. The Arrhenius expression, @eq-arrhenius, can be used for the former and a defining equation for partial pressure for the latter.

When I solve the IVODEs numerically, I'll also need to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_1_initial_values. The reactor length and feed temperature are given in the assignment narrative. The narrative also provides the inlet mole fractions of A and B and the inlet volumetric flow rate. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate the total inlet molar flow rate which can be multiplied by each reagent mole fraction to calculate the inlet molar flow of that reagent.

At this point the reactor design equations can be solved numerically to get corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ spanning the range from their initial (inlet) values to their final (outlet) values. The outlet temperature is one of the quantities of interest. The other, namely the fractional conversion of B can be calculated using its defining equation for an open system, @eq-conversion_def_open.

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest**

Solving the reactor design equations yields $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ as functions of $z$ between 0 and $L$. The outlet temperature and the conversion of B can be calculated using equations (12) and (13).

The calculations were performed as described above. The outlet temperature is `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]` and the conversion of B is `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`. Apparently the rate of heat transfer to the reactor from the vapor condensing on the outside of the reactor wall is less than the heat absorbed by the endothermic reaction. The feed enters at 175 °C, and despite the heat being supplied by the 200 °C heat exchange fluid, the reacting fluid temperature drops to `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]` by the time it reaches the reactor outlet.

As the temperature drops, the reaction rate decreases. If heat was not being supplied, the temperature would have dropped even lower resulting in a lower conversion at the reactor outlet.

This assignment describes an isolated steady-state PFR and its operation, and it asks about reactor inputs and outputs. To begin, I'll summarize the assignment by assigning appropriate variable symbols to all of the quantities it mentions. I'll use a subscripted "in" to denote values that apply to the feed and a subscripted "out" to denote values that apply to the reactor outlet. I'll add the ideal gas constant to the list since I know I'll need it.

The assignment states that the reactor is perfectly insulated. That means that it does not exchange heat through its walls, i. e. it is adiabatic. The assignment does not explicitly state that it operates at steady-state, but there is no mention of a change in any of the reactor inputs anywhere in the narrative. If the reactor was operating in a transient mode, something would have had to change to initiate the transient. Since no such change is mentioned, I can safely assume steady-state operation.

In order to complete this assignment I will need to create a model of this PFR and use it to answer the questions posed. I need to generate the reactor design equations for this PFR in order to model it. The design equations always include mole balances. Knowing I'll be solving the design equations numerically, I'll just write a mole balance on every reagent present in the system. This reactor operates at steady-state, so the general form of the mole balance is given by @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance. There is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}r_1
$$

The reactor is not isothermal, so I cannot solve the mole balances independently. I need to add an energy balance on the reacting fluid. The general form of the steady-state PFR reacting fluid energy balance is given by @eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance. The narrative provides the gravimetric heat capacity and the density of the liquid phase reacting fluid, to the first term can be modified to use that information. This PFR is adiabatic, so the heat exchange term is equal to zero, and again, there is only one reaction taking place.

$$
\cancelto{\rho \dot{V} \breve{C}_p}{\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)} \frac{d T}{d z} = \cancelto{0}{\pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right)} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\cancelto{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j}
$$

When I solve the design equations numerically, I'm going to need to evaluate the derivatives, so I will re-write the equation in the form of a derivative expression (see @sec-apndx_solve_ivodes).

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\rho \dot{V} \tilde{C}_p}
$$

The reactor is adiabatic, so there isn't a heat exchange fluid to write an energy balance on. The pressure drop is negligible, so a momentum balance is not needed.

:::

**Reactor Design Equations**

Mole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z are presented in equations (3) through (6), and an energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (7).

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_A}{dz} = - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_B}{dz} = - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_Y}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{5}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{6}
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\rho \dot{V} \tilde{C}_p} \tag{7}
$$

There are five IVODE reactor design equations and they contain five dependent variables ($\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and %T%), so there isn't a need to eliminae a dependent variable or add an IVODE.

Initial values and a stopping criterion are needed when solving IVODEs numerically. I can define $z=0$ to be the inlet to the reactor, in which case the other initial values are the molar flow rates and the temperture at the reactor inlet. The feed only contains A and B, so the inlet molar flow rates of Y and Z are zero. The length of the reactor is given, so that can serve as the stopping criterion.

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Note

The assignment also specifies the conversion of A. As such, I could have used the final value of A $\left(\dot{n}_{A,out} = \dot{n}_{A,in}\left( 1 - f_A \right)\right)$ as the stopping criterion. In that case I'd  calculate $T_{in}$ below using an implicit equation that requires the reactor length to equal $L$ $\left(T_{in}: z_{out} = L\right)$.

In the solution presented here I am using $z=L$ as the stopping criterion and calculating $T_{in}$ below using an implicit equation requires the conversion to have the specified value $\left(T_{in}: f_{A} \big \vert_{z=L} = f_A\right)$.

Both approaches are valid and will produce the same results.

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically I'll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_2_initial_values. At the start of an integration step, the independent ($z$) and dependent variables ($\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$) will be known, as will the given and known constants listed above. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions, equations (3) - (7).

In those equations, the reaction rate, $r_1$, and the volumetric flow rate, $\dot{V}$, are unknown. The rate can be calculated using the rate expression, equation (2). In order to do that, the rate coefficient and the concentrations of A and B must be calculated. The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, @eq-arrhenius. The concentrations can be calculated using the defining equation for concentration in an open system, @eq-concentration_open. The reacting fluid is a liquid; assuming it to be an incompressible ideal mixture means that the volumetric flow rate will be constant and equal to the inlet volumetric flow rate.

When I solve the IVODEs numerically, I'll also need to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_2_initial_values. The reactor length, $L$, is provided in the assignment narrative, and the inlet molar flow rates of A and B can be calculated from their known inlet concentrations and the inlet volumetric flow rate, @eq-concentration_open.

The feed temperature, $T_{in}$, is not specified. Indeed, it is one of the quatntities of interest. Instead, however, a second outlet value, namely the conversion, is provided. The inlet temperature must result in a conversion, $f_A \big \vert_{z=L}$, equal to the specified conversion, $f_A$, listed among the given and known quantities above. As described in @sec-apndx_solve_ivodes, this can be written as an implicit equation for calculating $T_{in}: f_A \big \vert_{z=L} = f_{A,out}$. That implicit equation can be written as a residual expression (see @sec-apndx_solve_ates) and solved numerically.

$$
0 = f_{A,out} - f_A \big \vert_{z=L}
$$

$$
0 = f_{A,out} - \frac{\dot{n}_{A,in} - \dot{n}_A \big\vert_{z=L}}{\dot{n}_{A,in}}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{A,in}f_{A,out} - \dot{n}_{A,in} + \dot{n}_A \big\vert_{z=L}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_A \big \vert_{z=L} - \dot{n}_{A,in}\left( 1 - f_A \right) = \epsilon
$$

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values**

The inlet molar flow rates can be calculated using equations (12) and (13). The inlet temperature, $T_{in}: f_A \big \vert_{z=L} = f_{A,out}$, can be found by numerically solving the implicit equation, (14), for its value.

$$
\dot{n}_{A,in} = \dot{V}_{in}C_{A,in} \tag{12}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{B,in} = \dot{V}_{in}C_{B,in} \tag{13}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_A \big \vert_{z=L} - \dot{n}_{A,in}\left( 1 - f_A \right) = \epsilon \tag{14|}

The calculations were performed as described above. When the feed temperature is `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`, 95% of the A in the feed is converted and the outlet temperature is `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`. When an exothermic reaction occurs in an adiabatic reactor, the temperature is expected to rise. In this case the temperature only rises by 10 °C, so it was not necessary to cool the reacting fluid during processing.

#### Mathematical Formulation of the Solution

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

I need to generate the reactor design equations for modeling this particular PFR. The reactor design equations will be some combination of mole balances, an energy balance on the reacting fluid, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid, and, since this is a PFR, a momentum balance. I prefer to write mole balances on every reagent (other than liquid solvents) in the system. The general steady-state form of the PFR mole balance is given in @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance. There is only one reaction, so the summation becomes one term.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \nu_{i,1}r_1
$$

The PFR is not isothermal, so I must add an energy balance on the reacting gas. @eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance presents the general, steady-state form of the energy balance. None of the terms in the equation can be eliminated, but the two summations can be expanded, and the equation can be rearranged into the form of a derivative expression (see @sec-apndx_solve_ivodes).

$$
\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{d T}{d z} = \pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} =  \frac{\pi DU \left(T_{ex} - T\right)-{\frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \Delta H_1}}{\dot{n}_A \hat{C}_{p,A} + \dot{n}_B \hat{C}_{p,I} + \dot{n}_Y \hat{C}_{p,Y} + \dot{n}_Z \hat{C}_{p,Z}}
$$

There is a vapor that is exchanging its latent heat with the reacting gas. Because only latent heat is being exchanged, the temperature of the heat exchange fluid is constant. That temperature is known, so I can solve the mole and energy balances above independently of an energy balance on the exchange fluid. Furthermore, since the assignment does not ask anything about the exchange fluid, I won't need to use an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid.

The assignment does not mention pressure drop, but it does provide all of the information needed for calculating it using the Ergun equation, @eq-pfr_ergun_eqn. More generally, in a real-world engineering assignment, I would not know wheter pressure drop will be significant or not, so I would want to calculate it.

The reactor design equations are six IVODEs, and they contain six dependent variables ($\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, $\dot{n}_I$, $T$, and $P$), so it isn't necessary to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable. Initial values and a stopping criterion are needed in order to solve the IVODEs numerically. I can define $z=0$ as the inlet to the reactor in which case the other initial values are simply the values of the dependent variables at the reactor inlet. Inlet mole fractions of A and I are specified, and the sum to one, so there isn't any Y or Z in the feed. The reactor length is specified, so that can be used as the stopping criterion.

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically I'll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_3_initial_values. At the start of an integration step the independent and dependent variables ($z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, $\dot{n}_I$, $T$, and $P$) will be known along with the given and known constants listed in the assignment summary. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions, equations (3) through (8).

Examination of those equations reveals $r_1$, $G$ and $\rho$ as unknowns that will need to be calculated. The rate expression, equation (2), can be used to calculate $r_1$, but before that can be done, the two rate coefficients and the partial pressures of the reactants and products must be calculated. The rate coefficients can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, @eq-arrhenius. The partial pressure of reagent $i$ is simply its mole fraction times the total pressure.

$$
P_i = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\sum_i \dot{n}_i}P = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_Y + \dot{n}_Z + \dot{n}_I}P
$$

$G$ can be calculated using its defining equation. The density could be calculated by multipying each molar flow rate times the corresponding molecular weight, to get mass flow rates of each reagent. These could then be totaled and divided by the volumetric flow rate to calculate the density. However, noting that the mass flow rate is constant (no nuclear reactions are taking place), the density can be calculated simply by dividing the mass flow rate by the volumetric flow rate.

$$
G = \frac{4\dot{m}_{in}}{\pi D^2} = \frac{4\dot{m}}{\pi D^2}
$$

$$
\rho = \frac{\dot{m}_{in}}{\dot{V}} = \frac{\dot{m}P}{\left( \dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_Y + \dot{n}_Z + \dot{n}_I \right)RT}

When I solve the IVODEs numerically, I'll also need to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_3_initial_values. The inlet temperature and pressure and the reactor length are known constants. To calculate the inlet molar flow rates of A and I, the total molar flow rate can be calculated using the ideal gas law. Multiplying that by the mole fraction of a reagent will then give the molar flow rate of the reagent.

At this point the reactor design equations can be solved numerically to get corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, $\dot{n}_I$, $T$, and $P$ spanning the range from their initial (inlet) values to their final (outlet) values. Thus, the outlet pressure and temperature are found by solving the IVODEs. The conversion can be calculated using its definition.

The calculateions were performed as described above. The outlet temperature is `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`, the outlet pressure is `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`, and the conversion is `r df$value[3]``r df$units[3]`. This system is similar to that of [Example -@sec-example_13_7_1] in that while the feed is at 400 °C and the heat exchange fluid is at 375 °C, the gas leaving the reactor is at `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`. Apparently the heat absorbed due to reaction greater than that provided by the heat exchange fluid.

The pressure drop here is only `r 3 - as.numeric(df$value[2])` `r df$units[2]`. It is likely that in this case, ignoring the pressure drop would not have affected the calculated outlet temperature and conversion significantly. However, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of the pressure drop in a packed bed. Consequently, it is wise to account for it in case it proves to be more significant.

This assignment describes an adiabatic PFR. The description of the reactor operation does not mention any changes in reactor inputs that might initiate transient behavior, so it is safe to assume that the reactor operates at steady-state. I will summarize the assignment by assigning appropriate variable symbols to all quantities mentioned in the narrative. I'll use "in" and "out" subscripts to denote values at the reactor inlet or outlet, and I'll add values of the gas constant since I know I'll need them.

#### Mathematical Formulation of the Solution

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

I'll need to generate the equations needed to model this reactor and solve them in order to complete this assignment. The reactor is an adiabatic PFR with negligible pressure drop, so I won't need an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid (because there isn't one) or a momentum balance (because pressure drop is negligible). So for this assignment the reactor design equations will consist of mole balances and an energy balance on the reacting gas. I'll write mole balances for each of the five reagents. The general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance is given in @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance. In this assignment, however, the reactor diameter and length are not mentioned, only the volume. Consequently, both sides of the mole balance can be divided by the cross-sectional area of the reactor. Then noting that $\frac{\pi D^2}{4}dz$ is equal to a differential volume element, $dV$, the independent variable can be changed from $z$ to $V$. At the same time, the summataion can be written in terms of the one reaction that is taking place.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{d \dot{n}_i}{\frac{\pi D^2}{4}dz} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j 
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{dV} = \nu_{i,1}r_1
$$

Having changed the independent variable in the mole balances to $V$, an analogous change must be made to the general form of the steady-state PFR reacting fluid energy balance, @eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance, after first noting that the reactor is adiabatic so the heat exchange term is equal to zero. 

$$
\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{d T}{d z} = \cancelto{0}{\pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right)} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$ 

$$
\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{d T}{dV} = \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

Expanding the summations and rearranging yields the steady-state energy balance in the form of a derivative expression.

$$
\frac{d T}{dV} =  \frac{-r_1 \Delta H_1}{\dot{n}_{CO} \hat{C}_{p,CO} + \dot{n}_{H_2O} \hat{C}_{p,H_2O} + \dot{n}_{CO_2} \hat{C}_{p,CO_2} + \dot{n}_{H_2} \hat{C}_{p,H_2} + \dot{n}_I \hat{C}_{p,I}}
$$

**Reactor Design Equations**

Mole balance design equations for CO, H~2~O, CO~2~, H~2~ and I are presented in equations (4) - (8), and the energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (9).

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_{CO}}{dV} = - r_1 \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_{H_2O}}{dV} = - r_1 \tag{5}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_{CO_2}}{dV} = r_1 \tag{6}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_{H_2}}{dV} = r_1 \tag{7}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_I}{dV} = 0.0 \tag{8}
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{dV} =  \frac{-r_1 \Delta H_1}{\dot{n}_{CO} \hat{C}_{p,CO} + \dot{n}_{H_2O} \hat{C}_{p,H_2O} + \dot{n}_{CO_2} \hat{C}_{p,CO_2} + \dot{n}_{H_2} \hat{C}_{p,H_2} + \dot{n}_I \hat{C}_{p,I}} \tag{9}

The number of IVODE design equations (6) is equal to the number of dependent variables appearing in them ($\dot{n}_{CO}$, $\dot{n}_{H_2O}$, $\dot{n}_{CO_2}$, $\dot{n}_{H_2}$, $\dot{n}_{I}$, and $T$), so it is not necessary to eliminate a dependent variable or add an IVODE.

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically, initial values and a stopping criterion are needed. I can define $V=0$ as the inlet to the reactor so that the remaining intial values become equal to the values of the dependent variables at the reactor inlet. The conversion of CO is specifed, so I will use the correspoinding outlet molar flow of CO as the stopping criterion.

I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions.

The only unknown quantity appearing in equations (4) through (9) is the rate. It can be calculated using equation (2). Before doing so, the rate coefficient, $k_1$, the equilibrium constant, $K_1$ and the partial pressures of the reactants and products must be calculated. The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, @eq-arrhenius, and the equilibrium coefficient, using equation (3). No additional unknowns appear in the Arrhenius expression or equation (3). The partial pressures of the reactants can be found by calculating the reactant and product mole fractions and multiplying by the total pressure.

When I solve the IVODEs numerically, I'll also need to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_4_initial_values. The inlet molar flow rates of CO, CO~2~, H~2~, and I, and the inlet temperature are specified in the assignment narrative. I will choose a range of values for the inlet molar flow rate of H~2~O and calculate the corresponding reactor volumes to find the minimum volume. Thus, at the time when the IVODEs are being solved, the inlet molar flow rate of H~2~O will also be known. The outlet molar flow rate of CO, that is the stopping criterion, can be calculated using the specified CO conversion.

At this point I still need a value for inlet the molar flow rate of steam in order to solve the IVODEs. I need to find the value of that flow rate that minimizes the reactor volume. To do that I'll choose a range of values for the inlet flow rate of steam. The assignment provides some guidance on selecting that range in the statement that the steam to carbon monoxide ratio is normally between 3 and 6.

Having chosen a range of values for the inlet molar flow rate of steam the reactor design equations can be solved numerically for each value in the range to get corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_{CO}$, $\dot{n}_{H_2O}$, $\dot{n}_{CO_2}$, $\dot{n}_{H_2}$, $\dot{n}_{I}$, and $T$ spanning the range from their initial (inlet) values to their final (outlet) values. For each inlet steam flow rate, the corresponding reactor volume is the final value of $V$. By examining the results, I can identify the mimimum volume and the corresponding inlet steam flow rate. I can then re-solve the IVODEs using the optimum steam feed rate to find the outlet temperature.

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest**

A range of values of the inlet steam molar flow rate spanning the range from three times the inlet CO flow rate to six times it. For each value in the range the reactor design equations can be solved, yielding values of $z$, $\dot{n}_{CO}$, $\dot{n}_{H_2O}$, $\dot{n}_{CO_2}$, $\dot{n}_{H_2}$, $\dot{n}_{I}$, and $T$ spanning the range from their initial (inlet) values to their final (outlet) values for that inlet steam flow rate. The reactor volume is simply the final value of $V$. The minimum volume and the corresponding inlet molar flow rate of steam can then be identified.

$$
\dot{n}_{H_2O,in,opt}  = \underset{\dot{n}_{H_2O,in}}{\arg\min}\left( V \right) \\tag{16}
$$

The reactor design equations can then be solved using that optimum inlet steam flow rate to verify the minimum volume and to find the outlet temperature.

The calculations were performed as described above. @fig-example_13_7_4_V_vs_H2O_in shows the reactor volume as a function of the steam feed rate, and @fig-example_13_7_4_T_vs_H2O_in shows the outlet temperature. The minimum reactor volume, `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`, occurs at an H~2~O feed rate of `r df$value[1]` `r df$units[1]`. The corresponding outlet temperature is `r df$value[3]` `r df$units[3]`.

The results are reasonable, based upon a quantitative analysis. First, as the amount of steam in the feed increases, it is expected that the outlet temperature will decrease if the conversion is held constant. By holding the conversion constant, the heat given off by the reaction is also constant. As the amount of steam in the feed increases, the heat of reaction gets spread across a larger number of moles, and consequently the temperature rise of the gas is smaller. Since the inlet temperature is constant, this means that the average temperature in the reactor decreases as the amount of steam in the feed increases.

With respect to the rate of reaction, increasing the steam in the feed leads to a greater average partial pressure of steam and a lower average temperature in the reactor. Examining the rate expression, it can be seen that decreasing the average temperature will cause the rate coefficient to decrease, and taken alone, this will always cause the rate to decrease. If the rate is decreasing, then the volume should increase. While that eventually does occur, @fig-example_13_7_4_V_vs_H2O_in shows that at lower steam feed rates, the volume is decreasing, so there must be other factors that are important.

The temperature also affects the equilibrium constant. It will increase as the average temperature decreases (i. e. as the steam feed rate increases). This causes the second term in parentheses in equation (2) to increase. Since that term is being subtracted, increaseing it, taken alone, would also tend to decrease the rate and increase the volume. Thus, the decreasing temperature, taken alone, would lead to a steadily decreasing rate because the rate coefficient would decrease and the term containing the equilibrium constant, which is being subtracted, would increase.

However, increasing the steam feed rate will also lead to a larger average partial pressure of steam in the reactor. The rate expression shows that, taken alone, this would tend to increase the reaction rate. So, the increasing partial pressure of steam tends to increase the rate while the decreasing temperature tends to decrease it. As such, the minimum in the volume seen is @fig-example_13_7_4_V_vs_H2O_in can be explained qualitatively. At lower steam feed rates, the increased steam partial pressure predominates over the decreased temperature leading to an increase in the rate and a corresponding decrease in the volume needed to reach the fixed conversion. Eventually, the effects of increasing steam partial pressure and decreasing temperature become equal and the volume reaches a minimum. Upon further increase in the steam feed rate, the effect of decreasing temperature predominates over the effect of increasing steam partial pressure, and the rate decreases, leading to an increased reactor volume.

The water-gas shift reaction offers an excellent example of a reversible, exothermic reaction. It was noted in the assignment narrative that two reactors are often used. The reactor considered in this assignment is representative of the first of the two reactors. While the system is far from thermodynamic equilibrium, this reactor can operate at higher temperatures where the rate is larger and the corresponding volume is smaller. However, the reaction approaches equilibrium at conversions that are much smaller than desired.

Therefore in commercial practice, in order to reach higher conversions, the product stream from the first reactor is cooled and fed to a second reactor that operates at much lower temperature. The rate in the second reactor is not as large, due to the lower temperature, but the reaction can proceed to much higher conversion before it approaches equilibrium because the equilibrium constant is much smaller. This situation creates an interesting system design/oprimization situation where the total volume of the two reactors can be minimized with respect to the steam feed rate, the temperature of the feed entering the first reactor, the conversion in the first reactor, and the temperature of the feed entering the second reactor.

This assignment describes the start-up of a PFR, so the reactor will be operating in a transient mode. However, the changes that are made to initiate the transient only affect the fluid at the reactor inlet. The flow rate of fluid within the reactor does not change, nor does the amount of heat being exchanged through the reactor wall (the reactor is adiabatic). Because there is no mixing in the axial direction, the sudden change in the reagent concentrations and temperature only affect the inlet. The changes will propagate through the reactor as a front, and, in this case, can be described using the steady-state axial profiles before and after the change. I'll begin by assigning appropriate variable symbols to each quantity mentioned in the assignment. In addition to sub-scripted "in" and "out" to denote quantities at the reactor inlet and outlet, I will use "b" and "a" to indicate values before and after the step changes in concentrations and temperature are applied to the reactor inlet.

#### Mathematical Formulation of the Solution

Because the change propagates as a front I can calculate the position of the front as a function of time. The concentration and temperature profiles ahead of the front are the steady-state profiles prior to the switch and those behind the front are the steady-state profiles after the switch. Therefore, I only need to calculate the steady-state profiels prior to the switch and after the switch.

I really don't need to calculate the front prior to the switch. Pure water at $T_{in,b}$ is flowing steadily through the reactor. There isn't any reaction nor a change in temperature, so the profiles are horizontal lines at $\dot{n}_A$ = 0 and $T_{in,b}$ for all $z$.

After the feed switch has been made and the system has reached steady-state, I can use the general forms of the steady-state PFR mole and energy balances to model the system. I don't need an energy balance on the exchange fluid because there isn't one, and I don't need a momentum balance because pressure drop is negligible.

The general form of the mole balance is given by @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance. There is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}r_1
$$

The general form of the steady-state PFR reacting fluid energy balance is given by @eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance. The narrative provides the gravimetric heat capacity and the density of the liquid phase reacting fluid, to the first term can be modified to use that information. This PFR is adiabatic, so the heat exchange term is equal to zero, and again, there is only one reaction taking place.

$$
\cancelto{\rho \dot{V} \breve{C}_p}{\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)} \frac{d T}{d z} = \cancelto{0}{\pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right)} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\cancelto{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j}
$$

When I solve the design equations numerically, I'm going to need to evaluate the derivatives, so I will re-write the equation in the form of a derivative expression (see @sec-apndx_solve_ivodes).

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\rho \dot{V} \tilde{C}_p}
$$

**Reactor Design Equations**

Mole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z after the feed has been switched and the reactor has reached steady-state are presented in equations (3) through (6). An energy balance on the reacting fluid after the feed has been switched and the reactor has reached steady-state is given in equation (7).

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_A}{dz} = - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_B}{dz} = - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_Y}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{5}
$$

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \tag{6}
$$

$$
\frac{d T}{d z} = -\frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\rho \dot{V} \tilde{C}_p} \tag{7}

There are five IVODE reactor design equations and they contain five dependent variables ($\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and %T%), so there isn't a need to eliminae a dependent variable or add an IVODE.

Initial values and a stopping criterion are needed when solving IVODEs numerically. I can define $z=0$ to be the inlet to the reactor, in which case the other initial values are the molar flow rates and the temperture at the reactor inlet. The feed only contains A and B, so the inlet molar flow rates of Y and Z are zero. The length of the reactor is given, so that can serve as the stopping criterion.

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically I'll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_5_initial_values. At the start of an integration step, the independent ($z$) and dependent variables ($\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$) will be known, as will the given and known constants listed above. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions, equations (3) - (7).

In those equations, the reaction rate, $r_1$, and the volumetric flow rate, $\dot{V}$, are unknown. The rate can be calculated using the rate expression, equation (2). In order to do that, the rate coefficient and the concentrations of A and B must be calculated. The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, @eq-arrhenius. The concentrations can be calculated using the defining equation for concentration in an open system, @eq-concentration_open. The reacting fluid is a liquid; assuming it to be an incompressible ideal mixture means that the volumetric flow rate will be constant and equal to the inlet volumetric flow rate.

When I solve the IVODEs numerically, I'll also need to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_5_initial_values. The reactor length, $L$, and the feed temperature, $T_{in,a}$ are provided in the assignment narrative, and the inlet molar flow rates of A and B can be calculated from their known inlet concentrations and the inlet volumetric flow rate, @eq-concentration_open.

:::

**Ancillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values**

The inlet molar flow rates can be calculated using equations (12) and (13).

$$
\dot{n}_{A,in} = \dot{V}_{in}C_{A,in} \tag{12}
$$

$$
\dot{n}_{B,in} = \dot{V}_{in}C_{B,in} \tag{13}
$$

At this point the IVODEs can be solved for corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ that span the range from their initial values to their final values. That is, at this point I will have calculated the profiles of $\dot{n}_A$ and $T$ along the length of the reactor at steady-state.

The reacting fluid is an incompressible liquid, so the linear velocity of the front is simply the volumetric flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the tubular reactor.

$$
v = \frac{\dot{V}}{\frac{\pi D^2}{4}} = \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}
$$

The position of the front at any elapsed time after the switch can be calculated from its velocity.

$$
z_{front} = tv = \frac{4 \dot{V}t}{\pi D^2}
$$

As the front propagates through the reactor, the profile ahead of the front will equal the steady-state profile prior to the feed switch and the profile behind the front will equal the steady-state profile after the feed switch.

:::

Solving the reactor design equations yields corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$, $\dot{n}_B$, $\dot{n}_Y$, $\dot{n}_Z$, and $T$ that span the range from their initial (feed) values to their final (outlet) values. That is, solving the reactor design equations will yield, among other things, $\dot{n}_{A,a}$ and $T_a$ as functions of $z$ when steady-state has been reached after the feed switch. Prior to the feed switch the molar flow rate of A, $\dot{n}_{A,b}$, and the temperature, $T_b$, are constant for all $z$

Noting that the fluid is incompressible and the tube diameter is constant, the position of the front at any time following the switch can be calculated using equation (14). The profiles of interest then can be calculated using equations (15) and (16)

$$
z_{front} = \frac{4 \dot{V}t}{\pi D^2} \tag{14}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
\dot{n}_A\left(z\right) &= \dot{n}_{A,a}\left(z\right) \qquad z \le z_{front} \\
\dot{n}_A\left(z\right) &= \dot{n}_{A,b}\left(z\right) \qquad z > z_{front}
\end{align} \tag{15}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
T\left(z\right) &= T_a\left(z\right) \qquad z \le z_{front} \\
T\left(z\right) &= T_b\left(z\right) \qquad z > z_{front}
\end{align} \tag{16}
$$

#### Results and Discussion

The calculations were performed as described above. Profiles of the molar flow rate of A and the temperature within the reactor 0.131, 0.262, 0.393, and 0.524 min after the feed switch are shown in @fig-example_13_7_5_profiles. For an incompressible fluid flowing through a PFR at steady-state, the space time is equal to the amount of time the fluid spends within the reactor. Thus, as the figure shows, the front has just reached the outlet of the PFR at a time equal to the space time. For any times greater than this, the profile be invariant with the shape shown in the bottom panel of the figure because after one spece time, the reactor will have reached its new steady state.

Concentration (blue) and temperature (red) profiles 0.131, 0.262, 0.393, and 0,524 min after the feed flow started (top to bottom).
:::

The profiles shown in @fig-example_13_7_5_profiles seem a bit unrealistic. Consider what the transient PFR model would predict if only the temperature of the water flowing into this had been changed and without adding reactant to the feed. The model would predict that 0.262 minutes later the temperature of the first half of the reactor would be at 30 °C, and the temperature in the second half of the reactor would be 25 °C, with an abrupt change at the middle of the reactor. A very sharp transition like that is counter-intuitive. Instead, one might expect a smoother transition from hot to cold, not an instantaneous step change. The axial dispersion model presented in @sec-7_axial_dispersion pridicts a smoother, and intuitively more reasonable, temperature transition.

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Note

The method of analysis used in this example only applies in the special case where the transient is initiated by step changes in reagent concentration and or temperature at the inlet to the PFR. If the volumetric flow rate had changed, this method of analysis would not be applicable because a change in inlet flow rate affects all of the fluid in the reactor, not just the fluid entering it. Similarly, if there had been heat exchange through the reactor wall and the temperature of the exchange fluid had changed, this method of analysis would not be applicable, again because all of the fluid in the reactor would be affected, not just that entering it.

#### Mathematical Formulation of the Solution

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

In order to complete this assignment, I am going to need to generate an appropriate set of reactor design equations and solve them. The reactor design equations must always include mole balances. I will write mole balances for both A and Z. The general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance is shown in @eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

However, that form of the mole balance assumes that the rate is normalized per volume of reactor (or here per volume of packed bed), that there aren't any composition or temperature gradients between the fluid and the catalyst particles, and that there aren't any gradients within the particles. The rate expression provided in the assignment is normalized per catalyst particle volume. Noting that there is only one reaction taking place, the mole balance can be modified to account for the normalization of the rate.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}\frac{V_{part}}{V_{bed}}r_1
$$

The particle volume is the bed volume minus the void volume, and the void volume is equal to the bed volume times the void fraction.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z} &= \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}\frac{V_{part}}{V_{bed}}r_1 \\&= \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}\frac{V_{bed} - V_{void}}{V_{bed}}r_1 \\&= \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}\frac{V_{bed} -  \epsilon V_{bed}}{V_{bed}}r_1 = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}\left( 1 -  \epsilon \right)r_1
\end{align}
$$

That accounts for the rate normalization. The assignment states that there aren't any gradients external to the particles and that there aren't any temperature gradients within the particles. However, there may be concentration gradients within the particles. One way to account for any internal concentration gradients is to multiply the rate by the effectiveness factor. Doing so yields a mole balance where the normalization of the rate has been accounted for as have any concentration gradients within the particles.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\nu_{i,1}\left( 1 -  \epsilon \right)\eta r_1
$$

The assignment states that the reactor is isothermal and there aren't any temperature gradients anywhere. In that case, I can solve the mole balance equations independently of the energy balance on the reacting fluid and the energy balance on the heat exchange fluid. Since the assignment does not ask any questions associated with either of those balances, I do not need to include them. The assignment does not mention whether or not there is a pressure drop in the reactor. As such, I'll need to include a momentum balance in case pressure drop is significant. The steady-state momentum balance for a PFR is given in @eq-pfr_ergun_eqn.

:::

**Reactor Design Equations**

Mole balance design equations for A and Z are presented in equations (3) and (4), and a momentum balance is shown in equation (5).

$$
\frac{\dot{n}_A}{dz} = - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\left(1-\varepsilon \right)\eta r_1 \tag{3}
$$

$$
\frac{\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\left(1-\varepsilon \right)\eta r_1 \tag{4}
$$

$$
\frac{{dP}}{{dz}} =  - \frac{{1 - \varepsilon }}{{{\varepsilon ^3}}}\frac{{{G^2}}}{{\rho {\Phi _s}{D_p}}}\left[ {\frac{{150\left( {1 - \varepsilon } \right)\mu }}{{{\Phi _s}{D_p}G}} + 1.75} \right] \tag{5}
$$

The reactor design equations consist of three IVODEs and they contain three dependent variables ($\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$) so there isn't any need to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable.

Initial values and a stopping criterion are needed when solving IVODEs numerically. I can define $z=0$ as the reactor inlet, in which case the other initial values are simply the values of the dependent variables at the reactor inlet. Here the reactor is fed pure A, so the initial molar flow rate of Z is equal to zero. I know the conversion, so I can calculate the outlet molar flow rate of A and use it as the stopping criterion.

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically I'll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_6_initial_values.

At the start of each integration step $z$, $\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$ will be known along with the given and known constants listed in the assignment summary. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions. Examination of equations (3) - (5) shows that for this assigment I'll need to calculate $\eta$, $r_1$, $G$, $\rho$, and $\Phi_s$.

The catalyst particles are spherical, so I can calculate the effectiveness factor using @eq-change_to_correct_cross_ref. In order to do that, I will first need to calculate the Thiele modulus for a spherical particle using @eq-change_to_correct_cross_ref and noting that the particle radius is half of its diameter.

$$
\eta = \frac{3}{\phi}\left( \frac{1}{\tanh{\phi}} - \frac{1}{\phi} \right)
$$

$$
\phi = R_{\text{part}}\sqrt{\frac{k}{D_{eA}}} = \frac{D_{\text{part}}}{2}\sqrt{\frac{k}{D_{eA}}}
$$

The rate can be calculated using the given rate expression, equation (2), but in order to do so the concentration must first be calculated. Than can be done using the defining equation for concentration in an open system and the ideal gas equation.

$$
C_A = \frac{\dot{n}_A}{\dot{V}} = \frac{\dot{n}_A}{\dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_Z}\frac{P}{RT}
$$

The mass flux, $G$, can be calculated using its definition. To do that, the mass flow rate is needed. Here the inlet mass flow rate is given, but at steady state, the mass flow rate does not change because no nuclear reactions are taking place.

$$
G = \frac{4\dot{m}}{\pi D^2} = \frac{4\dot{m}_{in}}{\pi D^2}
$$

I don't know the molecular weight of A and Z, but I can calculate the density of the fluid by dividing the mass flow rate by the volumetric flow rate, again noting that the mass flow rate is constant and equal to the inlet mass flow rate.

$$
\rho = \frac{\dot{m}}{\dot{V}} = \frac{\dot{m}_{in}P}{\left( \dot{n}_A + \dot{n}_Z \right)RT}
$$

When I solve the IVODEs numerically, I'll also need to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_6_initial_values. The inlet pressure is given in the assignment narrative. The inlet molar flow rate of A can be calculated using the ideal gas law. Once that has been done, the outlet molar flow rate of A can be calculated using its known conversion.

At this point the reactor design equations can be solved numerically to get corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$ spanning the range from their initial values to their final values (i.e. from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet). The final value of $z$ is the length of the reactor, which is what the assignment asked for.

:::

Solving the reactor design equations yields corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$ spanning the range from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet. The final value of $z$, then, is the length of the reactor, $L$.

**Calculations Summary**

1. Substitute given and known constants into all equations.
2. When it is necessary to evaluate the derivatives
	a. $z$, $\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$ will be available.
	b. calculate $\phi$, $C_A$, $G$, and $\rho$ using equations (6), (8), (9), and (10).
	c. calculate $\eta$ using equation (7).
	d. evaluate the derivatives using equations (3) - (5).
3. When it is necessary to calculate the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_6_initial_values
	a. $P_{in}$ is a known constant.
	b. calculate $\dot{n}_{A,in}$ and $\dot{n}_{A,out}$ using equations (11) and (12)

#### Numerical implementation of the Solution

1. Make the given and known constants available for use in all functions.
2. Write a derivatives function that
	a. receives the independent and dependent variables, $z$, $\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$, as arguments,
	b. evaluates the derivatives as described in step 2 of the calculations summary, and returns their values.
3. Write a reactor model function that
	a. alculates the initial and final values in @tbl-example_13_7_6_initial_values as described in step 3 of the calculations summary,
	c. gets corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$, spanning the range from their initial values to their final values by calling an IVODE solver and passing the following information to it
		i. the initial values and stopping criterion in @tbl-example_13_7_6_initial_values and
		ii. the name of the derivatives function from step 3 above,
	d, checks that the solver successfully solved the IVODEs, and
	e. returns the values returned by the IVODE solver.
6. Perform the analysis by
	a. calling the reactor model function from step 3 above to get corresponding sets of values of $z$, $\dot{n}_A$,$\dot{n}_Z$, and $P$, spanning the range from their initial values to their final values.
	b. extracting the final value of $z$, which is the length of the reactor $L$.

#### Results and Discussion

```{r}

df <- fmt_tibble_col(df, 2, 3, 3, 1)
```

The calculations were performed as described above. During the calculations it is found that the effectiveness factor is `r df$value[1]`, resulting in a reactor length of `r df$value[2]` `r df$units[2]`. If the effectiveness factor was not used to correct for the concentration gradients within the catalyst particles, a significantly shorter length of `r df$value[5]` `r df$units[5]` would have been calculated corresponding to an error of almost 12%. 

The calculations also show that the pressure drop is negligible; the calculated outlet pressure is `r df$value[3]` `r df$units[3]`, which is equal to the inlet pressure. Nonetheless, this calculation was necessary because there was no way of knowing ahead of time whether the pressure drop would be significant.

## Note

This example serves to show that when a reacting system consists of more than one phase, it is essential to check for gradients in the fluid phases close to interfaces and, if there are porous solids, within the pores. The equations developed and used in *Reaction Engineering Basics* assume that the reacting fluid is homogeneous, i. e. that no such gradients exist. Using those reactor design equations to model systems where gradients do exist can result is significant error.

There are much more rigorous ways to account for gradients in a reacting system. Doing so is often a substantial component of intermediate and advanced reaction engineering textbooks and courses.
