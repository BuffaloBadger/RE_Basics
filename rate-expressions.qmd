# Rate Expressions

The first section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* included an introduction to the field of reaction engineering. Mathematical modeling is a significant component of reaction engineering. The preceeding section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* noted that reaction engineering often involves three levels of modeling. At the top level, a process system is modeled. A reactor is among the components of the process system, so a reactor model is used within the process model. Within the reactor model, a model for the rates of the prevailing chemical reactions is needed. Mathematical models for the rates of chemical reactions are commonly called rate expressions. This second section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* defines and examines chemical reaction rates and rate expressions.
