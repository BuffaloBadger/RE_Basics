# Reactor Heat Exchange {#sec-reactor-heat-transfer}

There are many different system geometries and heat exchanger types that can be used to add or remove heat from a reactor. In order to maintain a focus on the reaction, *Reaction Engineering Basics* problems involving heat exchange always use a perfectly mixed shell or jacket geometry through which a heat exchange fluid flows. The heat exchange fluid exchanges *either* sensible heat *or* latent heat, but *not both*. This appendix presents a brief overview on using this form of heat exchange with stirred tanks and tubular reactors.

## Mass and Energy Balances on the Heat Exchange Fluid

@fig-heat-exch-stirred depicts batch, semi-batch and continuous stirred tank reactors with heat exchange. @fig-heat-exch-tube similarly depicts a tubular reactor with heat exchange. The figures are not intended to convey the actual geometry of the reactors. The blue shading represents the reacting fluid within the reactor and the yellow shading represents perfectly-mixed heat exchange fluid within the shell/jacket. The red line represents the wall separating the reacting fluid from the heat exchange fluid. Heat is transferred through this wall, all other walls are assumed to be perfectly insulated.

The inputs, outputs and flow patterns on the reaction side differ for each of the four reactors shown in [Figures -@fig-heat-exch-stirred] and [-@fig-heat-exch-tube]. However, the inputs, outputs and flow pattern on the shell/jacket sides of the four reactors are identical. Consequently, the mass balance and the energy balance on the heat exchange fluid is the same for all four reactors.

### Mass Balance on the Heat Exchange Fluid

In *Reaction Engineering Basics* it is always assumed that there is no accumulation of mass in the reactor shell/jacket. Mass cannot be generated (other than by nuclear reactions), so there is no generation of mass within the reactor shell/jacket, either. Consequently the inlet and outlet mass flow rates are always equal, as shown in the figures. Note that the mass flow rate of the heat exchange fluid can vary with time, but any change in the inlet mass flow rate is accompanied instantaneously by an equal change in the outlet mass flow rate.

### Energy Balance on the Heat Exchange Fluid

With the assumption of no mass accumulation in the shell/jacket, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid takes the form shown in @eq-ext-fluid-energy-bal. In that equation, $\dot Q_e$ is the rate of heat input from the reacting fluid through the wall separating the reaction and shell/jacket sides of the reactor, and $\left( \tilde h_{e,in} - \tilde h_e \right)$ is the change in the specific enthalpy of the heat exchange fluid between the inlet and outlet of the shell/jacket.

$$
\rho_e V_e \tilde C_{p,e}\frac{dT_e}{dt} = \dot Q_e + \dot m_e \left( \tilde h_{e,in} - \tilde h_e \right)
$${#eq-ext-fluid-energy-bal}

As noted in the introduction to this appendix, in *Reaction Engineering Basics* it is assumed that the heat exchange fluid exchanges *either* sensible heat *or* latent heat, *but not* both. If the heat exchange fluid exchanges *only* sensible heat, the change in specific enthalpy is given by @eq-sens-heat-exchanged.

$$
\left( \tilde h_{e,in} - \tilde h_{e} \right) = -\int_{T_{e,in}}^{T_e} \tilde C_{p,e}dT
$$ {#eq-sens-heat-exchanged}

If the heat exchange fluid exchanges *only* latent heat, the change in specific enthalpy is given by @eq-latent-heat-exchanged. The heat exchange fluid enters the shell/jacket as a saturated vapor (if it is being used to supply heat) or as a liquid at its boiling point (if it is being used to remove heat). Within the shell/jacket, some fraction of the feed changes phase (e. g. steam condenses or the liquid boils). This occurs at a constant and known temperature, $T_e$, (the boiling point). When $T_e$ is constant and known, the reaction side mole and energy balances can be solved separately from the heat exchange fluid energy balance.

$$
\left( \tilde h_{e,in} - \tilde h_e \right) = \frac{-\Delta H_{\text{latent},e}^0}{M_e}
$$ {#eq-latent-heat-exchanged}

The maximum *latent* heat that can be provided or removed corresponds to complete condensation or complete vaporization of the heat exchange fluid. As noted, the heat exchange fluid energy balance is not needed for solving the reaction side mole and energy balances, but it can be used, instead, to calculate the minimum heat exchange fluid flow rate (i. e. the flow rate that corresponds to complete condensation or complete vaporization of the heat exchange fluid.) 

Also, because heat is only transferred through the wall separating the two fluids, the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid, $\dot Q$, and the rate of heat input to the shell/jacket, $\dot Q_e$ are related as shown in @eq-equal-heat-exchange.

$$
\dot Q_e = - \dot Q

## Heat Exchange with the Reacting Fluid in a Stirred Tank

In stirred tanks, @fig-heat-exch-stirred, the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed. As a consequence, at any instant in time, the temperature, $T$ is the same everywhere within the blue volume. Similarly, because the heat exchange fluid is perfectly mixed, the temperature, $T_e$ is the same everywhere within the yellow volume. Consequently, the instantaneous rate of heat transfer from the heat exchange fluid to the reacting fluid, $\dot Q$, can be calculated using the overall heat transfer coefficient, $U$, and the area, $A$, of the wall separating the two sides of the reactor, @eq-heat-trans-rate.

$$\dot Q = UA\left(T_e - T\right)$$ {#eq-heat-trans-rate}

Of the stirred tank reactor types, only CSTRs can operate at steady-state. When a CSTR is operating at steady state, the derivative in the energy balance, @eq-ext-fluid-energy-bal, is equal to zero, leading to @eq-ss-ext-fluid-energy-bal.

$$0 = \dot Q_e + \dot m_e \left( \tilde h_{e,in} - \tilde h_e \right)$${#eq-ss-ext-fluid-energy-bal}

## Heat Exchange with the Reacting Fluid in a Tubular Reactor

In a tubular reactor, the reaction side fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial direction, but it is completely unmixed in the axial direction. The gradient in the blue shading in @fig-heat-exch-tube is meant to convey this point. As a consequence, the temperature difference between the reacting fluid and the heat exchange fluid changes along the length of the tube. That means that the rate of heat transfer also varies along the length of the tube. In *Reaction Engineering Basics*, it is assumed that the overall, local heat transfer coefficient, $U$, is constant along the length of the reactor so that the total heat input to the reacting fluid from the heat exchange fluid is given by @eq-heat-trans-rate-tube.

$$
\dot Q = \int_0^L \pi DU\left( T_e - T \right)dz
$$ {#eq-heat-trans-rate-tube}

As is the case for steady-state CSTR, when a tubular reactor operates at steady state, the heat exchange fluid energy balance is given by @eq-ss-ext-fluid-energy-bal.
