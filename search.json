    "text": "Preface\nReaction Engineering Basics is an introductory textbook on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. There are many excellent introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks. Like many other textbooks, Reaction Engineering Basics, limits kinetics data analysis problems to isothermal systems with a single reaction taking place (though it does not limit the analysis to systems where linear least squares can be used). However, as it moves into the area of reaction engineering, Reaction Engineering Basics is different from many other textbooks in two respects. First, Reaction Engineering Basics does not start with systems with single reactions taking place in isothermal reactors and then introduce systems with multiple reactions or systems requiring an energy balance in subsequent chapters. The reaction engineering section of Reaction Engineering Basics starts with systems that require mole and energy balances and that feature multiple reactions. Second, Reaction Engineering Basics differs from many other introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks by using numerical methods to solve almost all of the problems it presents. The one exception is that analytic algebra is used when generating rate expressions for non-elementary reactions from proposed mechanisms for those reactions.\nReaction Engineering Basics was written for use in an undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum. The intended audience is students who have completed approximately two years of a four-year chemical engineering degree program. While very brief overviews of important topics are included, generally Reaction Engineering Basics assumes that readers have completed two semesters of general chemistry, a course on chemical engineering mass and energy balances and, ideally, a course on chemical engineering thermodynamics. Proficiency in algebra, calculus and differential equations is also assumed. Appendix B — Prerequisite Knowledge provides a few more specifics on prerequisite knowledge.",

    "text": "Practice Problems and Numerical Methods\nEach chapter of Reaction Engineering Basics includes illustrative example problems with solutions. Beyond showing what to do to solve the problem, the solutions attempt to expose expert thinking by describing how an expert knows to do those things. The solutions describe in detail how to solve the problems, in most cases using numerical methods. They also present and discuss the results from solving the problem. However, the solutions in Reaction Engineering Basics do not include actual computer code used to solve the problems.\nInstead, the solutions are written in a way that should make it easy for students to implement the calculations using computational tools they are familiar with, that are available to them or, if using this textbook as part of a formal course, that are required by the course instructor. In this way, Reaction Engineering Basics is not tied to any one brand of software or computational tool.\nAn online Self-study Course on Reaction Engineering, SCoRE, is planned as soon as Reaction Engineering Basics is completed. Video solutions to most Reaction Engineering Basics example problems will be available in SCoRE. These will include detailed explanations of how the numerical computations can be performed using either Python or Matlab. SCoRE will also provide Python and Matlab utility functions for the essential numerical methods used in Reaction Engineering Basics. Python was chosen because it is freely available online; Matlab was chosen because it is licensed by many universities (including the author’s) for instructional use. As part of presenting solutions to Reaction Engineering Basics example problems, the video solutions that are included in SCoRE will describe how to write and execute the necessary code.\nReaction Engineering Basics does not include end-of-chapter practice problems. Once again, practice problems with solutions, will be available in SCoRE.",

I owe her a debt that I can’t hope to repay, but at the very least, I can thank and acknowledge her for all she has done and continues to do. So thanks, Deb, you’re the best!\nI was fortunate and blessed to receive a fantastic formal eduction. From grade school through graduate school I’ve been taught by many outstanding educators, and I thank them all. Two in particular stand out. Jim Dumesic, “the Boss,” is one. When he became my PhD advisor, I expected it to be a 4 to 5 year deal. It wasn’t. Jim has been my mentor, trusted advisor and true friend ever since that day. For over forty years, he’s always been there for me, and I can’t thank him enough. The other standout is Phil Wankat. Without going into the details, I was ready to change majors after my first undergraduate chemical engineering course. It didn’t happen because Phil Wankat taught the second chemical engineering course I took, one on stagewise separations. He is the best teacher I ever had, and his teaching and personality are directly responsible for me being a chemical engineer today.\nThe University at Buffalo, its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and its Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering have been my professional home since 1986. They have provided an environment that is equally supportive of educational innovation and, in my case, catalysis and reaction engineering research. I appreciate that educational innovation is not only supported, it is recognized and rewarded.\nPersonally, I believe there is a God who blessed me with the ability, circumstances and perseverence to write this book.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Defining and Characterizing Chemical Reactions\nA chemical reaction involves a group of atoms. Before the reaction occurs, there are bonds between some of the atoms, so that the system consists of one or more molecules and/or free atoms. Collectively, these chemical species are called the reactants. A chemical reaction is a molecular event wherein at least one chemical bond is broken or formed. As a consequence, after the reaction occurs, the system consists of a different set of chemical species. Collectively, these chemical species are called the products.\nAs an example Figure 1.1 shows a schematic representation of a system containing two oxygen atoms and four hydrogen atoms. In Figure 1.1 (a), the oxygen atoms are bonded to each other and each of the hydrogen atoms is bonded to one other hydrogen atom. As a result, there are three chemical species or reagents: an O2 molecule and 2 H2 molecules. If this is the state of a chemical system before a reaction occurs, this group of reagents could be referred to, collectively, as the reactants. When a chemical reaction occurs, the bonding between the atoms in the system changes. For example, Figure 1.1 (b) shows the same six atoms, but the bonding among them is different. Each of the oxygen atoms is bonded to two hydrogen atoms giving two chemical species both being water molecules. If this is the state of the chemical system after the reaction has occurred, then this group of reagents, collectively, is called the products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Reactants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: In a chemical reaction, the atoms do not change, but the bonding between them does change.\n\n\n\nSo to summarize the example, before the reaction, the chemical system consisted of three reactants: an O2 molecule and two H2 molecules. The reaction changed the bonding among the atoms, so that after the reaction the chemical system consisted of two species, the products, both being water molecules. It is very important to recognize that the exact same set of six atoms is present throughout the process. This is the basis of chemical reaction stoichiometry. Stoichiometry is examined in more detail in the next sub-section.\nIt’s important to understand that chemical reactions are bi-directional. In terms of the example here, a chemical system might initially contain two water molecules, and a chemical reaction could occur to produce one oxygen molecule and 2 hydrogen molecules. What that means, among other things, is that the identity of the reactants and the identity of the products is context specific. In one situation, two H2O molecules might be the reactants with O2 and two H2 as the products, and in a different situation, O2 and two H2 might be the reactants and 2 H2O, the products.\nThere is another very important subtlety to the definition of a chemical reaction as a molecular process that converts reactants into products, by changing the bonding among the atoms. Specifically, the issue is whether all the bonds break and form simultaneously, or, alternatively, whether the process occurs in more than one step. Figure 1.2 shows that same representation of the hydrogen combustion reaction, but with the reactant bonds that will break colored red and the bonds that will form colored green. This particular reaction is unusual in that every bond in the reactants breaks and four new oxygen-hydrogen bonds form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: When molecular hydrogen is oxidized three bonds (red) break and four bonds (green) form.\n\n\n\nIf all of the bond breaking and forming occurs simultaneously, then this reaction would be called an elementary reaction. In an elementary reaction, all of the reactants come very close to each other, and all of the bonds that are going to do so begin to break or form. While this is happening, the system consists of a single species. That species is call the activated complex. The lifetime of the activated complex is extremely short. Even as the reactants are forming the activated complex, it is beginning to break apart into the products.\nThe alternative is that the bond breaking and forming is not simultaneous, but it occurs sequentially. Given the large number of bonds that are breaking and forming during hydrogen combustion, it is likely that they break and form sequentially. That would mean that hydrogen combustion is a non-elementary reaction. Instead of a single reaction event where all of the bonds break and form, the O2 molecule and one of the H2 molecules might react to form two hydroxyl radicals. Products like these hydroxyl radicals are often called intermediates or reactive intermediates. The reactive intermediates do not have to be free radicals, they also can be neutral species with all electrons paired or they can be ions. One key feature of the intermediates is that their lifetimes are very short compared to the lifetime of the reactants and products.\nContinuing with hydrogen combustion, if the first step resulted in formation of two hydroxyl radicals, then those radicals would react very quickly. That might generate new intermediates, and they, too, would react quickly. The net result is that the reactants are converted to intermediates that, in turn, are very quickly converted to products. While the intermediates react very rapidly, they are present and could be detected using sophisticated equipment. As such, their lifetimes are longer than an activated complex in an elementary reaction, but still quite short.\nAnother way to look at the intermediates is to remember that from a macroscopic perspective it appears that the single non-elementary reaction is all that is happening. If the intermediates were present in significant quantity, then from a macroscopic perspective, they would be observed, and it would no longer appear that only one reaction was taking place. So while it appears that only one reaction is taking place from a macroscopic perspective, if one was able to observe the system at the microscopic or molecular level, it would be seen that actually more than one reaction was taking place and that the intermediates were being formed and consumed in those reactions.\nIt is worth noting that the number of reactant molecules participating in a chemical reaction event is used as one means of classifying reactions. If there is only one reactant in a chemical reaction event, that reaction can be referred to as a unimolecular reaction. If there are two reactants, either two of the same molecule or one each of two different molecules, the reaction can be referred to as a bimolecular reaction. A termolecular reaction has three reactant molecules. When a single molecule is the only reactant and there is also a single molecule as the only product, the reaction can additionally be called an intramolecular reaction. In an intramolecular reaction all bond breaking and forming is internal to the single molecule involved in the reaction. Other means of classifying reactions are described later in this chapter.\n\n\n1.1.2 Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry\nThe preceding sub-section defined a chemical reaction as a molecular process wherein reactants were converted to products due to changes in the chemical bonding. The fact that the number of atoms and their identities do not change, but the bonding between them does change is the basis of chemical reaction stoichiometry. Before discussing stoichiometry, though, it may be worth noting that the word “reaction” has two meanings. One use of the word “reaction” refers to the molecular process as previously defined. But the word “reaction” is also used to refer to the written expression that is used to represent and describe that molecular process.\nFor example, in the preceding sub-section the word “reaction” was used to refer to a molecular bond breaking and forming process involving hydrogen and oxygen atoms. That process can be represented by the following expression.\n\\[\n2 H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2 H_2O\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nThe word “reaction” is used to refer to the molecular event, and it is also used to refer to the expression, e. g. Reaction 1.1. In most circumstances, these two uses for the word “reaction” don’t cause any confusion. In this sub-section, however, they might. Therefore, for the remainder of this sub-section the phrase “molecular reaction event” will be used to refer to the molecular event and the phrase “reaction expression” will be used to refer to the expression representing that event.\nEach time the molecular reaction event occurs the same number of molecules of each reactant is converted into the same number of molecules of each product. For example every time the hydrogen combustion molecular reaction event occurs, one O2 molecule and two H2 molecules are converted into two water molecules. The fixed proportions in which the reactants and products participate are referred to collectively as the stoichiometry of the reaction.\nHere’s that reaction expression for hydrogen combustion again.\n\\[\n2 H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2 H_2O\n\\]\nIn this case, the reaction expression contains an arrow that points to the right. To the left of the arrow the chemical formula for each unique reactant in the molecular reaction event is written. The chemical formulae of the reactants are separated by plus signs, and each is preceded by the number of molecules of that species that participates in the molecular reaction event. If no number precedes the chemical formula, that implies a value of one. Hence here we see a 2 preceding the H2 in the reaction expression because two H2 molecules participate as reactants in the hydrogen combustion reaction event. A plus sign then separates the chemical formula for H2 from that for O2, because O2 also participates as a reactant in the hydrogen combustion reaction event. The absence of a number preceding the O2 implies a value of 1, which is the number of O2 molecules that participate in the reaction event as reactants. The numbers preceding the chemical species are called stoichiometric coefficients. The arrow in the reaction expression points to a similar listing of the chemical species that are products in the molecular reaction event.\nA number of different styles of arrows are used when writing reaction expressions. The style of the arrow sometimes has special meaning. For example, sometimes a double arrow is used where there are two arrows one above the other and pointing in opposite directions (\\(\\rightleftarrows\\)). A double arrow is a reminder that chemical reactions are bidirectional. It sometimes additionally signifies that the reaction is reversible, a concept that will be discussed later in this chapter.\nReturning to the reaction expression for hydrogen combustion, a common way of reading a reaction expression is to read the reactants, say “goes to” and then read the products. Here, for example one could read the reaction expression as two H2 plus one O2 goes to two H2O. Because chemical reaction events are bi-directional, the reaction as written in the reaction expression is sometimes called the forward reaction. For the reaction as written here, then, the reaction event where two water molecules react to form two hydrogen molecules and an oxygen molecule can be referred to as the reverse reaction.\nNotice that the total number of each type of atom on the left side of the reaction expression is equal to the total number of that type of atom on the right side of the reaction expression. This is a consequence of reaction stoichiometry, and it must be true for every element that appears in a reaction expression. When it is true, the reaction expression is said to be balanced.\nThe reaction expression for hydrogen oxidation, above, is balanced because there are four H atoms on each side of the arrow and two O atoms on each side of the arrow. In that reaction expression, the number preceding each chemical formula is equal to the number of that species that participate in the molecular reaction event. This is not required, though. The reaction expression only needs to convey the proportions in which the reagents appear in the molecular reaction event, and not necessarily the exact number of molecules of the reagents.\n\\[\nH_2 + \\frac{1}{2} O_2 \\rightarrow H_2O\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nReaction 1.2 is an equally valid reaction expression for hydrogen combustion. Clearly, the stoichiometric coefficients here are not equal to the number of the molecules in the molecular reaction event, because there is no such thing as one-half of an O2 molecule. Nevertheless, it is sometimes convenient to write the reaction expression so that the stoichiometric coefficient of one of the products has a magnitude of one. An example is the reaction expression used for a heat of formation (see Appendix D). It still is required that the reaction expression be balanced. In Reaction 1.2 there are 2 H atoms and 1 O atom on each side of the arrow, so it is balanced. Those are the same proportions as when the reaction expression is written as in Reaction 1.1.\nAs previously noted, the numbers that appear in a reaction expression, including the implied ones, are called stoichiometric coefficients. Each unique chemical species that participates in the molecular reaction event has a corresponding stoichiometric coefficient in the reaction expression. It is important to note that the stoichiometric coefficients are taken from the reaction expression, not the reaction event. In other words, the stoichiometric coefficient of H2O in the hydrogen combustion reaction could be either one or two, depending upon which of the two reaction expressions, Reaction 1.1 or Reaction 1.2, is being used to represent the reaction event.\nThe lower-case Greek letter, \\(\\nu_{i,j}\\), is used in Reaction Engineering Basics to represent stoichiometric coefficients. The first subscript, \\(i\\), identifies the chemical species, so \\(i\\) will be a chemical formula. If more than one reaction is taking place, there will be a second subscript, \\(j\\). The subscript \\(j\\) identifies one of the reactions taking place. Typically, when solving problems, we number the reactions, in which case \\(j\\) will be a number.\nReaction Engineering Basics uses a sign convention for stoichiometric coefficients where \\(\\nu\\) for a species appearing as a reactant in the reaction expression is negative, and \\(\\nu\\) for a species that is a product in the reaction expression is positive. (See Appendix C for a complete listing of sign conventions and notation used in Reaction Engineering Basics.) Thus, the stoichiometric coefficient of H2 in Reaction 1.1 is written as \\(\\nu_{H_2,1.1}\\) and is equal to -2. If a species does not appear in the reaction expression for reaction \\(j\\), then its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction \\(j\\) is equal to zero.\nAgain, it is very important to realize and remember that the magnitude of a species’ stoichiometric coefficient is the number that preceeds it in the reaction expression. That may or may not equal the number of molecules of that species participating in the molecular reaction event. As shown here, the stoichiometric coefficients of the reagents in hydrogen combustion change, depending upon the way the reaction expression is written.\n\n\n1.1.3 Chemical Reaction Thermodynamics\nChemical reactions are processes where chemical bonds are formed and broken. Chemical bonds can be viewed as a form of stored energy. Chemical bond strength, that is, the amount of energy stored in chemical bonds, varies from bond type to bond type. As a consequence, when bonds break and form during a chemical reaction, there is a net change in the amount of energy being stored in chemical bonds. As a reaction takes place, that difference in the amount of stored energy between reactants and products is released into or extracted from the system in the form of heat. That heat is called the heat of reaction. If heat is extracted from the system, the heat of reaction is positive and the reaction is called an endothermic reaction. If heat is released into the system, the heat of reaction is negative and the reaction is called an exothermic reaction. Appendix D presents a brief review of how to calculate the heat of a given reaction.\nAll chemical reactions are bidirectional. When the rate at which reactants are being converted into products is equal to the rate at which products are being converted into reactants, the reaction is at equilibrium. At reaction equilibrium, the composition of the system is static; it does not change. Thermodynamics can be used to calculate an equilibrium constant, which, in turn can be used to calculate the composition of the system at reaction equilibrium. The equilibrium constant for a reaction changes with the system temperature. Appendix D presents a brief review of how to calculate equilibrium constants and the equilibrium composition for a reacting system.\n\n\n1.1.4 Composition of Reacting Systems\nThe systems considered so far in this chapter contained only contain enough atoms for a chemical reaction to occur one time. Systems of that size are great for the purpose of defining a chemical reaction. There were basically only two possibilities for the components of those systems. Depending upon the bonding, the system either consisted of one set of reactant molecules or it consisted of one set of product molecules. When it comes to reaction engineering or any other real-world chemical process, however, the chemical systems that need to be considered contain on the order of Avodadro’s number (6.022 x 1023) of molecules. Even if only one reaction is possible, that reaction can occur many, many times in any system of practical size. The individual molecular events do not all occur at the same time. As a consequence, the composition of the system changes over time, and means of characterizing the composition are needed.\nReaction Engineering Basics always assumes that gas phase systems are ideal. For a pure (single component) gas Equation 1.3 is the equation of state, and Equation 1.4 is the equation of state for gas mixtures.\n\\[\nPV=nRT\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\\[\nPV=RT\\sum_i n_i\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics, liquids are incompressible and form ideal mixtures. As such, Equation 1.5 is the equation of state for a pure liquid and Equation 1.6 is the equation of state for a liquid mixture.\n\\[\n\\rho = \\text{constant}\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\n\\[\n\\rho = \\sum_i \\left(\\omega _i \\rho _i\\right)\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nConcentration, Equation 1.7, density, Equation 1.8, mole fraction, Equation 1.9, and mass fraction, Equation 1.10, are composition variables that can be used for either gas or liquid systems.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{n_i}{V}\n\\tag{1.7}\\]\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\n\\[\nx_i = \\frac{n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i\\left(n_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.9}\\]\n\\[\n\\omega _i = \\frac{m_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i \\left(m_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.10}\\]\nThe density is related to the concentrations as shown in Equation 1.11.\n\\[\n\\rho = \\sum _i \\left( M_iC_i \\right)\n\\tag{1.11}\\]\nFor gas phase systems, the partial pressure, Equation 1.12, is another composition variable.\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{n_iRT}{V} = C_iRT\n\\tag{1.12}\\]\nIn addition to being small, the chemical systems considered up to this point were closed systems. The discussion mentioned the reagents initially present in the system. Then it continued by discussing what was present in the system at later times. Chemical reactions also take place in open systems where reagents are continually entering the system as a feed stream and leaving it as a product stream. If a chemical reaction takes place in a steady-state flow system, the starting composition is the composition of the feed stream, and the ending composition is the composition of the product stream.\nIn closed systems, the moles of each of the species are natural variables to use to describe changes in composition. In an open, steady-state system, the composition changes between the entrance or inlet of the system and the outlet, but at any one point it is constant over time. In such a system, the molar flow rates of the species are natural variables to use to describe the changes. Reaction Engineering Basics uses variable symbols with dots over them to indicate flows. For example, \\(n_i\\), denotes the moles of reagent \\(i\\) while \\(\\dot n_i\\) represents the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\). (See Appendix C for a complete listing of the notation used in Reaction Engineering Basics.) Thus, open systems are described using Equations 1.13 through 1.19 instead of Equations 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, and 1.12.\n\\[\nP\\dot V=\\dot nRT\n\\tag{1.13}\\]\n\\[\nP\\dot V=RT\\sum_i \\dot n_i\n\\tag{1.14}\\]\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\tag{1.15}\\]\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{\\dot m}{\\dot V}\n\\tag{1.16}\\]\n\\[\nx_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i\\left(\\dot n_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.17}\\]\n\\[\n\\omega _i = \\frac{\\dot m_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i \\left(\\dot m_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.18}\\]\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot n_iRT}{\\dot V} = C_iRT\n\\tag{1.19}\\]\nIn large systems, it is quite possible that the numbers of molecules of each of the different reactants are not in stoichiometric proportion. If the forward reaction were to occur a sufficient number of times, one of the reactants would be completely used up while molecules of the other reactants still remained. The reactant that is completely used up is called the limiting reactant because the net number of times the forward reaction can occur is limited by the starting number of molecules of that reactant. The limiting reactant, or reactants if more than one would run out simultaneously, can be identified if you know the number of molecules or moles of each reactant that was present initially or in the feed. As shown in Equations 1.20 (for closed systems) and 1.21 (for open systems), the initial or starting number of moles of each reactant is divided by the magnitude of its stoichiometric coefficient. The resulting values might be referred to as the “stoichiometric equivalences” of the reactants. The reactant with the smallest stoichiometric equivalence is then the limiting reactant. If the resulting value is the same for all reactants, that means that the initial composition is a stoichiometric mixture and no reactant is limiting. If a reaction had 3 reactants with two having the same stoichiometric equivalence and the third having a greater value, then either or both of the reactants with the smaller value could be considered to be the limiting reactant.\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{lr,0}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{n_{nlr,0}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|}\n\\tag{1.20}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot n_{lr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{\\dot n_{nlr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|}\n\\tag{1.21}\\]\nExample 1.4.1 shows how to use the criterion presented here to identify the limiting reactant in a given reaction system.\n\n\n1.1.5 Classifying Reactions\nThere are a number of different ways of characterizing reactions. A few have already been mentioned. One being classification based on the number of reactants participating in the molecular reaction event. That classification differentiates unimolecular, bimolecular, termolecular and intramolecular reactions. Another classification based upon the molecular reaction event is whether the reaction is elementary (all bonds break and form simultaneously) or non-elementary (the bonds break and form sequentially). From a macroscopic perspective a non-elementary reaction appears to be occurring, but at the molecular level, two or more molecular reaction events are actually taking place. The third is a thermodynamic classification based on the heat of reaction whereby reactions are classified as exothermic or endothemic.\nAnother thermodynamic classification is based upon the equilibrium composition for a reaction. All molecular reaction events are reversible. If you start with reactant molecules, they can convert to product molecules, and if you start with product molecules they can convert to reactant molecules. This is known as the principle of microscopic reversibility. As a consequence, in a large reacting system, there will always be some reactant molecules present because some of the product molecules will be reacting to re-generate reactant molecules. Eventually chemical reaction equilibrium is reached and the composition will become constant. If the amount of the limiting reactant that remains when the system reaches equilibrium is negligibly small, the reaction is said to be irreversible. In contrast, if the amount of the limiting reactant that remains when the system reaches equilibrium is appreciable, the reaction is said to be reversible. It was noted previously that double arrows (\\(\\rightleftarrows\\)) in a chemical reaction expression may signify that the reaction is reversible.\nQuite often, two or more chemical reactions take place at the same time in a chemical system. In these cases, additional classification of groups of reactions is sometimes possible. When a group of reactions all have the same reactants, but different products, that group is called a set of parallel reactions. The general form of parallel reactions is shown in Reactions 1.22. An example of parallel reactions is the chlorination of toluene, Reactions 1.23. Toluene and chlorine are the reactants in all of those reactions, but the products differ. The first reaction produces ortho-chlorotoluene, the second produces meta-chlorotoluene, and the third produces para-chlorotoluene.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\rightarrow Y \\\\\nA \\rightarrow Z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.22}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_7H_8 + Cl_2 \\rightarrow o-C_7H_7Cl + HCl \\\\\nC_7H_8 + Cl_2 \\rightarrow m-C_7H_7Cl + HCl \\\\\nC_7H_8 + Cl_2 \\rightarrow p-C_7H_7Cl + HCl\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.23}\\]\nMultiple reactions can also occur as series reactions. This means that the reactions occur sequentially, in the sense that the product of one reaction is the reactant in another reaction, as shown in Reactions 1.24, where D is the product of the first reaction and the reactant in the second reaction. In series reactions, the intermediate product, D in the case of Reactions 1.24, is often the more valuable, or desired, product, and the final product, U, is less valuable or undesired. An example of series reactions is the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, Reactions 1.25. Cyclohexadiene is produced in the first reaction and reacts in the second reaction to yield cyclohexene. Then the cyclohexene reacts in the third reaction to produce benzene.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\rightarrow D \\\\\nD \\rightarrow U\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.24}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_6H_{12} \\rightarrow C_6H_{10} + H_2 \\\\\nC_6H_{10} \\rightarrow C_6H_8 + H_2 \\\\\nC_6H_8 \\rightarrow C_6H_6 + H_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.25}\\]\nA third kind of multiple reaction network involves series-parallel reactions. They are a kind of hybrid of series reactions and parallel reactions. From the perspective of one reactant, the group of reactions appear to be series reactions while from the perspective of the other reactant, it appears to be a parallel reaction network. Looking at the general example in Reactions 1.26, D is a product of the first reaction and it is a reactant in the second reaction. At the same time, B is a reactant in both reactions. So from the perspective of A being converted to D which is subsequently converted to U, it looks like a series reaction network but from B’s perspective it looks like a parallel reaction network. Reactions 1.27 is an example of a three-reaction series-parallel network. Methane is converted in parallel, while mono-methyl, di-methyl- and tri-methylamine are generated sequentially.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA + B \\rightarrow D + Y \\\\\nD + B \\rightarrow U + Z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.26}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nNH_3 + CH_4 \\rightarrow NH_2CH_3 + H_2 \\\\\nNH_2CH_3 + CH_4 \\rightarrow NH\\left(CH_3\\right)_2 + H_2 \\\\\nNH\\left(CH_3\\right)_2 + CH_4 \\rightarrow N\\left(CH_3\\right)_3 + H_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.27}\\]\nPolymerization reactions are another type of multiple reaction network. Whole books and whole courses are devoted to polymerization reactions, so there’s lots more to it that what’s presented here. For present purposes, it can be noted that polymerization reactions share some of the characteristics of series-parallel reactions. In a simple example, Reactions 1.28, one reactant participates in parallel. It is called the monomer, and is represented here as M. The difference is that there may be thousands of sequential reactions. As a consequence, there are many, many products, differing in the number of monomer units they were made from. There isn’t one desired product, but often the goal is to produce predominantly products where the value of \\(n\\) falls in a certain range. Ethylene polymerization to produce polyethylene, Reaction 1.29, is an example of a polymerization reaction.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM + M \\rightarrow M_2 \\\\\nM + M_2 \\rightarrow M_3 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nM + M_{n-1} \\rightarrow M_n\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.28}\\]\n\\[\nn C_2H_4 \\rightarrow \\; -\\left(CH_2-CH_2\\right)_n-\n\\tag{1.29}\\]",

    "section": "1.2 Chemical Reactors",
    "text": "1.2 Chemical Reactors\nDefining a chemical system involves identifying or specifying physical boundaries and describing chemical events that happen within those boundaries. In Reaction Engineering Basics the boundaries typically will encompass chemical process equipment, and chemical reactions will be among the events occurring within those boundaries. The term reactor often refers to a physical container, such as a flask, beaker, tank, pipe, etc., within which one or more chemical reactions occur. In that case, the physical walls of the reactor define the boundaries of the chemical system.\nA reactor does not have to be a piece of apparatus, though. The human liver can be modeled as a chemical reactor . Neither does it have to possess physical walls. The earth’s atmosphere can be modeled as a chemical reactor. Many of the principles presented in this book can be used in the development of models for systems like the human liver (Mitchell and Mendes 2013) and the earth’s atmosphere(Yang, Lu, and Hu 2013). Nonetheless, the reactors considered in Reaction Engineering Basics will be physical containers in almost all cases. When biological reactions take place within them, the name chemostat or fermentor is sometimes used instead of “reactor.”\nTwo types of reactors are the primary focus of Reaction Engineering Basics. One is a vessel wherein the contents are perfectly mixed. These are commonly referred to as stirred tank reactors. Stirred tank reactors may be open (that is have material flowing in and/or out) or they may be closed with no material flow in or out. The other type of reactor is a cylindrical tube within which the fluid velocity is constant across the tube diameter. Flow of that type is commonly called plug flow, and the reactors are called plug flow reactors.\nReaction Engineering Basics examines ideal stirred tank reactors. The most important feature of ideal stirred tank reactors is that the contents are perfectly mixed at all times. If the contents of an ideal stirred tank reactor are sampled simutaneously at multiple locations within the stirred tank, the temperature, pressure and composition of every sample will be the same. Figure 1.3 presents a schematic representation of a closed stirred tank reactor that exchanges heat with an external heat exchange fluid. Chapter 6 describes three variants of stirred tank reactors (batch, semi-batch and continuous) and Appendix H derives equations used to model them. The volume containing the reacting fluid and the volume containing the heat exchange fluid are separated by a wall through which the fluids exchange heat. In Reaction Engineering Basics the heat exchange fluid is always assumed to be perfectly mixed, and the heat exchange fluid is assumed to exchange either sensible heat or latent heat, but not both. Appendix E describes heat exchange with stirred tanks in a little more detail and also presents equations used to model it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A closed (batch) stirred tank reactor. The reacting fluid is represented by the turquoise shading and the heat exchange fluid by yellow shading. The wall through which heat is exchanged is shaded red.\n\n\n\nThe ideal tubular reactors considered in Reaction Engineering Basics are always assumed to be cylindrical with a constant diameter. The fluid in an ideal tubular reactor is assumed to display plug flow. Figure 1.4 shows a schematic representation of a tubular reactor with heat exchange. Unlike stirred tanks, the temperature, pressure and composition change along the length of a plug-flow reactor. The same assumptions about perfect mixing of the heat exchange fluid and exchange of either sensible heat or latent* heat by that fluid are used. The wall through which heat is exchanged is always the wall of the tubular reactor. Equations for modeling plug-flow reactors are derived in Appendix H, and equations for modeling tubular reactor heat exchange are presented in Appendix E.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: A plug-flow reactor. The reacting fluid is represented by blue shading. The gradient in the shading indicates that the temperature, pressure and composition change along the length of the cylindrical reactor. Heat can be exchanged through the wall of the reactor which is shaded in red. The perfectly mixed heat exchange fluid is represented by yellow shading.\n\n\n\nChemical processes, and, by extension, chemical reactors, can be classified in a few ways. One form of classification is based upon whether the reactor exchanges heat with its surroundings. If no energy is added to or removed from the reactor other that that associated with input and output flow streams, the reactor is said to be adiabatic. If energy is added or removed, the process is non-adiabatic.\nAnother form of classification is based upon variables describing the process being constant. If the temperature is uniform (the same everywhere) throughout the reactor and constant while the process occurs, the process is said to be isothermal. Similarly, if the pressure throughout the reactor is uniform and constant while the process occurs, the reactor is said to be isobaric. A process is isochoric if the system volume is constant while the process occurs.\nA third form of classification is based upon temporal (time) variations. If, at each location within the reactor, the temperature, pressure and composition are constant over time, the reactor is said to operate at steady-state. In a steady-state reactor, the temperature, pressure and composition may vary from location to location within the reactor, but at each location they are constant over time. If the temperature, pressure or composition vary over time at any location with a reactor, then it is called transient operation.",

    "text": "1.3 Reaction Engineering\nReaction engineering is an important, exciting and engaging field of study. It is important because it is used to produce many, many things we use every day (fuels, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, processed foods, plastics, computer chips, etc.). It is exciting because it is expected to play a major role in meeting several of the grand challenges facing mankind (“NAE GRAND CHALLENGES FOR ENGINEERING” 2017). Specifically, there is a role for reaction engineering in making solar energy economical, developing carbon sequestration methods, managing the nitrogen cycle, providing access to clean water, and perhaps also in some aspects of providing energy from fusion, engineering better medicines, and engineering the tools of scientific discovery. It is not only engaging because reaction engineers can work to solve important, meaningful problems, but also because practitioners can be highly creative when solving reaction engineering problems.\nChemical reaction engineering is a sub-discipline of chemical engineering that focuses upon processes involving one or more chemical reactions. It incorporates the modeling, optimization, design and operation of chemical reactors. That modeling involves the integration of fluid flow, mass and heat transfer and chemical reaction kinetics to mathematically describe reactor systems.\nReaction engineering models allow reaction engineers and others to understand reaction processes and predict their behavior before investing time and money in building them. The models reveal necessary equipment size, energy requirements, wastes that are co-produced, and so on. Using them, the procedures for safely starting, operating and shutting down processes can be specified. The models can also be used to calculate the economics of building and operating processes.\nReaction engineers must be creative and need skills beyond building models. They must be able to create new processes and adapt existing processes to make new products while satisfying safety, environmental and economic constraints. Reaction engineers must be able to locate or generate data required by their models and they need the ability to validate and revise their models using experimental data. Reaction engineers must function effectively as members of multidisciplinary teams that include experts in business, finance, health, safety, environmental and regulatory compliance, logistics, operations, chemistry and others.\nReaction Engineering Basics offers an introduction to reaction engineering. While it is limited in scope, it illustrates many of the kinds of problems that reaction engineers encounter. Chemical kinetics is a sub-discipline of chemistry that focuses upon the rates of chemical reactions. Reaction Engineering Basics introduces essential aspects of chemical kinetics, in particular, the generation and analysis of data for the purpose of generating rate expressions for chemical reactions. Appendix B presents an overview of knowledge that readers of Reaction Engineering Basics are expected to possess. Solving reaction engineering models requires knowledge from the field of mathematics. Reaction Engineering Basics assumes model equations will be solved numerically. Appendices I through K present an overview of numerical methods that are commonly used to solve reaction engineering model equations.",

If equal volumes of carbon monoxide and air at equal temperature and pressure are mixed and flow into a chemical reactor, which reactant is limiting?\n\\[\n2 CO + O_2 \\rightarrow 2 CO_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What Might an Expert be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem asks me to identify the limiting reactant, and that means that I will need to use either Equation 1.20 or Equation 1.21. It also states that CO and air flow into the reactor. That means it is an open reactor, and Equation 1.21 should be used to identify the limiting reactant. The reactants and their stoichiometric coefficients can be determined from the balanced chemical reaction which is given as reaction (1).\n\n\n\nLimiting Reactant Criterion\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot n_{lr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{\\dot n_{nlr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nReactants: CO and O2\nStoichiometric Coefficients of the Reactants: \\(\\nu_{CO} = -2\\) and \\(\\nu_{O_2} = -1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem does not give me enough information to calculate the inlet molar flow rates. However, since it doesn’t give any extensive quantities, I can assume the inlet volumetric flow rate of CO or air as a basis. (According to the problem statement they are equal.) I still can’t calculate the inlet molar flow rates, though, because I don’t know the temperature or pressure. However, I do know that the gases are ideal, so I can try re-writing equation (2) in terms of volumetric flow rates.\n\n\n\nUsing the ideal gas law the molar flow rates in equation (2) can be expressed in terms of the volumetric flow rates.\n\\[\n\\frac{P\\dot V_{lr,in}}{RT\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|}&lt; \\frac{P\\dot V_{nlr,in}}{RT\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|}\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(\\frac{RT}{P}\\) yields a limiting reactant criterion in terms of inlet volumetric flow rates, equation (3).\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot V_{lr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{\\dot V_{nlr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nBasis: \\(\\dot V_{CO,in}\\) = 1 L s-1.\nAccording to the problem statement the inlet volumetric flow rates of air and CO are equal, so \\(\\dot V_{\\text{air},in}\\) = 1 L s-1.\nAssuming that air is 21% O2 and 79% other non-reactive gases (predominantly N2) allows calculation of the inlet volumetric flow rate of O2, equation (4). At that point the stoichiometric equivalences of CO and O2 can be calculated, equations (5) and (6).\n\\[\n\\dot V_{O_2,in} = 0.21 \\dot V_{\\text{air},in} = 0.21 \\text{ L s}^{-1} \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot V_{CO,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{CO} \\right|} = \\frac{1 \\text{ L s}^{-1}}{\\left|-2\\right|} = 0.5 \\text{ L s}^{-1} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot V_{O_2,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{O_2} \\right|} = \\frac{0.21 \\text{ L s}^{-1}}{\\left|-1\\right|} = 0.21 \\text{ L s}^{-1} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric equivalence of O2 is smaller than that of CO, so O2 is the limiting reactant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are other ways to solve this problem. In the solution presented here, the volumetric flow rate of CO was chosen as a basis for the calculations. An alternative approach would be to choose the molar flow rate of air or CO as a basis. Doing so is left as an exercise for the reader.",

    "text": "2.1 Ethics\nMost engineering professional societies and many engineering schools have set forth codes of ethics, and many of the professionals who practice reaction engineering are members of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). The AIChE Code of Ethics (American Institute of Chemical Engineers 2012) is as follows.\nAll 11 expectations of the AIChE Code of Ethics are important. A few of them are particularly relevant for reaction engineers. Holding paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and protecting the environment is discussed later in this chapter. The second tenet, advising employers if you think your work can affect others’ health or safety is essential. As an example, suppose a process you are operating produces an aqueous toxic waste stream. That waste stream is purified, and the resulting purified water is discharged into a stream. If you learn that the purification system has not been operating properly and, consequently, contaminated water has been discharged into the stream, it is essential that you report this to your employer. If your employer takes no action, you should consider further disclosure.\nThe seventh and ninth expectations can also be relevant. This book presents an introduction to reaction engineering. There are many aspects of the field that it does not touch upon. If you intend to pursue reaction engineering as a career, there is much more you need to learn. You should continue to build your reaction engineering competence. Until you have learned more, you should not attempt engage in reaction engineering of systems that do not conform to the assumptions used in this book.\nThis book is not about ethics, or even reaction engineering ethics. Nonetheless, this chapter has been included because every engineer should be aware of codes of ethics that have been developed for their field. Before you are confronted with an issue of ethics, it is useful to know what you should do, and to have thought about and committed to responding in an ethical manner. Establishing personal principles of ethical behavior now, and sticking with them in small matters, will be beneficial should larger ethical issues arise in the future.",

    "text": "2.2 Safety\nAccording to the AIChE Code of Ethics the most important ethical responsibilities (the one to be held paramount) are the safety, health and welfare of people and the protection of the environment. Reactive chemical processes present risk with respect to all of these responsibilities. While not intended nor desired, explosions and release of toxic chemicals can occur resulting in deaths, injury, property damage and environmental contamination. Reaction engineers must always be aware of such possibilities and must do all they can to prevent them.\nMuch can be learned from the U. S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB), a federal agency that investigates industrial chemical accidents (“U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board  CSB” n.d.). As an example, “CSB Safety Video: Reactive Hazards” (U. S. Chemical Safety Board n.d.) describes four chemical reaction accidents. In addition to describing how and why the accident occurred, the video offers a number of safety recommendations related to reactive processes.\nThe first accident was the result of a change in process operation. It involved the highly exothermic polymerization of an acrylic polymer. The company had operated the process safely for years in batches of fixed size. An order was received for an amount of polymer 12% greater than the standard batch size. When the company attempted to manufacture the requested amount in a single batch, the cooling system was unable to remove the generated heat, and the reactor exploded. One person died and 14 others were injured.\nA twelve percent increase does not seem excessive. Nonetheless, it should not have been assumed that the batch size could be increased by 12% without affecting the process. Ethics would dictate that the consequences of this change should have been thoroughly investigated before making a decision to increase the batch size.\nThe second accident was the indirect result of an equipment failure. A polymerization reactor was used to produce hot polymer being fed to an extruder. During start-up, the extruder failed and the hot polymer was diverted to a storage tank. Too much time was spent trying to fix the extruder, so that the storage tank was overfilled. The excess polymer blocked the pressure gauge and the vent. As a result, workers did not know that the tank was under high pressure, and when they attempted to unbolt the cover, it blew off. As it blew off, the cover broke pipes, resulting in a fire. Three workers were killed.\nThe third accident was the result of improper scale-up of a chemical reactor. A reaction had been studied and operated safely in a 30 gallon test reactor. When the company scaled up to a 4000 gallon production reactor, they failed to realize that additional cooling was necessary. The production reactor exploded and released toxic chemicals into the air. Two hundred families living nearby had to be evacuated. One hundred fifty-four people had to be treated due to exposure to the chemicals.\nThe last example involved a leaking valve that the operators believed to be closed. Ultimately this resulted in a explosion that threw a 35 foot section of a tower completely off the chemical site. Another chunk of the tower hit a storage tank setting it ablaze. Shrapnel landed close to nearby tanks, one containing crude oil and the other, anhydrous ammonia. Had any shrapnel hit those tanks, the effects would have been even more dire.\nThese accidents have been described here to drive home the point that the highest ethical standards must be used when dealing with reactive processes. None of these accidents were desired nor expected. Some were caused by human error and others by a combination of equipment failure and not anticipating and planning for potential disruption of process conditions.\nThe CSB video (U. S. Chemical Safety Board n.d.) gives a number of recommendations that are worth repeating here. They apply equally to large industrial facilities and to small research laboratories.\n\nThose responsible for a chemical process must have a thorough understanding of the chemistry under designed operating conditions and under all foreseeable abnormal conditions. Multiple sources of information on chemical processes should be consulted and specialized testing should be conducted, if necessary, before operating reactive processes. Indeed, the CSB found that over 90% of serious accidents involve hazards that have already been described in publicly available literature.\nDetailed operating procedures should be developed and training programs to teach those procedures should be implemented. Potential hazards must be communicated to anyone associated with the operation or maintenance of reactive processes. Appropriate pressure relief and other safeguards need to be designed into the process.\nThe effects of even small changes to process conditions should be thoroughly studied before they are implemented, and the implementation of any changes must be carefully managed.\nFacilities need to plan for possible accidents, including evacuation drills and emergency response exercises. There should be well-rehearsed evacuation plans for facilities where reactive chemical processes operate. There should also be regular emergency response exercises. When appropriate, local law enforcement, firefighters and other first responders should be involved in such exercises.\n\nAs with the preceding section on ethics, the safety information presented here barely scratches the surface. Hopefully it is sufficient to have created an awareness of the importance of incorporating safety in every aspect of reaction engineering.\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers. 2012. “Code of Ethics.” https://www.aiche.org/about/governance/policies/code-ethics.\n\n\nU.

    "title": "3  Measures of Reaction Progress",
    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Describing Single-Reaction Systems\nConsider a closed system that initially contains a mixture of reagents. Let \\(N_{i,0}\\) represent the number of molecules of reagent \\(i\\) in that mixture. Suppose that there is only one reaction, \\(j\\), that can occur, and further suppose that in the reaction expression, the stoichiometric coefficients, \\(\\nu _{i,j}\\), equal the number of \\(i\\) molecules that participate each time molecular reaction event \\(j\\) occurs. If \\(N_{j,net}\\) is the net number of times molecular reaction event \\(j\\) has occurred, then the change in the number of molecules of \\(i\\) is equal to \\(\\nu _{i,j} N_{j,net}\\). (Remember, if \\(i\\) is a reactant, its stoichiometric coefficient will be negative, so the change in the number of molecules will be negative, and the number of \\(i\\) molecules will decrease, as it should. Similarly, if \\(i\\) is a product, the stoichiometric coefficient will be positive and the number of \\(i\\) molecules will increase.)\n\\[\nN_i - N_{i,0} = \\nu _{i,j} N_{j,net}\n\\]\nIn real-world systems, the number of molecules is huge, and it is more convenient to work with moles. Dividing both sides of the equation by Avogadro’s number, \\(N_{Av}\\), and rearranging, gives an expression for the moles of \\(i\\) at any later time, given the number of moles of \\(i\\) at the start of the process.\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\nu _{i,j} \\frac{N_{j,net}}{N_{Av}}\n\\]\nThe net number of reaction events divided by Avogadro’s number is called the true extent of reaction j, \\(\\Xi_j\\), Equation 3.1. Substitution in the preceding equation yields an expression for the moles of \\(i\\), Equation 3.2.\n\\[\n\\Xi_j = \\frac{N_{j,net}}{N_{Av}}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\nu _{i,j} \\Xi_j\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nThat was for a closed system. For an open, steady-state system, the change occurs between the point where the moles enter the process and the point where they leave. When talking about material entering and leaving, it makes more sense to use molar flow rates instead of moles. Doing so leads to Equation 3.3 for an open, steady-state system. It turns out that these equations are accurate no matter how the reaction expression is written, as long as it is balanced. That is, the stoichiometric coefficients in the reaction expression do not have to equal the number of molecules that participate in the molecular reaction event, but the reaction expression does have to be properly balanced. In that case, it is preferable to define the apparent extent of reaction, \\(\\xi_j\\), as the net number of times the reaction, as written, occurs and to use the apparent extent of reaction in Equation 3.1 and Equation 3.2 instead of the true extent of reaction. Uses of the apparent extent of reaction are illustrated in Examples 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, and 3.4.4.\n\\[\n\\dot n_i = \\dot n_{i,0} + \\nu _i \\dot \\Xi_j\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nIt’s also important to know that the extent of reaction is an extensive quantity. For a closed system it has units of moles, and for an open, steady-state system it has units of moles per time. In the latter case, the extent is related to the net number of times that the molecular reaction event occurs per unit time. Notice that all of the variable symbols in Equation 3.3 except the stoichiometric coefficient have dots over them, indicating they are flow quantities.\nThere’s a second quantity that is very useful for describing how far a reaction has progressed. It’s called the conversion. It can be either a fraction or a percentage, and it only applies to reactants. Quite simply, the fractional conversion of reactant \\(i\\), denoted as \\(f_i\\), is just the fraction of the starting amount of \\(i\\) that has reacted. It is an intensive quantity, and it does not have any units. The defining equations for closed and open, steady state systems are shown in Equation 3.4 and Equation 3.5. It doesn’t make sense to talk about how much product was converted, so again, conversion only applies to reactants.\n\\[\nf_i=\\frac{n_{i,0}-n_i}{n_{i,0}}\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\n\\[\nf_i=\\frac{\\dot{n}_{i,in}-\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{n}_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nIf the starting composition is stoichiometric, then the fractional conversion of every reactant will be the same. However, if one reactant is present in excess, its fractional conversion will be smaller than other reactants and will never reach 100%. For this reason, when the starting composition is not stoichiometric, it is preferred (but not required) that the conversion be specified for the limiting reactant because then the conversion will range from zero to 100%, assuming the reaction is irreversible. Of course, if the reaction is reversible, then even the limiting reactant will have a maximum conversion that is less than 100% because the system will reach equilibrium with measurable amounts of the reactants still remaining. The use of fractional conversion is illustrated in Example 3.4.1 and Example 3.4.4.\nIf it is desired to have a conversion that always ranges from 0 to 100%, the fraction of equilibrium conversion, Equation 3.6 for a closed system or Equation 3.7 for an open, steady-state system, can be used. The fraction of equilibrium conversion, \\(g_i\\) is just the actual conversion relative to the conversion at equilibrium, so it, too, is an intensive variable. The vertical bar in these equations means “evaluated at”, and “eq” is shorthand for equilibrium, so together the vertical bar followed by a subscripted “eq” means the quantity it follows is evaluated at equilibrium. (See Appendix C for a complete list of the sign conventions and notation used in Reaction Engineering Basics.)\n\\[\ng_i = \\frac{f_i}{f_{i,eq}}= \\frac{\\frac{n_{i,0} - n_i}{n_{i,0}}}{\\frac{n_{i,0} -  n_{i,eq}}{n_{i,0}}} = \\frac{n_{i,0} - n_i}{n_{i,0} - n_{i,eq}}\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\n\\[\ng_i = \\frac{\\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i}{\\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_{i,eq}}\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nThe fraction of equilibrium conversion may not be convenient to use. For one thing, in order to use it, you have to do additional calculations to determine what the conversion is at equilibrium. In addition, the conversion at equilibrium changes with temperature which means a change in temperature would change the fraction of equilibrium conversion even if no reaction took place.",

    "section": "3.2 Describing Multiple-Reaction Systems",
    "text": "3.2 Describing Multiple-Reaction Systems\nThe preceding section considered systems where only one reaction was taking place. When multiple reactions are taking place in the system, additional or different variables are needed to fully describe the reacting system. Before considering such variables it is necessary to review what is meant by “mathematically independent” equations, or in this case, mathematically independent reactions.\nTo understand why, consider Reactions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. Only two of those three reactions are mathematically independent. The third is a linear combination of the others. This can be seen by noting, for example, that the third reaction is the sum of the first two. Put differently, the third reaction is equal to the net effect of the first two reactions occurring sequentially.\n\\[\nCO + 3 H_2 \\rightarrow CH_4 + H_2O\n\\tag{3.8}\\]\n\\[\nCO + H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + H_2\n\\tag{3.9}\\]\n\\[\n2 CO + 2 H_2 \\rightarrow CH_4 + CO_2\n\\tag{3.10}\\]\nIf a system initially contained a mixture of CO and H2, and then at some later time it was found to contain CO, H2, CH4, H2O and CO2, it would not be possible to know how much of the CH4 was produced by Reaction 3.8 and how much was produced by Reaction 3.10. Similarly, it would not be possible to know how much of the CO2 had been produced by Reaction 3.9 and how much was produced by Reaction 3.10. It is impossible to calculate the true extents of all three reactions if only the initial and final compositions of the system are known.\nIn general, when some of the reactions occurring in a system are linear combinations of other reactions, then a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions captures all of the stoichiometry. A complete mathematically independent subset is a group of reactions taken from all possible reactions where (1) none of the reactions in the subset are a linear combination of other reactions in the subset, and (2) each reaction that is not in the subset is a linear combination of the reactions that are in the subset. Consequently, for a closed system, the change in the number of moles of any reagent, \\(i\\), is equal to the sum of the apparent extents, \\(\\xi _{j^\\prime}\\) of the \\(j^{\\prime}\\) mathematically independent reactions multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficient, \\(\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}\\), of reagent \\(i\\) in independent reaction \\(j^{\\prime}\\). This leads to Equation 3.11 for a closed system or to Equation 3.12 for an open, steady-state system. In those equations \\(j^{\\prime}\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place in the system. Note that Equation 3.11 and Equation 3.12 also apply to a system where only one reaction is taking place. In that case, the summation reduces to a single term. Example 3.4.3 illustrates the identification of a complete mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place in a system, and Example 3.4.4 illustrates the use of the apparent extents of those reactions in the calculation of system composition.\n\\[\n\\Delta n_i = n_i - n_{i,0} = \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{3.11}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_i = \\dot n_{i,in} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\dot \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{3.12}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system.\nIt is important to recognize that the extent of reaction, \\(\\Xi_j\\), has physical significance. It is the number times that molecular reaction event \\(j\\) has occurred, expressed in moles. In contrast, the apparent extent of reaction, \\(\\xi_{j^\\prime}\\), does not have any physical significance. It is a mathematical construct that is useful for characterizing the composition of a reacting system. Indeed, for a given multiple reaction system, there are typically more than one complete, mathematically independent subsets, and any one of those subsets can be used in Equation 3.11 or Equation 3.12.\nIn order to use Equation 3.11 or Equation 3.12 it is necessary to determine the number of mathematically independent reactions and then to find at least one such subset. Appendix B presents a very brief and succinct description of how to do this, and Example 3.4.3 illustrates doing so.\nIf the number of mathematically independent reactions is \\(N\\), then \\(N\\) reaction progress variables are needed to fully characterize the system, given its initial composition. Thus, the apparent extents of a complete, mathematically independent subset of all possible reactions are sufficient to calculate the composition of a system, given its initial composition.\nThe conversion can be used when describing reaction progress of multiple reaction systems, but it must be used in conjunction with additional measures of reaction progress to fully specify the system composition. When using the conversion as a reaction progress variable in a multiple reaction system, it is necessary to specify the reactant it applies to. Furthermore, that reactant must be initially present in the system. As an example, again consider Reactions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. H2O is a reactant in Reaction 3.9, but it might not initially be present in the system. Initially the system might only contain CO and H2. H2O would be generated by Reaction 3.8 and then could participate as a reactant in Reaction 3.9. If one tried to calculate the conversion of H2O using Equation 3.4, the denominator would equal zero, leading to an infinite conversion. Therefore when multiple reactions are taking place, conversion is only defined for reactants that are initially present.\nYield is a reaction progress variable that specifies the amount of one particular product relative to the starting amount of one particular reactant. There are a few different ways to define yield, making it important to know which definition is being used whenever a yield is specified. When multiple reactions are occurring, it is very often true that some of the products are more desirable or valuable than other products. In some such systems, the desired product, \\(D\\), is produced through a combination of reaction steps where it isn’t possible to identify a stoichiometric relationship between \\(D\\) and any one reactant, \\(i\\). Under these circumstances it is common to define the yield as shown in Equation 3.13 for a closed system and in Equation 3.14 for an open, steady-state process. Example 3.4.4 illustrates the use of yield as a reaction progress variable.\n\\[\nY_{D/i} = \\frac{n_D}{n_{i,0}}\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\n\\[\nY_{D/i} = \\frac{\\dot n_D}{\\dot n_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) where \\(D\\) is a product and \\(i\\) is a reactant.\nIn other reaction systems, the desired product, \\(D\\), is produced from reactant, \\(i\\), in only one reaction, \\(j\\). When this is true, it may be preferable to account for the stoichiometry as shown in Equation 3.15 and Equation 3.16. By doing so, the resulting yield can be expressed as a percentage that ranges from 0 to 100% (assuming reaction \\(j\\) is irreversible).\n\\[\nY^\\prime_{D/i} = \\frac{\\nu_{i,j}}{\\nu_{D,j}}\\frac{n_D}{n_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.15}\\]\n\\[\nY^\\prime_{D/i} = \\frac{\\nu_{i,j}}{\\nu_{D,j}}\\frac{\\dot n_D}{\\dot n_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) where \\(D\\) is a product and \\(i\\) is a reactant.\nWhile yield relates the amount of a product to the amount of a reactant, selectivity is a reaction progress variable that relates the amount of one product or group of products to a different product or group of products. If there is one desirable product, \\(D\\), and one undesirable product, \\(U\\), the selectivity for \\(D\\) relative to \\(U\\) can be defined as shown in Equation 3.17 and Equation 3.18. In other instances the selectivity of interest might involve groups of products. Examples include parafins vs. olefins, napthenes vs. aromatics or hydrocarbons with 6 or more carbon atoms (sometimes denotes as C6+) vs. hydrocarbons with 5 or fewer carbon atoms (sometimes denoted as C5-). Example 3.4.1 and Example 3.4.4 illustrate the use of selectivity.\n\\[\nS_{D/U} = \\frac{n_D}{n_U}\n\\tag{3.17}\\]\n\\[\nS_{D/U} = \\frac{\\dot n_D}{\\dot n_U}\n\\tag{3.18}\\]\nBoth yield and selectivity can be used as overall measures or as instantaneous measures. The overall yield or selectivity is the value at the end of a closed process or at the outlet from an open, steady-state process, as defined in Equations 3.17 and 3.18. In a closed process, the yield or selectivity will typically change over time, and in an open, steady-state process it will vary with position within the reactor. An instantaneous yield or selectivity can be defined for that time or position within the reactor. The instantaneous yield or selectivity is related to the rates at which the amounts of the reagents are changing. Reaction rates are defined in Chapter 4, so defining equations for the instantaneous yield or selectivity will be presented in that chapter.",

    "text": "3.3 Mole Tables\nA mole table is a convenient tool for summarizing the stoichiometric relationships among the chemical species present in a system. Mole tables can be particularly helpful for those just learning reaction engineering. They are useful when calculating the composition of a system, given its initial composition, and also when converting from one composition variable (concentration, mole fraction, partial pressure, moles, etc.) to another.\nA mole table has three columns, as can be seen in Table 3.1. The first column lists each of the chemical species that are present in the system, including any inert reagents that do not participate in any chemical reactions. The second column lists the initial moles (for a closed system) or inlet molar flow rate (for an open, steady-state system) of each species. The third column lists expressions for the moles or molar flow rates at any later time or at any point beyond the inlet to an open system in terms of the apparent extents of reaction. In other words, each row in the third column contains either Equation 3.11 or Equation 3.12 for that row’s species, with the summation expanded and the values of the stoichiometric coefficients substituted. A final row in the table is for total moles or molar flow rate. It lists the sum of the initial values in the second column and the sum of the expressions for moles at any later time in the third column.

Reaction (2) also takes place at the operating conditions of 1 atm and 150 °C. The process starts with 90% ethane and 10% air (you may take air to contain 79% N2 and 21% O2) and ends with a 50% conversion of O2 and a selectivity of 3 C2H4/CO2.

The completion of reaction engineering assignments often requires the calculation of the composition of a system given information about its initial composition together with some measure of how much reaction has taken place. I often refer to this kind of task as a reaction progress task.\nAlmost inevitably, the completion of a reaction progress task entails first using the given information about the initial composition to calculate the initial molar amounts (for closed systems) or inlet molar flow rates (for open, steady-state systems) of every reagent present in the system. The next step involves using these initial amounts and the given measure of reaction progress to calculate the apparent extent of reaction. The amounts of all of the reagents corresponding to the given measure of reaction progress then can be calculated using the known initial composition and the apparent extent of reaction. Finally the desired quantities, e. g. concentrations, mole fractions, partial pressures, etc., corresponding to the given measure of reaction progress can be calculated using their defining equations.\nI like to begin by summarizing the information provided in the problem statement. As I started to do so, I noticed that the system initially contains 10% air. Multiplying that 10% by the fraction of O2 found in air (21%), gives the mole fraction of O2. The same is true for N2, except its fraction in air is 79%.\n\n\n\nGiven: \\(P = 1 \\text{ atm}\\), \\(T = 150 \\text{ °C}\\), \\(f_{O_2} = 0.5\\), \\(S_{C_2H_4/CO_2} = 3.0\\)\nGiven Initial Composition: \\(y_{C_2H_6,0}\\) = 0.9, \\(y_{O_2,0}\\) = 0.21(0.1), \\(y_{N_2,0}\\) = 0.79(0.1)\nRequested: \\(y_{CO_2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nA mole table can be a useful tool when performing reaction progress tasks, particularly when one is just beginning to study reaction engineering. This problem tells me to construct a mole table, so I’ll do that first. I know that when I construct a mole table, I’ll need to use Equation 3.11. I also know that to use Equation 3.11, I need to identify a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions that are taking place. Since there are only two reactions taking place in this problem, I can do that by inspection. The reactions produce different products, so there is no way that one can be a simple multiple of the other, and therefore reactions (1) and (2) are mathematically independent. Consequently, in Equation 3.11, \\(j^\\prime\\) will range from 1 to 2.\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad n_{i,0} + \\nu_{i,1} \\xi_1 + \\nu_{i,2} \\xi_2\n\\]\nWith that knowledge, I can construct the mole table. There are six reagents in this system: C2H6, O2, C2H4, H2O, CO2, and N2. The first column of the mole table lists one of these species in each row. A row is added at the bottom listing “Total.” The second column lists variables representing the initial molar amounts of each reagent. I can use \\(n_{\\text{total},0}\\) to represent \\(n_{C_2H_6,0}\\) + \\(n_{O_2,0}\\) + \\(n_{C_2H_4,0}\\) + \\(n_{H_2O,0}\\) + \\(n_{CO_2,0}\\) + \\(n_{N_2,0}\\).\nThe equation above can then be used to construct the entries in each row of the third column of the mole table. For example, the stoichiometric coefficient of C2H6 in reaction (1), \\(\\nu_{C_2H_6,1}\\), is -2, and its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction (2), \\(\\nu_{C_2H_6,2}\\), is also equal to -2. Letting \\(i\\) equal C2H6, substituting these values, and expanding the summation yields an expression for the moles of C2H6 at any later time.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn_{C_2H_6} &= n_{C_2H_6,0} + \\nu_{C_2H_6,1} \\xi_1 + \\nu_{C_2H_6,2} \\xi_2 \\\\\n&= n_{C_2H_6,0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 2 \\xi_2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn a similar manner, the rows in the third column corresponding to each of the species are completed. For the last row, the expressions in all the other rows are simply added together to complete the mole table.\n\n\n\nA mole table for this system is presented in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Mole Table for Example 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nInitial Amount\nLater Amount\n\n\n\n\nC2H6\n\\(n_{C_2H_6,0}\\)\n\\(n_{C_2H_6,0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 2 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nO2\n\\(n_{O_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{O_2,0} - \\xi_1 - 7 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nC2H4\n\\(n_{C_2H_4,0}\\)\n\\(n_{C_2H_4,0} + 2 \\xi_1\\)\n\n\nH2O\n\\(n_{H_2O,0}\\)\n\\(n_{H_2O,0} + 2 \\xi_1 + 6 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nCO2\n\\(n_{CO_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CO_2,0} + 4 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nN2\n\\(n_{N_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{N_2,0}\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0}\\)\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0} + \\xi_1 + \\xi_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem directs me to use Table 3.1 to calculate the final mole fraction of CO2. Looking at the mole table and at the given information, I can see that there is no way to calculate the initial molar amounts that appear in the mole table. However, quantity that is provided in the problem statement is an intensive quantity. When no extensive quantities are provided, I can assume the value of any one extensive quantity and use it as the basis for my calculations. Since the initial mole fractions are given, it makes sense to choose the total moles initially present in the system as a basis.\n\n\n\nBasis: \\(n_{\\text{total},0} = 1 \\text{ mol}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I noted above, the first step in completing a reacton progress task is to calculate the initial molar amounts. Having chosen a basis, this is straightforward. The initial percentages of ethane (90%) and air (10%) add up to 100%, meaning that there was no C2H4, H2O, or CO2 initially present. The total initial moles can then be calculated.\n\n\n\nNecessary Equations\n\\[\nn_{C_2H_6,0} = y_{C_2H_6,0} n_{\\text{total},0} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{O_2,0} = y_{O_2,0} n_{\\text{total},0} \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{N_2,0} = y_{N_2,0} n_{\\text{total},0} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{C_2H_4,0} = n_{H_2O,0} = n_{CO_2,0} = 0 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{\\text{total},0} = n_{C_2H_6,0} + n_{O_2,0} + n_{C_2H_4,0} + n_{H_2O,0} + n_{CO_2,0} + n_{N_2,0} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second step in completing a reacton progress task is using these initial amounts and the given measures of reaction progress to calculate the apparent extents of reaction. In this problem there are two apparent extents of reaction, and the problem provides two measures of reaction progress, namely the O2 conversion and the selectivity for C2H4 over CO2. Thus, I can write the defining equations for these two measures of reaction progress.\n\n\n\n\\[\nf_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{O_2,0} - n_{O_2}}{n_{O_2,0}} = \\frac{n_{O_2,0} - \\left(n_{O_2,0} - \\xi_1 - 7 \\xi_2\\right)}{n_{O_2,0}} = \\frac{\\xi_1 + 7 \\xi_2}{n_{O_2,0}} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nS_{C_2H_4/CO_2} = \\frac{n_{C_2H_4}}{n_{CO_2}}  = \\frac{n_{C_2H_4,0} + 2 \\xi_1}{n_{CO_2,0} + 4 \\xi_2} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI can see that if I substitute the initial molar amount of O2 into equations (8) and (9) along with the expressions for the molar amounts of O2, C2H4, and CO2 from the mole table, I will have two equations with two unknowns, \\(\\xi_1\\) and \\(\\xi_2\\). So at this point I can calculate the apparent extents of reactions (1) and (2).\nAll that remains to complete this reaction progress task is to calculate the requested final mole fraction of CO2. To do that I simply need the defining equation for a mole fraction in a closed system, Equation 1.9.\n\n\n\n\\[\ny_{CO_2} = \\frac{n_{CO_2}}{n_{\\text{total}}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI can substitute the expressions for the molar amount of CO2 and the total molar amount from the mole table into equation (10). Then I can substitute the initial molar amounts and the apparent extents of reactions (1) and (2) and calculate the requested mole fraction of CO2.\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nSubstitute the given values and the basis into all other equations.\nCalculate \\(n_{C_2H_6,0}\\), \\(n_{O_2,0}\\), \\(n_{N_2,0}\\), \\(n_{C_2H_4,0}\\), \\(n_{H_2O,0}\\), \\(n_{CO_2,0}\\), and \\(n_{\\text{total},0}\\) using equations (3) through (7), and substitute the results into all other equations.\nSolve equations (8) and (9) for \\(\\xi_1\\) and \\(\\xi_2\\).\nCalculate the mole fraction of CO2 using equation (10).\n\nResult\nPerforming the calculations as described above shows that the final mole fraction of CO2 is 0.00321.\n\n\n3.4.2 Calculation of Outlet Composition from an Open System using the Conversion and Extent of Reaction\nSuppose reaction (1) was studied in an open, steady-state, isothermal, isobaric system. The flow into the system contained 0.5 mol min−1 of N2O5 and 0.5 mol min−1 of N2 at 600 K and 5 MPa. Generate an expression for the concentration of NO2 in terms of the molar flow rate of N2O5, the inlet molar flows, the temperature, and the pressure. If the outlet flow contains 30% N2, calculate the outlet concentration of NO2.\n\\[\n2 N_2O_5 \\leftrightarrows 4 NO_2 + O_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I call a reaction progress task; it is something that is typically done as one step in the completion of a reaction engineering assighment. As I noted in the preceding example, the completion of reaction engineering assignments often requires the calculation of the composition of a system given information about its initial composition together with some measure of how much reaction has taken place. In this case an expression for the composition is requested instead of a value.\nGenerally here are the steps for completing a reaction progress task: (1) use the given information about the initial composition to calculate the initial molar amounts (for closed systems) or inlet molar flow rates (for open, steady-state systems) of every reagent present in the system, (2) use the resulting initial amounts and the given measure of reaction progress to calculate the apparent extent of reaction, (3) use the apparent extents of reaction to calculate (or here, write expressions for) the final molar amounts or flow rates, and (4) use those results to calculate the requested quantity (or write an expression for it).\nI will start by summarizing the information profided in the problem statement. The problem only mentions N2O5 and N2 as flowing into the system, so I’ll assume the inlet flows of NO2 and O2 are zero.\n\n\n\nGiven: \\(T = 600 \\text{ K}\\), \\(P = 5 \\text{ MPa}\\), \\(y_{N_2,out} = 0.3\\).\nGiven Initial Composition: \\(\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} = 0.5 \\text{ mol min}^{-1}\\), \\(\\dot n_{N_2,in} = 0.5 \\text{ mol min}^{-1}\\), \\(\\dot n_{NO_2,in} = 0\\), \\(\\dot n_{O_2,in} = 0\\).\nRequested: an expression for \\(C_{NO_2}\\) and its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI could write a mole table, but with only one reaction taking place, I think I can get by without one. Expressions for the molar flow rates of N2O5, NO2, and O2 are straightforward, Equation 3.12. Looking at the reaction, I can see that each time the reaction occurs as written the total number of moles increases by 3, from 2 to 5, so \\(\\dot n_{\\text{total}} = \\dot n_{\\text{total},in} + 3 \\dot \\xi\\).\n\n\n\nNecessary Equations\n\\[\n\\dot n_{N_2O_5} = \\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} - 2 \\dot \\xi \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{NO_2} = \\dot n_{NO_2,in} + 4 \\dot \\xi \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{O_2} = \\dot n_{O_2,in} + \\dot \\xi \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{N_2} = \\dot n_{N_2,in} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{\\text{total}} = \\dot n_{\\text{total},in} + 3 \\dot \\xi \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem, two measures of the final composition are mentioned. The first is the concentration of NO2, and the other is the mole fraction of N2. I’ll write the defining equations for both, and for the concentration, I’ll also express the volumetric flow rate in terms of the molar amounts using the ideal gas equation. Then, I’ll substitute equations (2) through (6) for all of the molar flow rates.\n\n\n\n\\[\nC_{NO_2} = \\frac{\\dot n_{NO_2}}{\\dot V} = \\frac{P\\dot n_{NO_2}}{\\dot n_{total}RT} = \\frac{4P\\dot \\xi}{RT\\left( \\dot n_{\\text{total},in} + 3 \\dot \\xi \\right)} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_{N_2} = \\frac{\\dot n_{N_2}}{\\dot n_{total}} = \\frac{\\dot n_{N_2,in}}{\\dot n_{total,in} + 3 \\dot \\xi} \\tag{8}\n\\]\nExpression for \\(C_{NO_2}\\)\nThe problem asks for an expression for the concentration of NO2 in terms of the molar flow rate of N2O.

The result can be substituted into equation (7), yielding the requested expression for the concentration of NO2, equation (9).\n\\[\n\\dot \\xi = \\frac{\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} - \\dot n_{N_2O_5}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nC_{NO_2} &= \\frac{4P\\dot \\xi}{RT\\left( \\dot n_{\\text{total},in} + 3 \\dot \\xi \\right)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4P}{RT} \\frac{\\frac{\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} - \\dot n_{N_2O_5}}{2}}{\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} + \\dot n_{N_2,in} + 3\\frac{\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} - \\dot n_{N_2O_5}}{2}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{4P}{RT} \\frac{\\left(\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} - \\dot n_{N_2O_5}\\right)}{\\left(5\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} + 2\\dot n_{N_2,in} - 3 \\dot n_{N_2O_5} \\right)}\n\\end{align} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the value of the apparent extent of reaction, I need to use the given measure of reaction progress, which in this case is the final mole fraction of N2.\n\n\n\nCalculation of \\(C_{NO_2}\\)\n\nSubtitute the given and known quantities into all equations.\nSolve equation (8) to find the value of \\(\\dot \\xi\\).\nUse the resulting apparent extent of reaction to calculate \\(C_{NO_2}\\) using equation (7).\n\nResults\nThe requested expression for the concentration of NO2 is given in equation (9).

At system conditions, reactions (1) through (6) occur. Identify a complete, mathematically independent subset of those reactions and construct a mole table for the system.\n\\[\nCO + 2 H_2 \\leftrightarrows CH_3OH \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO + 3 H_2 \\leftrightarrows CH_4 + H_2O \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nCH_4 + H_2O \\leftrightarrows CH_3OH + H_2 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO + H_2O \\leftrightarrows CO_2 + H_2 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO_2 + 4 H_2 \\leftrightarrows CH_4 + 2 H_2O \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO_2 + 3 H_2 \\leftrightarrows CH_3OH + H_2O \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this problem asks me to do is something that is sometimes done as one step in the completion of a reaction engineering assigment. I often refer to this kind of task as an independent reactions task, since completing it involves identifying a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions that are taking place.\nI know from math courses I’ve taken that identifying mathematically independent equations involves constructing a matrix, and the same is true for identifying independent chemical reactions. Each column in the matrix corresponds to one of the reagants and each row corresponds to one of the reactions. The matrix element at any one row and column is the stoichiometric coefficent of the reagent corresponding to that column in the reaction corresponding to that row.\nHere the reaction matrix will have six rows, one for each reaction, and six columns, one for each reagent. I’ll let the first column corresponds to CO, the second to H2, the third to CH3OH, the fourth to CH4, the fifth to H2O, and the last to CO2. Letting the first row correspond to reaction (1), I see that the stoichiometric coefficient of CO in that reaction is -1, and so there is a -1 in the first column of row 1 (see equation (7) below). The stoichiometric coefficeint of H2 in the first reaction is -2, so there is a -2 in the second column of row 1. The stoichiometric coefficient of CH3OH in reaction (1) is +1, so there is a 1 in the third column of row 1. CH4, H2O, and CO2 do not appear in reaction (1), so there are zeros in the fourth, fifth and sixth columns of row 1. The remaining rows are filled in analogously.\nThe rank of this matrix will then equal the number of mathematically independent reactions. I’ll use computer software to find the rank.\n\n\n\nReaction Matrix\nEquation (7) shows a reaction matrix for this problem. The first row corresponds to reaction (1), the second row to reaction (2), and so on. The first column corresponds to CO, the second to H2, the third to CH3OH, the fourth to CH4, the fifth to H2O, and the last to CO2.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 1 & 0 & 1 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nMathematics software can be used to find that the rank of the matrix in equation (7) is equal to 3. This means that there will be 3 equations in any complete, mathematically independent subset of reactions (1) through (6).\nIn the matrix shown in equation (8) the first row corresponds to reaction (1) and the second row to reaction (2). The rank of this matrix is found to equal 2, so reactions (1) and (2) are mathematically independent.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{8}\n\\]\nIn the matrix shown in equation (9) a third row, corresponding to reaction (3), was added to the matrix in equation (8). The rank of the matrix in equation (9) is 2. This means that reaction (3) is not independent; it is a linear combinations of reactions (1) and (2).\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{9}\n\\]\nReaction (3) was removed from the matrix and replaced with reaction (4), resulting in the matrix shown in equation (10). The rank of the matrix shown in equation (10) is 3, so the reactions corresponding to the rows of that matrix, in this case reactions (1), (2), and (4), represent a complete, mathematically independent subset of reactions (1) through (6).\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving identified a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions, I can now construct a mole table as requested in the problem statement. There are six reagents in this system: CO, H2, CH3OH, CH4, H2O, and CO2. As in Example 3.4.1, the first column of the mole table lists these reagents along with a row at the bottom for “Total.” The second column lists variables representing the initial molar amounts of each reagent and the third column lists expressions for the molar amounts of the reagents at any later time in terms of the apparent extents of the independent reactions. I need to use Equation 3.11 for the entries in the third column of of the mole table\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\n\n\n\nFinal Answer\nWhile there are six reactions taking place in this system, only three reactions are mathematically independent. Therefore the mole table only uses the apparent extents of three reactions. Knowing that reactions (1), (2), and (4), represent a complete, mathematically independent subset of reactions (1) through (6), the apparent extents of those reactions were used to construct Table 3.2.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Mole Table for Example 3.4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nInitial Amount\nLater Amount\n\n\n\n\nCO\n\\(n_{CO,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CO,0} - \\xi_1 - \\xi_2 - \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nH2\n\\(n_{H_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{H_2,0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 3 \\xi_2 + \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nCH3OH\n\\(n_{CH_3OH,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CH_3OH,0} + \\xi_1\\)\n\n\nCH4\n\\(n_{CH_4,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CH_4,0} + \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nH2O\n\\(n_{H_2O,0}\\)\n\\(n_{H_2O,0} + \\xi_2 - \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nCO2\n\\(n_{CO_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CO_2,0} + \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0}\\)\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 2 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactions (1), (2), and (4) are not the only complete, mathematically independent subset. For example, reactions (1), (4), and (5) is also a complete, mathematically independent subset and the mole table could have been written using \\(\\xi_1\\), \\(\\xi_4\\), and \\(\\xi_5\\).\nThe solution presented here used a reaction matrix. Appendix B describes identifying independent reactions using the stoichiometric coefficient matrix where the columns correspond to the reactions and the rows to the reagents. The reaction matrix is the transpose of the stoichiometric coefficient matrix, and the rank of a matrix equals the rank of its transpose. For that reason, either the method used here or the method described in Appendix B can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Calculation of the Final Composition of a Closed System using the Conversion, Yield, Selectivity and Apparent Extents of Reaction\nA chemical system initially contains 34 mol CO and 66 mol H2. At system conditions, reactions (1) through (6) occur. At the end of the process, the CO conversion is 40%, the yield of CH3OH is 10.7% (mol CH3OH per initial mol CO), and the selectivity for methanol vs. methane is 0.38 mol CH3OH per mol CH4.

    "text": "4.1 Reaction Rates\nThe true extent of reaction \\(j\\), \\(\\Xi_j\\), was defined in Chapter 3 to be the net number of times molecular reaction event \\(j\\) has occurred, expressed in moles. Consider a volume, \\(V\\), where the temperature, pressure and composition are uniform and reaction \\(j\\) is taking place. The instantaneous net rate of reaction \\(j\\), \\(r_j\\), is then defined as shown in Equation 4.1. When this definition is used, the rate is said to be normalized per unit volume, and the rate is an intensive quantity.\n\\[\nr_j = \\frac{1}{V} \\frac{d\\Xi_j}{dt}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nRates can be normalized using quantities other than the volume. Generally, the best normalization factor is the size of the location where the reaction takes place. The systems considered so far in Reaction Engineering Basics, were a single phase fluid. For a single phase fluid, the reaction takes place everywhere in the fluid, so the volume is a good normalization factor. When two phases are present, it may be more complicated. For example, the reaction may only take place at the interface between the two phases, and in this case the interfacial area would be the best normalization factor.\nIn practice, normalization factors are sometimes chosen for convenience. As an example, the mass of a solid catalyst is often used to normalize heterogeneous catalytic reactions. A heterogeneous catalyst is a material that exists as a separate phase in contact with the fluid containing the reagents. It causes the rate of reaction to increase, but it is neither a reactant nor a product of the reaction. The reaction does not take place within the solid mass of the catalyst, but instead on its surface. Nonetheless, it is quite common to normalize heterogeneous catalytic reaction rates using the mass of the catalyst.\nIt is straightforward to renormalize a rate. All that is needed is the ratio of the factor used to normalize the rate to the desired normalization factor. In the example of a catalytic reaction normalized per catalyst mass, knowing the ratio of the mass of catalyst to the surface area of the catalyst, the rate per catalyst mass multiplied by that ratio would equal the rate per catalyst area. Example 4.5.1 illustrates the renormalization of a reaction rate.\nThe rate as defined in Equation 4.1 is based upon the reaction expression. The net rate of generation of reagent \\(i\\) due to the occurrence of reaction \\(j\\) is determined by the stoichiometry as shown in Equation 4.2. Recalling the sign convention for stoichiometric coefficients, if \\(i\\) is a reactant, its stoichiometric coefficient, and hence its rate of generation, will be negative. This make sense since a reactant is consumed by the reaction. A negative rate of generation is the same as a positive rate of consumption. If multiple reactions are taking place, the overall net rate of generation of \\(i\\) is the sum of its net rate of generation in each reaction. Example 4.5.1 illustrates conversion of a species generation rate to a general reaction rate.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} = \\nu_{i,j} r_j\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nEquation 4.1 and Equation 4.2 are expressions for the net rate of reaction \\(j\\) and the net rate of generation of \\(i\\) via reaction \\(j\\). It is also possible to define two absolute rates, one in the forward direction and the other in the reverse direction. That is, the change in the absolute number of times reactant molecules are converted to products due to the occurrence of molecular reaction event \\(j\\) defines the absolute rate of reaction \\(j\\) in the forward direction, \\(r_{j,f}\\). The change in the absolute number of times product molecules are converted to reactant molecules due to the occurrence of reaction \\(j\\) in the reverse direction similarly defines the absolute rate of reaction \\(j\\) in the reverse direction, \\(r_{j,r}\\). The net rate of reaction defined in Equation 4.1 is then simply the difference between the absolute rates as shown in Equation 4.3.\n\\[\nr_j = r_{j,f} - r_{j,r}\n\\tag{4.3}\\]",

    "text": "4.2 Instantaneous Yield and Selectivity\nChapter 3 introduced the overall yield and overall selectivity as measures of reaction progress. In that chapter it was noted that an instantaneous yield and an instantaneous selectivity can also be defined. Now, having defined species generation rates, that is possible. The instantaneous yield of product D from reactant \\(i\\) is simply the ratio of the rate of generation of D divided by the rate of consumption of \\(i\\), Equation 4.4. The negative sign in Equation 4.4 is needed to convert the rate of generation of \\(i\\) in the denominator to a rate of consumption. The rate of any reaction is expected to vary as the temperature, pressure and composition vary. That is the reason for referring to \\(Y_{D/i,inst}\\) as the instantaneous yield. It will change as the composition changes.\n\\[\nY_{D/i,inst} = - \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{D,j}}{\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{i,j}}\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\nIn an analogous manner, the instantaneous selectivity for the product, D, relative to the product, U, can be defined as shown in Equation 4.5. Selectivities can involve groups of products, e. g. selectivity for olefins relative to parafins. In that case, the numerator in Equation 4.5 would need an additional sum over all products, D, that were olefins and the denominator would need an additional sum over all products, U, that were parafins.\n\\[\nS_{D/U,inst} = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{D,j}}{\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{U,j}}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]",

    "text": "4.3 Cell Growth Rates\nMany important chemicals are produced biologically. As a living cell grows, it takes in nutrients and excretes wastes until it eventually divides into two cells. The waste produced during cell growth can be valuable chemicals such as penicillin. It is sometimes possible to treat the cell growth process as if it is a chemical reaction. When this is possible, the methods of chemical reaction engineering can be applied to design and operate the process.\nDifferent nomenclature is used to describe cell growth than is used to describe chemical reactions. The reactors are often referred to as chemostats or fermentors. The nutrients being fed to the system are often called substrates and not reactants.\nAnother difference between cell growth and chemical reactions is that there isn’t any stoichiometry associated with cell growth. In order to treat cell growth like a chemical reaction, it is necessary to use an average ratio of nutrient consumption to cell mass increase. This effective stoichiometry is typically expressed in terms of masses. Similarly, cell growth rates are typically defined in terms of cell mass as shown in Equation 4.6. \\[\nr_g = \\frac{1}{V}\\lim _{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac {\\Delta m_{cells}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{V} \\frac{dm_{cells}}{dt}\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\nThe specific cell growth rate, \\(\\mu\\), is a related growth rate.

    "title": "4  Reaction Rates and Rate Expressions",
    "section": "4.4 Rate Expressions",
    "text": "4.4 Rate Expressions\nReaction rates change as the temperature, pressure and composition of the system change. A rate expression is an equation for calculating the net rate of a reaction as a function of those variables. The form of an equilibrium expression is known from the stoichiometric coefficients in the reaction expression (Equation D.8). That is not necessarily true of the rate expression for a non-elementary reaction. The form of the rate expression for a non-elementary reaction is not known, a priori.\nAll rate expressions must satisfy two requirements. First, a rate expression must be single-valued. At a points in space with a given temperature, pressure and composition, the rate will always be the same. If the rate expression had two (non-imaginary) roots at those conditions, one would not know which was the correct rate. Hence rate expressions must be single-valued.\nThe second requirement relates to equilibrium. When a temperature, pressure and composition that correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium are substituted into a rate expression, it must evaluate to zero. While the absolute forward and absolute reverse rates are non-zero at equilibrium, the net rate is always equal to zero. For this reason, it is not uncommon for the equilibrium constant to be present in one of the terms in a rate expression.\n\n4.4.1 Validation of Rate Expressions\nExperimental kinetics data are needed in order to establish a rate expression for a given reaction. The generation of experimental kinetics data is discussed in Chapter 18. For present purposes, experimental kinetics data may be taken to consist of many data points. Each kinetics data point includes some measure of the composition (typically concentrations or partial pressures of all reagents), the temperature, the pressure, and the reaction rate at those conditions.\nThe approach to establishing a rate expression for a reaction begins by postulating the mathematical form of the rate expression. For elementary reactions, the mathematical form may be postulated on the basis of theory. For non-elementary reactions, one approach involves simply picking a mathematical form that is convenient to work with. Of course, the resulting rate expression still must accurately predict the reaction rate as a function of temperature, pressure and composition. It also must satisfy the two requirements of being single-valued and of evaluating to zero at equilibrium. When initially chosen, the mathematical form typically contains one or more unknown constants. These constants can be referred to as kinetics parameters and their values can be chosen to make the rate expression as accurate as possible while still satisfying the rate expression requirements.\nOnce a mathematical form has been postulated, the next step is called parameter estimation. The parameter estimation step is presented in Chapters 19, 20, and 21. It uses statistical methods to find the values of each unknown kinetics parameter that appears in the rate expression. The experimental kinetics data are used to find these values. The parameters are chosen so that the rate predicted by the rate expression for each experimental data point is as close as possible to the experimentally measured rate for that data point. Parameter estimation is sometimes referred to as fitting a rate expression to the experimental data.\nIn addition to the best values of the kinetics parameters, parameter estimation generates additional information. Some measure of the uncertainty in the values of the kinetics parameters is typically produced. Common examples are an estimate of the standard deviation or the 95% confidence interval for each parameter. Other statistical measures of how accurately the model represents the data (or how well the model “fits” the data) are also generated. Well-known examples include the correlation coefficient, \\(R\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). Example 4.5.4 illustrates parameter estimation using experimental data.\nThe next step in the process of establishing a rate expression for a reaction is assessing the accuracy of the rate expression. This assessment makes use of the statistical measures generated during parameter estimation. It may also include additional graphical methods. It should be noted that while parameter estimation yields the “best” values of the parameters, that does not mean that the underlying model is accurate. As an example, when \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) data are plotted, the plotted points might resemble a parabola. Parameter estimation can be used to find the best slope, \\(m\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), of a straight line model, \\(y = mx + b\\), for those data, but the resulting straight line still would not be accurate as seen in Figure 4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Straight line fit to a set of data that fall exactly on a parabola. While the “best” slope of the straight line is -2 and the “best” intercept is 8.6667, the line does not represent the data accurately.\n\n\n\nAccuracy assessment results in one of three decisions. If the rate expression is deemed to be sufficiently accurate for its intended purpose, the rate expression is accepted. Having been evaluated against experimental data, it can be said that the rate expression has been validated. This is always a judgement call, and as noted, it may be affected by the intended use of the rate expression. When a rate expression will be used to design a reactor for a multi-million dollar process, much higher accuracy may be required than if the rate expression is going to be used to size a small laboratory reactor.\nThe second possible decision is to generate additional data and then repeat the parameter estimation. This might happen if the accuracy is reasonable, but the uncertainty in the estimated value of one or more parameters is large. Experiments would be selected to try to reduce the uncertainty in those parameter values.\nThe third possible decision would be to reject the postulated mathematical form for the rate expression. A different mathematical form would then be postulated and the whole process would be repeated. Often, the inaccuracy observed with rejected model will suggest modifications to be used in the next postulated model. It is possible that a number of postulated models will be rejected before an acceptably accurate rate expression is found.\n\n\n4.4.2 Rate Coefficients\nEvery rate expression contains a quantity known as the rate coefficient. A lower case \\(k\\) is usually used to represent a rate coefficient. Additional subscripts may be added to indicate the reaction and other specifics about the rate coefficient. Rate coefficients depend upon temperature. By far the most common equation for modeling the temperature dependence of a rate coefficient is the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8.\n\\[\nk_j = k_{0,j} \\exp{\\left(  \\frac{-E_j}{RT} \\right)}\n\\tag{4.8}\\]\nWhen using Equation 4.8, the temperature must be expressed in absolute units, either K or °R. The constants, \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) are kinetics parameters known as the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy, respectively. It should be noted that the activation energy, \\(E_j\\), is a positive quantity.\nAs with other kinetics parameters, the values of \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) are determined during the parameter estimation stage of the validation of the rate expression. The most common way of doing this uses linear least squares. Taking the logarithm of each side of the Arrhenius expression yields Equation 4.9. Letting \\(y = \\ln{k_j}\\) and \\(x = \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right)\\), it can be seen that Equation 4.9 is a linear equation with a slope equal to \\(E_j\\) and an intercept equal to \\(\\ln{k_{0,j}}\\). As such, linear least squares can be used to estimate \\(E_j\\) and \\(k_{0,j}\\).\n\\[\n\\ln{k_j} = E_j \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right) + \\ln{k_{0,j}}\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\nIn addition to the estimated values of \\(E_j\\) and \\(k_{0,j}\\), linear least squares can be used to find the 95% confidence intervals for \\(E_j\\) and \\(k_{0,j}\\) and the coefficient of determinations, \\(R^2\\). Typical nomenclature for reporting an estimated parameter and its 95% confidence interval is provided in Appendix C. As an example, \\(E\\) = 20.0, 95% CI [19.2, 21.0] kJ mol-1 means that the best estimate for \\(E\\) is 20.0 kJ mol-1 with a 95% confidence interval between 19.2 and 21.0 kJ mol-1.\nOnce the values of the parameters have been estimated, a so-called model plot can be prepared. In a model plot, the experimental \\(x\\) vs. \\(y_\\text{expt}\\) data are plotted as points, and on the same axes, the model-predicted \\(x\\) vs. \\(y_\\text{pred}\\) data are plotted as a line. The following criteria will be satisfied if the Arrhenius expression accurately predicts the experimental results.\n\nIn the model plot, the experimental data points will scatter randomly about the line for the predicted results. The deviations from the line will be small and there will not be any systematic deviations about the line.\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), will be close to 1.0\nThe uncertainty in each parameter will be small relative to its value.\n\nThe estimation of Arrhenius parameters and assessment of the resulting expression are illustrated in Example 4.5.4.\n\n\n4.4.3 Empirical Rate Expressions\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics, the term empirical rate expression is used to refer to an experimentally validated rate expression in which the mathematical form was chosen for convenience. Power-law rate expressions are very common empirical rate expressions. In a power-law rate expression, the rate is proposed to depend upon the concentration or partial pressure (for gases) of each reagent in the system raised to an unknown power as shown in Equation 4.10 and Equation 4.11.\n\\[\nr_j = k_j \\prod_i C_i^{\\alpha_i}\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_j \\prod_i P_i^{\\alpha_i}\n\\tag{4.11}\\]\nIn power-law rate expressions, the exponents, \\(\\alpha_i\\), are unknown kinetics parameters. Their values are found during the parameter estimation stage of validating the rate expression. They do not necessarily equal the stoichiometric coefficient of \\(i\\) in reaction \\(j\\), nor are they necessarily integers or simple fractions. The rate may not depend on the amount of every species in the system. That is, for some reagents, \\(\\alpha_i\\) may be equal to zero. The sum of all of the exponents is known as the reaction order. The value of the exponent, \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the reaction order in \\(i\\).\nThe \\(k_j\\) in Equation 4.10 and Equation 4.11 represents the rate coefficient for reaction \\(j\\). Rate coefficients are not necessarily the only source of temperature dependence in rate expressions. It was noted earlier in this chapter that it is not uncommon for equilibrium constants to appear in rate expressions. Despite being called an equilibrium constant, they actually vary with temperature. If the standard entropy and standard enthalpy of reaction \\(j\\) are assumed to be constant, the equilibrium constant varies with temperature as shown in Equation 4.12. Equation 4.12 is similar to the Arrhenius expression for the temperature dependence of rate coefficients. One difference is that the heat of reaction, \\(\\Delta H_j^0\\) can be either positive or negative, but the activation energy, \\(E_j\\), is always positive.\n\\[\nK_j = \\exp{\\frac{\\Delta S_j^0}{R}} \\exp{\\frac{-\\Delta H_j^0}{RT}} = K_{0,j}\\exp{\\frac{-\\Delta H_j^0}{RT}}\n\\tag{4.12}\\]\nThe net rate of a reversible reaction will go to zero while reactants are still remaining. It is important to check that postulated rate expressions evaluate to zero at equilibrium. A power-law rate expression will not do so. Any postulated rate expression can be modified so that it does properly evaluate to zero at equilibrium by simply multiplying it by the factor shown in Equation 4.13. That equation assumes that \\(K_{j,c}\\) is a concentration-based equilibrium constant. An equivalent equation using partial pressures and a partial pressure-based equilibrium constant can be used with ideal gases, Equation 4.14. Notice that within this factor, the exponent for each species’ concentration is its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction \\(j\\). That is, there are no kinetics parameters in these factors. Example 4.5.2 illustrates the use of Equation 4.14 to force a rate expression to evaluate to zero at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\\[\n\\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{\\displaystyle \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu _i,j}}{K_{j,c}} \\right\\}\n\\tag{4.13}\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{\\displaystyle \\prod_i P_i^{\\nu _i,j}}{K_{j,p}} \\right\\}\n\\tag{4.14}\\]\nPower-law rate expressions can sometimes be used for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Often, however, they do not describe the variation of the rate with sufficient accuracy. An old paper by Yang and Hougen (1950) provides a set of tables that can be used to generate many mathematical functions that can be tested as rate expressions for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.\nAs previously noted, it is sometimes possible to model processes involving the growth of living cells as if they involved chemical reactions. Rate expressions are needed in order to do so. One common expression for the specific cell growth rate is the Monod equation, Equation 4.15. In that expression \\(\\mu_{max}\\) and \\(K_s\\) are kinetics parameters whose values are determined using parameter estimation methods. The substrate concentration, \\(C_S\\), in Equation 4.15 is a mass concentration and not a molar concentration. Example 4.5.3 considers limiting cases of the Monod equation for cell growth.\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{K_s + C_S}\n\\tag{4.15}\\]\n\n\n4.4.4 Theoretical Rate Expressions\nIt was noted above that the mathematical form for a non-elementary reaction is not known a priori. The reason for this is that at the molecular level, the non-elementary reaction doesn’t occur as a single event. All breaking and forming of bonds does not occur simultaneously, and as a consequence, intermediate species are created. In other words, a non-elementary reaction is actually a group of reactions that is treated as if it were a single reaction. As such, it does not lend itself to a general theoretical treatment. In contrast, an elementary reaction is a single molecular event where all breaking and forming of bonds is simultaneous.\nBeing a single molecular event, elementary reactions can be considered from a theoretical perspective. The theory can then be used to predict the mathematical form of rate expressions for elementary reactions. Two such theories are described in Appendices F and G. Collision theory is based upon the kinetic theory of gases. It assumes that molecular velocities obey a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and that when molecules with sufficient kinetic energy collide, they react. (See Appendix F for a more complete description of the theory and a derivation of the associated reaction rate expression.) Transition state theory assumes that the reactants in a system are in a kind of thermodynamic equilibrium with activated complexes that are forming products. It uses statistical thermodynamics to determine the number of such complexes and the frequency at which they decompose. The absolute rate in the forward direction is then equal to the product of those two quantities. (See Appendix G for a more complete description of the theory and a derivation of the associated reaction rate expression.)\nAccording to either theory, the net rate of elementary reaction \\(j\\) can be written as shown in Equation 4.16, but they predict different dependence of the pre-exponential factor, \\(k_{0,j}\\) upon temperature. (Recall that the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, predicts that the pre-exponential factor is constant.) Generally, the variation of \\(k_{0,j}\\) with temperature is very small compared to the variation of the exponential term, \\(\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j}}{RT}\\right)}\\). As a result, an accurate rate expression usually results if \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) are taken to be constant kinetics parameters.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)} \\left(\\prod_i C_i^{-\\nu_{i,j}}\\right) \\\\\n&- \\frac{k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{j,eq_c}} \\left(\\prod_{i^\\prime} C_{i^\\prime}^{\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4.16}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) indexes all reactants in reaction \\(j\\) and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes all products in reaction \\(j\\).\nFor an ideal gas system, the concentration of reagent \\(i\\) is equal to its partial pressure divided by \\(RT\\). Making that substiution for each concentration in Equation 4.16 yields a rate expression in terms of partial pressures. The variation of the \\(RT\\) terms that this introduces is again small compared to the \\(\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j}}{RT}\\right)}\\) term. As a result, the \\(RT\\) terms can be incorporated into the pre-exponential factor and the pre-exponential factor again can be taken to be a constant kinetics parameter. This results in Equation 4.17.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)} \\left(\\prod_i P_i^{-\\nu_{i,j}}\\right) \\\\\n&- \\frac{k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{j,eq_p}} \\left(\\prod_{i^\\prime} P_{i^\\prime}^{\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4.17}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) indexes all reactants in reaction \\(j\\) and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes all products in reaction \\(j\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall from Chapter 1 that a reaction like Equation 4.18 is called a unimolecular reaction. Unimolecular reactions are not elementary reactions (Lindemann et al. (1922)). Nonetheless, the rate expression resulting from application of Equation 4.16 or Equation 4.17 is generally found to be valid unless the pressure is very low. In Reaction Engineering Basics, rate expressions for unimolecular reactions will be assumed to have the mathematical form predicted by Equation 4.16 or Equation 4.17. As such, the mathematical form of the rate expression for Equation 4.18 is as shown in Equation 4.19 or Equation 4.20.\n\\[\nA_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 A\n\\tag{4.18}\\]\n\\[\nr = k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}C_{A_2} -  \\frac{k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{eq_c}} C_A^2\n\\tag{4.19}\\]\n\\[\nr = k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}P_{A_2} -  \\frac{k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{eq_p}} P_A^2\n\\tag{4.20}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to discern whether a reaction is elementary by simply looking at the reaction expression. Unless one knows from other information that a reaction is elementary, the rate expressions in Equation 4.16 and Equation 4.17 should be treated as postulated rate expressions. The values of \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) should be determined by statistical parameter estimation using experimental kinetics data, after which the accuracy of the resulting rate expression should be assessed.\nImportantly, the equilibrium constant in Equation 4.16 and Equation 4.17 is not a kinetics parameter and its value should not be determined by parameter estimation methods. The one exception to this, discussed in Chapter 5, would be if the equilibrium constant for reaction \\(j\\) and its temperature dependence (or equivalently, the heat, free energy and entropy of reaction \\(j\\)) are not available and can not easily be measured. In that case, the equilibrium constant can be written as in Equation 4.12 with \\(K_{0,j}\\) and \\(\\Delta H_j^0\\) treated as kinetics parameters.\n\n\n4.4.5 Mechanistic Rate Expressions\nThere is another way to postulate the mathematical form of the rate expression for an non-elementary reaction. It stems from knowing that a non-elementary reaction actually represents a group of molecular level reactions. It involves guessing the specific molecular level reactions that are involved, and then combining the rate expressions for those molecular level reactions. This approach for postulating the rate expression for a non-elementary reaction is the topic of Chapter 5.",

(One reason for this is that ammonia is used to make fertilizer.) It is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. The ammonia synthesis catalyst takes the form of pellets that pack into the the reactor with an apparent density of 155 lbm ft-3. Rase (1977) provides the expression in equation (2) for the rate of generation of ammonia via reaction (1). In that expression, \\(E_1\\) is the activation energy, \\(K_{1,eq}\\) is the equilibrium constant and \\(a_i\\) represents the thermodynamic activity of reagent \\(i\\).\n\\[\n3 H_2 + N_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 NH_3 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_{NH_3,1} &= 1.54 \\times 10^{15} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\\\\n&\\times \\left[ K_{1,eq}^2\\left( \\frac{a_{N_2}a_{H_2}^{1.5}}{a_{NH_3}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{a_{NH_3}}{a_{H_2}^{1.5}} \\right)  \\right] \\frac{\\text{kmol NH}_3}{\\text{m}_{\\text{bed}}^3 \\text{h}}\n\\end{align} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nWrite an expression for the general rate of reaction (1), \\(r_1\\), that is normalized per lbm of catalyst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that the units of a reaction rate are always moles per time per normalization factor. For a rate expression, that means that if you multiply the units of the pre-exponential factor by the units of the composition variables in the rate expression, you should end up with units of moles per time per normalization factor. Looking at equation (2) I see that the pre-exponential factor has units of moles (actually kmol NH3) per time per volume of the bed (in cubic meters). The equilibrium constant and the thermodynamic activities do not have units, so the rate also has units of moles per time per volume of the bed.\nSo, from the units on the pre-exponential factor in equation (2), I can see that the rate normalization factor is the volume of the catalyst bed. The problem asks for a rate normalized per mass of catalyst, so solving this problem will involve renormalizaton of the rate. To do that, I need to know the ratio of the old normalization factor to the new normalization factor. Here that ratio is given in the problem statement. It is the reciprocal of the apparent density, so dividing equation (2) by the apparent density will renormalize the rate.\nI can also see, both from the units and from the variable used to represent the rate in equation (2), that the rate expression yields a species generation rate, specifically the rate of generation of ammonia. The problem asks for an expression for the general reaction rate (not the rate of species generation), so the solution will also involve converting from a species generation rate to a reacton rate.\n\n\n\nGiven\n\\(\\rho _{bed}\\) = 155 lbm ft-3.\nNecessary Equations\nEquation 4.2 can be used to convert the species generation rate to the general reaction rate. Applying that equation to the present problem yields equation (3).\n\\[\nr_{i,j} = \\nu_{i,j} r_j \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_j = \\frac{r_{i,j}}{\\nu_{i,j}}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = \\frac{r_{NH_3,1}}{\\nu _{NH_3,1}} = \\frac{r_{NH_3,1}}{2} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nThe rate expression in equation (2) is normalized using the volume of the catalyst bed. Upon substitution in equation (3), the resulting reaction rate also will be normalized by the volume of the catalyst bed. The apparent bed density is the mass of catalyst divided by the volume of the bed, so the rate per bed volume can be converted to the rate per catalyst mass simply by dividing by the apparent bed density, equation (4), where \\(r_1^\\prime\\) is the renormalized rate expression.\n\\[\nr_1^\\prime = r_1 \\frac{V_{cat}}{m_{cat}} = \\frac{r_1}{\\rho _{bed}} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nCalculations\n\nSubstitute equation (2) in equation (3).\nSubstitute the result from step 1 and the given bed density into equation (4).\n\nResult\nPerforming the calculations as described yields the rate expression shown in equation (5). Notice that the value of \\(k_0\\) changed from \\(1.54 \\times 10^{15}\\) to \\(1.76 \\times 10^{14}\\) and the units changed from \\(\\frac{\\text{kmol NH}_3}{\\text{m}_{\\text{bed}}^3 \\text{h}}\\) to \\(\\frac{\\text{kmol}}{\\text{lb}_{\\text{m}} \\text{h}}\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_1 &= 1.76 \\times 10^{14} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\\\\n&\\times \\left[ K_{1,eq}^2\\left( \\frac{a_{N_2}a_{H_2}^{1.5}}{a_{NH_3}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{a_{NH_3}}{a_{H_2}^{1.5}} \\right)  \\right] \\frac{\\text{kmol}}{\\text{lb}_{\\text{m}} \\text{h}}\n\\end{align} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n4.5.2 Forcing a Power-law Rate Expression to Exhibit Proper Behavior at Equilibrium\nThe water-gas shift, reaction (1), is used commercially to remove CO impurities from hydrogen. Suppose the rate expression shown in equation (2) was validated using experimental data that were far from thermodynamic equilibrium. At 675 K, the rate coefficient, \\(k_1\\), was found to equal to 3.37 lbmol h-1 ft-3 atm-0.55. In equation (3), that power-law rate expression has been multiplied by a factor that will force it to evaluate to zero at equilibrium. At 675 K, the equilibrium constant, \\(K_1\\) is equal to 12.0.\nIf a system initially containing 75% H2O, 24% CO, and 1% CO2 at 10 atm and 675 K reacts isothermally and isobarically, the equilibrium conversion of CO will equal 96%. The net rate should go to zero at this conversion.\n\\[\nCO + H_2O \\rightleftarrows CO_2 + H_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 P_{CO}^{0.9} P_{H_2O}^{0.25} P_{CO_2}^{-0.6} \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 P_{CO}^{0.9} P_{H_2O}^{0.25} P_{CO_2}^{-0.6} \\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{P_{CO_2} P_{H_2}}{K_1 P_{CO} P_{H_2O}} \\right\\} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nFor the system described above, make a plot of the net rate of reaction (1) predicted by equations (2) and (3) at CO conversions between 0 and 100%. Then make a second plot at conversions between 85 and 100%. Comment upon the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI am asked to plot the rates predicted by equations (2) and (3) as a function of the CO conversion, given an initial composition, temperature, and pressure. Looking at the equations, I can see that I will need the partial pressures of the reagents to calculate the rate. I know the initial composition and I can choose the conversions to be plotted, so the first part of this problem is basically a reaction progress problem, similar to those presented in Chapter 3.\nNone of the quantities that are given are extensive, so I may choose a basis. The temperature and pressure are given, so if I choose a volume as the basis for my calculations, I can use the ideal gas law to calculate the initial molar amounts.\n\n\n\nGiven\n\\(k_1\\) = 3.37 lbmol h-1 ft-3 atm-0.55, \\(K_1\\) = 12.0, \\(y_{H_2O,0}\\) = 0.75, \\(y_{CO,0}\\) = 0.24, \\(y_{CO_2,0}\\) = 0.01, \\(P\\) = 10 atm, \\(T\\) = 675 K, \\(f_{CO,eq}\\) = 0.96.\nBasis\n\\(V\\) = 1 L.\nNecessary Equations\nThe initial percentages of CO, H2O, and CO2 sum to 100%, so the initial mole fraction of H2 must equal zero. Using the chosen basis, the initial molar amounts of the reagents can be calculated using the ideal gas law as shown in equations (4) through (7).\n\\[\nn_{CO,0} = \\frac{y_{CO,0} PV}{RT} \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{H_2O,0} = \\frac{y_{H_2O,0} PV}{RT} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{CO_2,0} = \\frac{y_{CO_2,0} PV}{RT} \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{H_2,0} = \\frac{\\cancelto{0}{y_{H_2,0}} PV}{RT} = 0 \\tag{7}\n\\]\nKnowing the initial moles of CO, the final moles of CO at any conversion can be calculated using the definition of conversion, equation (8).\n\\[\nn_{CO} = n_{CO,0}\\left(1 - f_{CO}\\right) \\tag{8}\n\\]\nThat result, together with the previously determined initial moles of CO allows the calculation of the extent of reaction, equation (9)\n\\[\nn_{CO} = n_{CO,0} - \\xi_1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\xi_1 = n_{CO,0} - n_{CO} \\tag{9}\n\\]\nThe final molar amounts of the other reagents can next be computed using their initial amounts and the extent of reaction, equations (10) through (12).\n\\[\nn_{H_2O} = n_{H_2O,0} - \\xi_1 \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{CO_2} = n_{CO_2,0} - \\xi_1 \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{H_2} = \\cancelto{0}{n_{H_2,0}} + \\xi_1 \\tag{12}\n\\]\nThe ideal gas law can then be used to calculate the final partial pressures of the reagents as shown in equations (13) through (16).\n\\[\nP_{CO} = \\frac{n_{CO}RT}{V} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{H_2O} = \\frac{n_{H_2O}RT}{V} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{CO_2} = \\frac{n_{CO_2}RT}{V} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{H_2} = \\frac{n_{H_2}RT}{V} \\tag{16}\n\\]\nAt this point the rates predicted by equations (2) and (3) can be calculated.\nCalculations\n\nSubstitute the given values and the chosen basis into all equations.\nCalculate the initial moles of CO, H2O, CO2, and H2 using equations (4) through (7).\nChoose a CO conversion between 0 and 100%.\n\nCalculate the final moles of CO at that conversion using equation (8).\nCalculate the apparent extent of reaction using equation (9).\nCalculate the final moles of H2O, CO2, and H2 using equations (10) through (12).\nCalculate the final partial pressures of CO, H2O, CO2, and H2 using equations (13) through (16).\nCalculate the rate predicted by equation (2).\nCalculate the rate predicted by equation (3).\n\nRepeat step 3 to generate a set of conversions that span the range from 0 to 100% and the corresponding rates predicted by equations (2) and (3).\nPlot the full set of results.\nPlot the results for conversions between 85% and 100%.\n\nResults and Comments\nFigure 4.2 shows the rate of reaction (1) predicted by equations (2) and (3) at conversions between 0 and 100%, based upon isothermal, isobaric reaction with an initial mixture of 75% H2O, 24% CO, and 1% CO2 at 10 atm and 675 K. Figure 4.3 shows the same data, but only for conversions between 85 and 100%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Rate of water-gas shift as a function of CO conversion as predicted by power-law rate expressions with and without a factor that forces them to evaluate to zero at equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Rate of water-gas shift at conversions near equilibrium as predicted by power-law rate expressions with and without a factor that forces them to evaluate to zero at equilibrium.\n\n\n\nThe figures allow two important observations. First, Figure 4.2 shows that adding the term to force proper behavior at equilibrium does not affect the predicted rate at conditions far from equilibrium. Hence, since rate expression (2) was validated and found to be accurate at conditions far from equilibrium, the figure shows that rate expression (3) will be equally accurate at those conditions.\nSecond, Figure 4.3 shows that when the reaction reaches equilbrium at 96% conversion, rate expression (2) predicts that the rate will equal 0.37 lbmol h-1 ft-3 while rate expression (3) predicts the rate will be zero. The consequences of using rate expression (2), for example to design a reactor where the conversion approaches equilibrium, could be severe. The design calculations would indicate that, for example, 98% conversion could be achieved in the reactor, but of course, if the reactor was built, the conversion would never exceed 96%. If rate expression (3) was used to design a reactor, the calculations would indicate that the largest possible conversion is 96%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Figure 4.3 shows conversions greater than equilibrium, it should be noted that one could not reach the conversions above 96% by reacting the starting mixture at constant \\(T\\) and \\(P\\). However, one could make a mixture of the reagents that has the same composition as if the initial mixture had reached a higher conversion. Figure 4.3 shows that if one did this, the reaction of that mixture would be predicted to have a negative rate. That is, the reaction would proceed in the reverse direction, and when it reached a composition equivalent to 96% conversion of the initial mixture in the problem statement, the rate would again go to zero because the system would be at equilibrium.\nAlso, Figure 4.3 only shows conversions up to 99% for rate expression (3). The reason for this is that rate expression (3) preducts a rate of negative infinity at 100% conversion. At 100% conversion, the partial pressure of CO would equal zero, and since \\(P_{CO}\\) appears in the denominator in the equilbrium factor, the factor becomes equal to negative infinity. The important point is that if one has a rate expression for the forward rate of a reversible reaction that includes a factor to force proper equilibrium behavior, that rate expression should not be used to predict the rate of the reverse reaction. Instead, a reverse rate expression should be postulated and experimentally validated.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Limiting Cell Growth Rates Predicted by the Monod Equation\nThe growth rate of a certain microbial cell line is accurately represented by the Monod equation with \\(\\mu _{max}\\) equal to 1 h-1 and \\(K_s\\) equal to 0.2 g L-1. Plot the specific growth rate vs. the mass concentration of substrate over a sufficiently wide range of concentrations to show all limiting behavior. Describe the asymptotic behavior mathematically and in terms of what is happening physically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem statement pretty much tells me what to do. The only thing I don’t know is how large \\(C_S\\) will need to be in order to see the limiting behavior. I know that zero is the smallest value. I will simply pick a largest value and make the plot. If the plot doesn’t show the limiting behavior, I’ll change the largest value and repeat until the plot is acceptable.\n\n\n\nGiven\n\\(\\mu_{max}\\) = 1 h-1, \\(K_s\\) = 0.2 g L-1.\nNecessary Equations\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{K_s + C_S} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nCalculations\n\nChoose values of \\(C_S\\) and use equation (1) to calculate the corresponding value of \\(\\mu\\).\nPlot the results.\n\nIf the figure does not show limiting behavior, change the maximum value of \\(C_S\\) and repeat from step 1.\n\n\nResult\nFigure 4.4 shows the specific cell growth rate predicted by the Monod equation. At very low substrate concentration, the curve is nearly linear. Looking at equation (1) it can be seen that when the substrate concentration is neglibibly small compared to \\(K_s\\), the Monod equation reduces to equation (2). Equation (2) is a linear equation with the slope equal to \\(\\frac{\\mu_{max}}{K_s}\\). Physically this corresponds to a situation where the amount of available nutrient (substrate) is so small that the cells can’t all get enough to grow. Put differently, in this situation the cells are forced to compete with each other for nutrient. When one of the competing cells takes in nutrient, it grows, but the others can’t.\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{K_s + \\cancelto{0}{C_S}} = \\frac{\\mu_{max}}{K_s}C_S \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Specific cell growth rate predicted by the Monod equation with \\(\\mu_{max}\\) = 1 h-1 and \\(K_s\\) = 0.2 g L-1.\n\n\n\nAs the substrate concentration becomes very large, Figure 4.4 suggests that the specific growth rate will become constant. This can be seen by examination of equation (1). When \\(K_s\\) becomes negligibly small compared to \\(C_S\\), the Monod equation reduces to equation (3) where the specific growth rate is constant and equal to \\(\\mu_{max}\\). Physically, this limit is the opposite of the first. Here the nutrient is abundant and each cell can take in as much as it needs. Every cell is taking in nutrient and growing as fast as it can, so increasing the amount of nutrient has no effect.\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{\\cancelto{0}{K_s} + C_S} = \\mu_{max} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n\n4.5.4 Estimating the Pre-exponential Factor and Activation Energy in the Arrhenius Expression.\nKinetic studies were performed at a number of different temperatures, \\(T\\), to find the value of a second order rate coefficient, \\(k\\), at those temperatures. The results for each experiment, \\(i\\), are given in the table below. Determine whether the temperature dependence of this rate coefficient is consistent with the Arrhenius equation, and find the best values for the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Rate coefficients measured experimentally at different temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ni (Expt.

In other words, does the Arrhenius expression accurately predict the value of the rate coefficient, \\(k\\), at each of the tempertures, \\(T\\), listed in Table 4.1. To answer this question, I can see that I’ll need to fit the Arrhenius expression to the experimental data and then assess the accuracy of the model.\nFrom the information provided in this chapter, I now that the most common way to fit the Arrhenius expression to experimental data is by using the linearized form shown in Equation 4.9. To do that, I’ll first need to convert the temperatures to absolute units. Then I can calculate the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experimental data point.\nIn general, when solving problems I like to start by listing the quantities whose values are given in the problem statement, assigning them to approprite variable symbols. In this problem I’m given several values of \\(T\\) and \\(k\\); I’ll underline these in my listing to indicate that they are vector quantities. I also like to list any relationships I’m provided. Here I’m told to use the Arrhenius expression, and since I now I’ll use the linearized form, I’ll list that.\n\n\n\nGiven and Known: \\(\\underline{T}\\) and \\(\\underline{k}\\).\nModel:\n\\[\n\\ln{k} = E \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right) + \\ln{k_0} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nDefining \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) as shown in equations (2) and (3) shows that equation (1) has the linear form shown in equation (4) when the slope, \\(m\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), are defined as in equations (5) and (6).\n\\[\ny = \\ln{k} \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right) \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = m x + b \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nm = E \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nb = \\ln{k_0} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nAfter converting the temperatures to K, \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) can be computed for each experiment using equations (2) and (3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I need to fit equation (4) to the data. This can be done using a spreadsheet program. The original data would first be entered in two columns, then new columns would be added for \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Those columns would the be plotted as a \\(x-y\\) scatterplot. Adding a linear trendline will fit equation (4) to the data, and in most spreadsheets the equation can be displayed on the graph along with the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). I would also like the undertainty in the values of the slope, \\(E\\), and intercept, \\(\\ln{k_0}\\). The way those are calculated will depend upon the specific spreadsheet program being used.\nAn alternative approach is to simply use linear least squares software to do the fitting and then plotting the results.\n\n\n\nUsing linear least squares software, the following Arrhenius parameter values were estimated: \\(k_0\\) = 6.97 x 106 L mol-1 min-1, 95% CI [1.01 x 106, 4.79 x 107] and \\(E\\) = 57.3 kJ mol-1, 95% CI [52, 62.5]. The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), was found to equal 0.992. The results were used to generate the model plot shown in Figure 4.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Arrhenius plot comparing the model (line) to the experimental data (points).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing I need to do is to assess the accuracy of the resulting Arrhenius expression. The criteria for assessing the accuracy were presented earlier in this chapter.\n\n\n\nThe uncertainty in \\(k_0\\), that is the difference between the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval, is 4.69 x 107 L mol-1 min-1. This is quite large compared to the estimated value of \\(k_0\\), 6.97 x 106 L mol-1 min-1. Estimated pre-exponential factors are often found to have large uncertainties. The uncertainty in the activation energy is 10.5 kJ mol-1 (18%) compared to the estimated value of 57.3 kJ mol-1. The coefficient of determination is quite close to 1.0, however, and the model plot shows good agreement between the experimental data and the model with no trends in the deviations. Overall, it appears that the experimental data are consistent with the Arrhenius expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example illustrated the preferred way to report a value together with its 95% confidence interval: “value units, 95% CI [lower bound, upper bound],” Thus \\(E\\) = 57.3 kJ mol-1, 95% CI [52, 62.5] means that the estimated value of \\(E\\) is 57.3 kJ mol-1, and if the experiments were repeated many times, 95% of those times the estimated value of \\(E\\) would be between 52 kJ mol-1 and 62.5 kJ mol-1.",

    "text": "5.1 Reaction Mechanisms\nUnderstanding the mechanism of a non-elementary reaction can be useful in a number of ways. Often reaction mechanisms are studied with the intention of using that knowledge to modify the reactive process. Because the intermediate species in a reaction mechanism are not readily observable using typical analysis instruments, the experimental study of mechanisms is demanding. Reaction Engineering Basics does not touch upon the experimental study of reaction mechanisms. Its focus with respect to mechanisms is on generating apparent rate expressions for non-elementary reactions given either a proposed mechanism or a mechanism that is well-established by experimental study.\nThe species that participate in a reaction mechanism but do not appear in the reaction expression for the non-elementary reaction are called reactive intermediates. The concentrations of reactive intermediates are always very small. Otherwise they would be observed at the macroscopic level. The reason reactive intermediates have small concentrations is that they react quickly making their lifetimes very short. That’s why they are called reactive intermediates. The identification of reactive intermediates when solving problems involving mechanisms is illustrated in every example at the end of this chapter.\nBy definition, every reaction in a reaction mechanism is an elementary reaction. Consequently, the rate expression for each mechanistic step will have the functional form shown in Equation 4.16, or for gases, in Equation 4.17. Those equations include the equilibrium constant for the elementary step. Very often in the case of mechanistic steps, thermodynamic data are not available for the reactive intermediates. In those cases, the equilibrium constant for the mechanistic step won’t be known. For this reason, in this chapter the rate expressions for elementary mechanistic steps will be written as shown in Equation 5.1, and the reverse rate coefficients treated as kinetics parameters. The square brackets in that equation can represent concentrations or (if the reagents are gases) partial pressures. When writing the rate expressions in this way, it is important to remember that the forward and reverse rate coefficients must be consistent with thermodynamics. The use of Equation 5.1 when solving problems involving mechanisms also is illustrated in every example at the end of this chapter.\n\\[\nr_j = k_{j,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}} - k_{j,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{\\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},j}}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\nThere are a few rules that all mechanisms must obey. There must be some linear combination of the mechanistic steps that exactly equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Being elementary reactions, every step in a reaction mechanism must be reversible. This is required by the principle of microscopic reversibility. In addition, the mechanistic steps must be consistent with all available experimental data including (isotopic effects, isotope distributions in products, spectroscopic measurements, etc.) and not just the reaction kinetics.\nReaction mechanisms are sometimes differentiated as having either an open sequence of steps or a closed sequence. Mechanisms with a closed sequence of steps are commonly referred to as chain reaction mechanisms. The distinguishing feature of a chain reaction mechanism is that it includes elementary steps known as propagation steps. A propagation step is a step wherein one reactive intermediate participates as a reactant and another reactive intermediate is formed as a product. The full set of propagation steps in the mechanism forms a closed sequence where each reactive intermediate is produced in one propagation step and consumed in a different propagation step. In a chain reaction mechanism, the apparent, non-elementary reaction is, in fact, a linear combination of the full set of propagation steps. As a consequence, propagation steps occur many, many more times than the other steps in the mechanism.\nHBr synthesis, Equation 5.2, is a non-elementary reaction. The HBr synthesis mechanism, Equations 5.3 through 5.6, is a classic example of a chain reaction mechanism. Notice that reactions 5.4 and 5.5 each consume one reactive intermediate and generate a different reactive intermediate. This makes reactions 5.4 and 5.5 propagation steps. More specifically, reaction 5.4 consumes a Br· reactive intermediate and generates an H· reactive intermediate. Then reaction 5.5 consumes an H· reactive intermediate and generates a Br· reactive intermediate. Adding just these two propagation steps together yields the apparent, non-elementary reaction 5.2.\n\\[\nH_2 + Br_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 HBr\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\n\\[\nBr_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 Br \\cdot\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\n\\[\nBr \\cdot + H_2 \\rightleftarrows HBr + H \\cdot\n\\tag{5.4}\\]\n\\[\nH \\cdot + Br_2 \\rightleftarrows HBr + Br \\cdot\n\\tag{5.5}\\]\n\\[\n2 H \\cdot \\rightleftarrows H_2\n\\tag{5.6}\\]\nWhile the sum of the two propagation steps, 5.4 and 5.5, equals the apparent non-elementary reaction, the other steps are still needed. This can be seen by noting that if neither reaction 5.3 nor reaction 5.6 ever occurred, then there would not be any reactive intermediates present, and that would mean that the propagation steps could not occur. In theory, either reaction 5.3, in the forward direction, or reaction 5.6, in the reverse direction, would need to occur at least one time in order to get the propagation sequence going. Steps 5.4 and 5.5 could then occur over and over until all of the Br2 or all of the H2 was used up. At that point, reaction 5.3, in the reverse direction, or reaction 5.6, in the forward direction, would need to occur one time to use up the reactive intermediates.\nReactions 5.3 and 5.6 are examples of two additional kinds of steps found in chain reaction mechanisms. These kinds of steps are known as initiation steps and termination steps. An elementary initiation step does not have a reactive intermediate as a reactant, but it generates one or more reactive intermediates as products. Similarly, termination steps consume reactive intermediates without producing any new ones. As noted above, even though initiation and termination steps only need to occur a small number of times compared to the propagation steps they are still a necessary kind of elementary reaction step for a chain reaction mechanism.\nIt has already been noted that every elementary reaction must be reversible. As such, the definitions just given for initiation and termination steps don’t make much sense because the reverse of any initiation step will be a termination step by definition, and similarly, the reverse of any termination step will be an initiation step. It is perhaps better to refer to them as initiation/termination steps. Usually, when one says that a step is an initiation step, what is meant is that the step in the forward direction, as written, is an initiation step. Commonly, the mechanistic steps corresponding to an apparent, non-elementary reaction will be written so that the reactants in the initiation step are also reactants in the apparent, non-elementary reaction.\nChain transfer steps can also appear in chain reaction mechanisms. These steps are common in free radical polymerization mechanisms. In free radical polymerization, a very long hydrocarbon molecule (the so-called chain) has a free radical at one end. Monomer molecules react with the free radical end of the growing polymer chain, with the net result that the chain is longer by one monomer unit and still has a free radical at the end. In a chain transfer step, a monomer adds to the end of a growing polymer chain, but the free radical transfers to a different molecule. That is, a chain transfer step terminates one growing chain and starts a new one.\nYet another type of step in chain reactions is known as a chain branching step. Chain branching steps must be kept under control; if they are not controlled, they can lead to explosions. In an elementary chain branching step, one reactive intermediate is consumed, but two new reactive intermediates are generated. Clearly if these steps get out of control, the number of reactive intermediates will increase geometrically. This, coupled with the fact that reactive intermediates are so highly reactive, is why explosions can result from uncontrolled chain branching steps.\nIf it is not possible to identify propagation steps in a reaction mechanism, then the mechanism consists of an open sequence of reaction steps. Open sequence mechanisms are a little less common than closed sequences. The reason has to do with the energy required for a reaction to take place. If, for example, in a chain reaction mechanism, the initiation step requires a significant energy input, but the propagation steps do not, the apparent, non-elementary reaction is able to proceed with relative ease because the initiation step only needs to occur a small number of times. In contrast, if one step in an open sequence of steps requires a significant energy input, that amount of energy will be required every time the apparent, non-elementary reaction takes place.\nReagents participate in a chemical reaction according to a fixed stoichiometry. For example every time one H2 molecule participates in reaction 5.2, one Br2 molecules also participates and two HBr molecules are produced. The propagation steps in a chain reaction mechanism, and all of the steps in an open sequence reaction mechanism, must obey a similar kind of stoichiometry. For example, each time the apparent, non-elementary HBr synthesis reaction occurs, each of the propagation steps, 5.4 and 5.5, must occur one time. The stoichiometric number, \\(\\sigma_j\\), of mechanistic step \\(j\\) (not to be confused with a stoichiometric coefficient, \\(\\nu_{i,j}\\)) is defined as the number of times mechanistic step \\(j\\) must occur when the apparent, non-elementary reaction occurs one time. Put differently, in the linear combination of the mechanistic steps that equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction, the coefficient that multiplies each mechanistic step is the stoichiometric number of that step. Thus, the stoichiometric numbers of steps 5.4 and 5.5 are each equal to 1. For some steps in a reaction mechanism, it is not possible to assign a unique stoichiometric number. For example, the initiation and terminations steps above, reactions 5.3 and 5.6, do not have unique stoichiometric numbers.\nIdentifying the types of reactions in a chain reaction mechanism and ensuring that the mechanism satisfies the rule that there must be some linear combination of the mechanistic steps that exactly equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction is illustrated in Example 5.3.1.",

    "section": "5.2 Generating Rate Expressions from Mechanisms",
    "text": "5.2 Generating Rate Expressions from Mechanisms\nOnce a proposed mechanism has been checked to make sure it obeys the rules given above, it can be used to generate an expression for the apparent rate of generation of a reactant or product in the corresponding non-elementary reaction. Specifically, the apparent net rate of generation of species \\(i\\) in the overall macroscopically observed reaction, \\(j\\), will be the sum of its rates of generation in each of the mechanistic steps. That is, the apparent rate of generation of \\(i\\) via the non-elementary reaction, \\(j\\), is given by Equation 5.7. Because the steps are elementary, their rates are given by Equation 5.1, leading to Equation 5.8 as the expression for the apparent rate of generation of \\(i\\) via non-elementary reaction \\(j\\). In Reaction Engineering Basics, such rate expressions are referred to as mechanistic rate expressions. Examples 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5 illustrate the use of Equations 5.7 and 5.8 in problems involving the generation of a rate expression from a mechanism.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} =\\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.7}\\]\n\\[\nr_{i,j} = \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\left(k_{j^\\prime,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,j^\\prime}} - k_{j^\\prime,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{\\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},j^\\prime}} \\right)\n\\tag{5.8}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) is a reactant or product in the non-elementary reaction \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the steps in the mechanism for non-elementary\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\) reaction \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the reactants in mechanistic step \\(j^\\prime\\), and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the products in mechanistic step \\(j^\\prime\\).\nIt is important to note that \\(i\\) in Equations 5.7 and 5.8, can be any reactant or product in the apparent, non-elementary reaction, \\(j\\). The resulting rates of generation of reagent \\(i\\) via non-elementary reaction \\(j\\) will all be stoichiometrically equivalent.\nGenerally Equation 5.8 leads to a mechanistic rate expression that is not very useful for reaction engineering purposes. Specifically, the resulting mechanistic rate expression will contain several terms, and it will include concentrations of reactive intermediates. The latter are present in a real system in very small concentrations. These concentrations are typically unknown, and they are very difficult to measure accurately. That makes it difficult to use a mechanistic rate expression in its initial form and makes it desirable to simplify it and eliminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from it. Simplification is accomplished by making different assumptions. Of course, the resulting simplified rate expression will only be valid if the assumptions are valid and if the underlying mechanism is correct.\nIt is sometimes observed that the rate of one particular mechanistic step has virtually no effect upon the apparent rate of the macroscopically observed reaction. Steps of this kind can be referred to as kinetically insignificant steps. This leads to an assumption that can be used to simplify a mechanistic rate expression. If a mechanistic step is assumed to be kinetically insignificant, its rate can be set equal to zero as shown in Equation 5.9. Example 5.3.2 shows the use of Equation 5.9 during the generation of mechanistic rate expression.\n\\[\nr_{j,\\text{insig}} = 0\n\\tag{5.9}\\]\nSimilarly, it is sometimes observed that the rate in the reverse direction of a particular step is very small compared to its forward rate or that the step is thermodynamically able to go essentially to completion. In other words, it is an effectively irreversible step. If a mechanistic step is assumed to be effectively irreversible, the term corresponding to its rate in the reverse direction in Equation 5.1, is set equal to zero as shown in Equation 5.10. Examples 5.3.1, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5 illustrate the use of Equation 5.10.\n\\[\nr_{j,\\text{irrev}} = k_{j,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime} \\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}}\n\\tag{5.10}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the reactants in mechanistic step \\(j\\).\n\n5.2.1 The Bodenstein Steady State Approximation\nBodenstein, M. and Lind, S. C. (1907) suggested an assumption related to reactive intermediates appearing in a reaction mechanism. As noted previously, reactive intermediates will be present at very low concentrations. This is a consequence of their high reactivity. As the reaction begins, the concentration of these species increases, but because they are so reactive, those intermediates formed undergo subsequent reaction very rapidly. In this way a steady state is quickly established whereby the rate at which reactive intermediates are being formed equals the rate at which they are undergoing subsequent reaction. Hence their concentration becomes constant and the overall rate of generation of the reactive intermediates becomes equal to zero. When the concentration of a species does not change over time, that concentration is said to be at steady state. For reactive intermediates, one can assume that this steady state condition always exists, ignoring the brief time required for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates to build up to their steady state values. This is known as the Bodenstein steady state approximation. To apply the steady state approximation, the rate of generation of each reactive intermediate via the non-elementary reaction is set equal to zero, as shown in Equation 5.11. Examples 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5 illustrate the use the Bodenstein steady state approximation in problems involving the generation of a rate expression from a mechanism.\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{RI,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.11}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the steps in the reaction mechanism.\nIf there are \\(N\\) reactive intermediates in the mechanism, then Equation 5.11 can be used once for each intermediate. This results in a set of \\(N\\) algebraic equations. This set of \\(N\\) equations can be solved for the concentrations of the \\(N\\) reactive intermediates in terms of the rate coefficients in the mechanism and the concentrations of stable species such as the reactants and products of the apparent, non-elementary reaction. The resulting expressions for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates can be substituted back into the mechanistic rate expression from Equation 5.8. After doing so, the mechanistic rate expression for the apparent, non-elementary reaction will no longer contain concentrations of reactive intermediates, and it will be much more useful for reaction engineering purposes. This process is illustrated in Examples 5.3.4 and 5.3.5.\n\n\n5.2.2 Rate Determining Step\nSometimes one step in the mechanism is much more difficult or demanding than any of the other steps. This step introduces a bottleneck in the reaction kinetics; if the rate of this one step were somehow increased, the net rates of all the other steps and the observed overall rate would increase proportionally. This kind of step is referred to as a rate-determining step or a rate-limiting step. In situations where there is a rate-determining step, the rate expression can often be simplified considerably by making the assumption that the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction, \\(r_j\\), is equal to the rate of the rate-determining step, \\(r_{rds}\\), as shown in Equation 5.12. Note that \\(r_j\\) in Equation 5.12 is the apparent general rate of the non-elementary reaction, \\(j\\); it is not a species generation rate. It is important to recognize that not all mechanisms have a rate-determining step. The assumption of a rate-determining step during the generation of a rate expression from a mechanism is illustrated in Examples 5.3.3, 5.3.6, and 5.3.7.\n\\[\nr_j = r_{rds} = k_{rds,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,rds}} - k_{rds,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{\\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},rds}}\n\\tag{5.12}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the reactants in the rate-determining step and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the products in the rate-determining step.\nIt is often stated that the rate determining step is the slowest step in the mechanism, but this is not an accurate statement. When the steps all have the same stoichiometric number (see above), then every step in the mechanism proceeds at the same net rate. If the rate determining step was much slower than the steps before it, then the concentrations of the reactants of the rate-determining step would continually build up. Eventually, the concentrations of the reactants of the rate-determining step would become sufficiently large to be observed macroscopically. At that point, it would no longer appear from a macroscopic perspective, that only the non-elementary reaction was taking place. It is more accurate to say that the rate-determining step is the kinetic bottleneck or that it is the most demanding step, than to incorrectly state that it is the slowest step. Its rate determines the rates of all the other mechanistic steps.\nThe concept of one step being more difficult or demanding can be put in more scientific terms. Recall that multiplying each mechanistic step by its stoichiometric number and summing yields the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Since free energy is a state function, the sum of the free energy change for each mechanistic step multiplied by the stoichiometric number of that step is equal to the free energy change for the apparent, non-elementary reaction, as expressed in Equation 5.13. If there is one mechanistic step wherein essentially all of the overall free energy change takes place, that one step is the rate-determining step, Equation 5.14. Since essentially all of the free energy change occurs in the rate-determining step, the free energy change for the other steps is essentially zero, Equation 5.15. Note, again, that there does not have to be a rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism.\n\\[\n\\Delta G_j = \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\sigma_{j^\\prime} \\Delta G_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.13}\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta G_j = \\sigma_{rds} \\Delta G_{rds}\n\\tag{5.14}\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta G_{nrd} \\approx 0\n\\tag{5.15}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the steps in the mechanism for non-elementary\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\) reaction \\(j\\)\nIf a rate-determining step exists for a particular reaction mechanism, there is another consequence. Since the free energy changes for all steps other than the rate-determining step are essentially zero, it may be assumed that all steps other than the rate-determining step reach a state of quasi-equilibrium. (Recall from thermodynamics that by definition, the free energy change for a process at thermodynamic equilibrium is equal to zero.) This is expressed in Equation 5.16.\n\\[\nK_{nrd} = \\prod_i \\left[i\\right]^{\\nu_{i,nrd}}\n\\tag{5.16}\\]\nNote that the rate expression that results from the application of Equation 5.12 is likely to include the concentration of one or more reactive intermediates, and if it does, it is not suitable for many reaction engineering purposes. In those cases, however, the quasi-equilibration assumption, Equation 5.16, can be applied to all other steps. The resulting equilibrium expressions can be solved for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates in terms of the concentrations of the reactants, products and the equilibrium constants for the steps other than the rate-determining step. Upon substitution into Equation 5.12, a rate expression more suitable for reaction engineering purposes results. The use of the assumption that steps other than the rate-determining step are quasi-equilibrated is illustrated in Examples 5.3.3, 5.3.6, and 5.3.7.\nRate expressions that are derived with the assumption of a rate-determining step will only apply for environmental conditions that are far from equilibrium. Recall that the free energy change due to the rate-determining step is equal to the overall free energy change. However, as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium the overall free energy change approaches zero (by definition) and the free energy change for every step approaches zero (according to the principle of microscopic reversibility). Thus, as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium it is no longer possible to identify a rate-determining step, and as a consequence, rate expressions that are derived with the assumption of a rate-determining step will only apply for environmental conditions that are far from equilibrium.\n\n\n5.2.3 Homogeneous Catalytic and Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms\nRecall that a catalyst is a material that causes the rate of one or more chemical reactions to increase, but the catalyst itself is not a reactant or product of the apparent non-elementary reaction. In some cases, the catalyst is present within the same phase as the reacting fluid. In this case the catalyst is referred to as a homogeneous catalyst. For present purposes, an enzyme may be considered to be a homogeneous catalyst for biological reactions, and for the remainder of this sub-section any discussion concerning catalysts also applies to enzymes unless noted otherwise.\nIn mechanisms for catalytic reactions, the catalyst appears in several different chemical forms. That is, some of the catalyst will be free (not bonded to anything), while some catalyst will be complexed (chemically bound) with reactants, products, or other species. Each of the chemical forms of the catalyst can be treated as a reactive intermediate because it appears in the reaction mechanism, but not in the apparent, non-elementary reaction. The concentrations of the various chemical forms of the catalyst can be difficult to measure, making it desirable to eliminate them from mechanistic rate expressions using either the steady-state approximation or, when there is rate-determining step in the mechanism, quasi-equilibrium assumptions.\nThe presence of a catalyst leads to an additional complication when simplifying a mechanistic rate expression. When the Bodenstein steady state approximation is applied to each of the chemical forms of the catalyst, it is found that the resulting equations cannot be solved to obtain expressions for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates as is done for non-catalytic mechanisms. The reason is that when the free catalyst and all the complexes it forms are treated as a reactive intermediates, the equations generated using the Bodenstein steady state approximation are not mathematically independent. One of the Bodenstein steady state equations must be replaced.\nThe equation that replaces one of the Bodenstein steady state equations is an expression for the conservation of catalyst. While the concentrations of the various chemical forms of the catalyst aren’t known, the total amount of catalyst originally added to the system usually is known, and it is a constant. Since catalyst is not generated nor consumed by reaction, the sum of the concentrations of all forms of the catalyst (free, reactant-complexed, intermediate-complexed, and product-complexed) must equal the known total concentration of catalyst. This is expressed in Equation 5.17 where \\(\\kappa_{i^\\prime}\\) is the number of catalyst species in the form originally added to the system that are needed to create one complex of the catalyst with species \\(i^\\prime\\). When one of the Bodenstein steady state equations is replaced by Equation 5.17, the resulting set of equations is mathematically independent. They can be solved to obtain expressions for the concentration of each reactive intermediate in terms of only rate coefficients, concentrations of stable species and the total concentration of the catalyst in its initial form, \\(C_{0,cat}\\). The amount of catalyst originally added to the system, \\(C_{0,cat}\\), is a known constant, so its presence in the rate expression is acceptable. The use of Equation 5.17 is illustrated in Examples 5.3.4 and 5.3.5.\n\\[\nC_{0,cat} = C_{cat,free} + \\sum_{i^\\prime}\\kappa_{i^\\prime}C_{i^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.17}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes all complexed forms of the catalyst.\nA similar complication can arise for either catalytic or non-catalytic reactions if the mechanism involves ionic species. In that case, similar to requiring the total amount of catalyst to be conserved, charge conservation must be enforced. If the reacting solution is uncharged, this means that the sum of the amounts of all positively charged species multiplied by their respective charges must equal the sum of the amounts of all negatively charged species multiplied by their respective charges, as expressed in Equation 5.18. That equation can then be used to replace one of the Bodenstein steady state equations, leading to a mathematically independent set of equations.\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{i+} C_{i+}q_{i+} + \\sum_{i-} C_{i-}q_{i-}\n\\tag{5.18}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i+\\) indexes the positively charged species in the system, and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i-\\) indexes the negatively charged species in the system.\nWhile enzyme catalysis and homogeneous chemical catalysis are the same in many respects, there are some differences. The term “substrate” is typically used instead of “reactant”. In catalytic systems, a reagent that binds with the catalyst and renders it catalytically inactive is called a catalyst poision. The equivalent in an enzymatic reaction is called an enzyme inhibitor. Typically an enzyme is a large molecule that has many twists and folds in its structure, and the catalysis associated with the enzyme takes place when the substrate binds to one particular location within the overall structure. Inhibitors are often molecules that also bind to the particular location where the catalysis takes place. When an inhibitor molecule is bound in this way, the enzyme becomes catalytically inactive until such time that the inhibitor releases from it. In addition to inhibition, some enzymes require cofactor molecules. A cofactor molecule is often a relatively small inorganic molecule that has the effect of activating an enzyme when it binds to it. That is, the enzyme alone is not active, but when a cofactor binds to it, it becomes catalytically active.\nIn terms of simplifying mechanistic rate expressions, the concentrations of poisons, inhibitors, and cofactors that are not complexed with a catalyst or enzyme is often easily measured. In this case, it is acceptable for reaction engineering purposes for the concentrations of uncomplexed poisons, inhibitors, and cofactors to appear in the rate expression for the apparent, non-elementary reaction. If, for some reason, the presence of these concentrations in the rate expression was undesirable, the poision, inhibitor, or cofactor could be treated as a conserved species. Doing so would lead to their total concentration appearing in the rate expression instead of the concentration of the uncomplexed form. In any case, it is not acceptable for the concentration of a poison, inhibitor or cofactor that is complexed to the catalyst to appear in the rate expression for the non-elementary reaction. Generation of a mechanistic rate expression when the mechanism includes an inhibitor is illustrated in Example 5.3.5.\n\n\n5.2.4 Heterogeneous Catalytic Reaction Mechanisms\nMany industrial processes utilize heterogeneous catalysts; they are a separate phase that is in contact with the reacting fluid. Most typically the catalyst is solid while the reagents are in a gaseous or liquid phase. The reaction actually takes place on the surface of the catalyst at specific locations called active sites. When writing a mechanistic step that involves an active site, it is common to use some type of star to represent the site, e. g. \\(\\ast\\). Reactants, intermediates and products can bond to these sites in much the same way as they can form complexes with homogeneous catalysts or enzymes. In heterogeneous catalysis, the bonding of a species in the reacting fluid phase to an active site on the surface of the catalyst is a process referred to as adsorption, and the surface complexes that are generated are called adsorbed species. The reverse process, where a species leaves the surface and enters the fluid phase is called desorption.\nIn simple situations, it is usually safe to assume that the total surface area of the heterogeneous catalyst remains constant during the course of the reaction. It can also be safely assumed that the number (and therefore the concentration) of active sites, \\(C_{\\text{sites}}\\), remains constant. Note that this is a two-dimensional concentration (sites per surface area) not a three-dimensional one (sites per volume). In heterogeneous catalytic kinetics, the concentration of an adsorbed species, \\(k\\) is usually expressed in terms of the fraction of the total sites that it covers, \\(\\theta_k\\). This quantity is then referred to as the fractional coverage or the surface coverage of surface species \\(k\\). When this is done, the concentration, \\(C_k\\) of any surface species adsorbed on a single site is given by Equation 5.19.\n\\[\nC_k = C_{\\text{sites}} \\theta_k\n\\tag{5.19}\\]\nTransition state theory can be used to derive the mathematical form of rate expressions for an elementary surface reaction. When this is done, the concentration of sites, \\(C_{\\text{sites}}\\), can be combined with the pre-exponential factor of the rate coefficient. After doing so, the resulting rate expression for an elementary surface reaction is given in Equation 5.20.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{j,f}\\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime  \\right]^{- \\nu_{i^\\prime,j}} \\prod_{k^\\prime}\\theta_{k^\\prime}^{- \\nu_{k^\\prime,j}} \\\\\n&- k_{j,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{ \\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},j} }\\prod_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}\\theta_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}^{ \\nu_{k^{\\prime\\prime},j}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.20}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the fliud phase reactants in step \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^\\prime\\) indexes the surface reactants in step \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the fluid phase products in step \\(j\\), and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the surface products in step \\(j\\).\nNote that because the rate expression for a heterogeneous catalytic mechanistic step is different than those for non-catalytic, catalytic and enzymatic mechanistic steps, if there is a rate-determining step (rds) in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism, Equation 5.21 should be used in place of Equation 5.12 for the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction \\(j\\). Also, when equilibrium expressions are written for surface reactions, the fractional coverage of surface species replaces their concentration.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= r_{rds} \\\\\n&= k_{rds,f}\\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime  \\right]^{- \\nu_{i^\\prime,rds}} \\prod_{k^\\prime}\\theta_{k^\\prime}^{- \\nu_{k^\\prime,rds}} \\\\\n&- k_{rds,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{ \\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},rds} }\\prod_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}\\theta_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}^{ \\nu_{k^{\\prime\\prime},rds}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.21}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the fliud phase reactants in the rds,\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^\\prime\\) indexes the surface reactants in the rds,\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the fluid phase products in the rds, and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the surface products in the rds.\nFor reaction engineering purposes, it is not desirable to have a rate expression that contains surface coverages because they are typically unknown and difficult to measure. Therefore, the mechanistic rate expression is simplified using the Bodenstein steady state approximation or other valid assumptions. Similar to homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis, the heterogeneous catalytic sites are conserved, and one Bodenstein steady state equation must be replaced by an expression for the conservation of catalytic sites. In the case of heterogeneous catalysis, the conservation of catalytic sites takes the form shown in Equation 5.22.\n\\[\n1 = \\theta_{\\text{vacant}} + \\sum_k \\theta_k\n\\tag{5.22}\\]\nThe generation of a mechanistic rate expression from a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism is illustrated in Examples 5.3.6 and 5.3.7.\n\n\n5.2.5 Most Abundant Intermediate\nCatalytic reaction mechanisms (homogeneous, enzymatic or heterogeneous) are subtly different from non-catalytic reaction mechanisms. During non-catalytic reactions, the amount of every reactive intermediate is small. This makes their concentration difficult to measure, leading to the necessity to eliminate those concentrations from rate expressions for the non-elementary reaction. During catalytic reactions the total number of reactive intermediates is not necessarily small, it is determined by the amount of catalyst present. As a result, some of the intermediates in catalytic reactions will be present in significant amounts. Nonetheless, measuring the concentrations of those intermediates is still very difficult, so it is common to eliminate their concentrations from mechanistic rate expressions. That is, even though their concentration may be greater than reactive intermediates in non-catalytic reactions, the non-complexed catalyst and each complexed form of a catalyst or enzyme is treated as a reactive intermediate. This also applies to vacant sites and each adsorbed surface species in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism.\nAs a consequence of the larger concentrations of catalytic intermediates, it is possible that during reaction, most of the catalyst, enzyme or catalyst sites are complexed with one reagent. If so, that complex is called the most abundant intermediate. Mathematically, when there is a most abundant intermediate, Equation 5.23 applies for a homogeneous catalytic or enzymatic mechanism and Equation 5.24 applies for a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism. These inequalities can sometimes lead to additional simplification of the apparent rate expression for the non-elementary reaction. This happens when the apparent rate expression has a denominator with several terms. When there is a most-abundant intermediate, some of the terms in these denominators may be much smaller than others and so can be deleted without affecting the accuracy of the rate expression. The simplification of a mechanistic rate expression when there is a most abundant intermediate in the mechanism is illustrated in Example 5.3.7.\n\\[\nC_{ma} \\gg C_{nma}\n\\tag{5.23}\\]\n\\[\n\\theta_{ma} \\gg \\theta_{nma}\n\\tag{5.24}\\]",

    "text": "5.3 Examples\nAll of the examples included in Chapter 5 can be classified as “mechanism problems.” Each example begins with a problem statement. Immediately following the problem statement there is a green “expert thinking” callout. like the one at the end of this paragraph. By default the content of these callouts is hidden. Clicking on the callout opens it and shows its content. The intention of these callouts is to provide some insight into what an expert might be thinking after reading the problem statement as they ponder how to solve the problem. To reduce the amount of duplication, the callout below presents general expert thinking that applies to every example in Chapter 5. The individual expert thinking callouts in each of the examples then provide thinking specific to that problem. In other words, the reader should mentally insert the content of this callout at the start of all of the remaining expert thinking callouts in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking after Reading each Problem Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I call a “mechanism problem.” Its characteristic features are that it identifies a non-elementary reaction, provides a mechanism for that reaction, and asks for an expression for the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction. I’ve learned that solving this type of problem has two parts. The first part is to express the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction in terms of the rates of the steps in the mechanism. If there is a rate-determining step in the mechanism and there is not a heterogeneous catalyst, Equation 5.12 is used to do this. If there is a rate-determining step in the mechanism and there is a heterogeneous catalyst, Equation 5.21 is used. If there is not a rate-determining step, Equation 5.7 is used.\nThe second part involves eliminating concentrations of reactive intermediates, concentrations of catalyst complexes or heterogeneous catalyst surface coverages from the apparent rate expression. (Note in the present context, “catalyst complexes” includes the free catalyst as well as each of its complexed forms, and “surface species” includes the vacant site as well as each adsorbed species adsorbed on the surface.)\nIf (a) there is a rate-determining step in the mechanism, this is done by writing Equation 5.16 (quasi-equilibrium expressions) for all the other steps. If there is a homogeneous catalyst or an enzyme in the mechanism, Equation 5.17 is added to the set of quasi-equilibrium expressions. Alternatively, if there is a heterogeneous catalyst in the mechanism, Equation 5.22 is added to the set of quasi-equilibrium expressions.\nIf (b) there is not a rate-determining step, Equation 5.11 (the Bodenstein steady state approximation) is used to eliminate the concentrations of reactive intermediates, catalyst complexes or surface species coverages from the apparent rate expression. If the mechanism does not involve any type of catalyst or enzyme, Equation 5.11 is written for each reactive intermediate appearing in the reaction mechanism. If there is a homogeneous catalyst or an enzyme in the mechanism, Equation 5.11 is written for all but one catalyst complex and Equation 5.17 (the catalyst conservation expression) is added to the set of Bodenstein steady state expressions. If there is a heterogeneous catalyst in the mechanism, Equation 5.11 is written for all but one surface species and Equation 5.22 (the surface site conservation expression) is added to the set of Bodenstein steady state approximations.\nIn either case (a) or case (b), the resulting set of equations is then solved to obtain expressions for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates, the concentrations of the catalyst complexes, or the heterogeneous catalyst surface coverages. Then the results can be used to eliminate the concentrations of the reactive intermediates, catalyst complexes or surface coverages from the apparent rate expression.\n\n\n\nFollowing the expert thinking callout in each example, a concise formulation of the problem solution is presented. The formulations contain multiple instances of “where did that come from” callouts. By default, the contents of these callouts is also hidden. These callouts provide added detail about how the equations they follow were generated. The idea is that with the content of all of the callouts hidden, the reader can see the solution in a very concise format, but if the reader does not perceive where certain equations came from, they can open the corresponding callout to see more details.\n\n5.3.1 Validity, Classification of Steps and Mechanistic Rate Expression for a Chain Reaction Mechanism\nSuppose that nitrogen oxidation, equation (1), occurs via the chain reaction mechanism given in equations (2) through (5). Classify each of the mechanistic steps as initiation/termination, propagation, chain branching or chain transfer; show that there is a linear combination of equations (2) through (5) that is equal to equation (1); and write, but do not simplify, the expression for the apparent rate of non-elementary reaction (1) that is predicted by the mechanism. Discuss the suitability of the resulting rate expression for reaction engineering purposes.\n\\[\nN_2 + O_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 NO \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nO_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 O \\cdot \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nO \\cdot + N_2 \\rightleftarrows NO + N \\cdot \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nN \\cdot + O_2 \\rightleftarrows NO + O \\cdot \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 N \\cdot \\rightleftarrows N_2\\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a mechanism problem. The problem asks me to classify each step in the mechanism. I can do that knowing that initiation steps have no reactive intermediates as reactants and one or more reactive intermediates as products, while termination steps have one or more reactive intermediates as reactants and no reactive intermediates as products. Propagation steps have one reactive intermediate among the reactants and a different reactive intermediate among the products. Chain branching steps have one reactive intermediate among the reactants and two reactive intermediates among the products. Chain transfer steps are usually found in polymerization reactions, so I don’t expect to find any chain transfer steps in this mechanism.\nThe problem next asks me to show that there is a linear combination of the steps that equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction. I know that in chain mechanisms that linear combination usually involves only the propagation steps. For simple mechanisms like those considered in Reaction Engineering Basics, the necessary linear combination can usually be found by inspection.\nFinally, the problem asks me to write the generalized rate expression predicted by the mechanism. This mechanism does not have a rate-determining step, so I’ll set the rate of generation of a reactant or product in the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of its rates of generation in the mechanistic steps. In order to do that I need to identify the reactive intermediates. The reactive intermediates are the reagents that appear in one or more mechanistic steps, but they do not appear in the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Here I can see that N2, O2, and NO appear in the apparent, non-elementary reaction, so they are not reactive intermediates. The only other reagents that I see in the mechanism (reactions (2) through (5)) are N∙ and O∙, so they are the reactive intermediates.\n\n\n\nInitiation/Termination Steps: Steps (2) and (5)\nPropagation Steps: Steps (3) and (4)\nBy inspection it can be seen that adding steps (3) and (4) yields the apparent, non-elementary reaction, reaction (1).\nReactive Intermediates: \\(N \\cdot\\), \\(O \\cdot\\)\nApparent Rate Expression\nSetting the apparent rate of generation of NO in the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of its rates of generation in each of the mechanistic steps yields equation (6).\n\\[\nr_{NO,1} = r_3 + r_4 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart from Equation 5.7.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} =\\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\nI’ve chosen to generate an expression for the apparent generation of NO in the non-elementary reaction (1), so \\(i = NO\\) and \\(j = 1\\).

When writing those mole and energy balances, the reaction engineer will not know the reaction mechanism; the reaction engineer will only know that reaction (1) takes place and that equation (10) is the rate expression for reaction (1).\nThe mole and energy balances will include variables for the amounts of N2, O2, and NO, but they will not include variables for the amounts of N∙ and O∙. Furthermore, there is no way to calculate the concentrations of N∙ and O∙ because they are not stoichiometrically related to the concentrations of N2, O2, and NO. Without concentrations of N∙ and O∙, it is not possible to evaluate the reaction rate, and consequently the reaction engineer will not be able to solve the mole and energy balances on the reactor.\nFor this reason, the initial form of rate expressions generated from mechanisms is not useful for reaction engineering purposes. In order to perform reaction engineering tasks, the rate expression must be simplified so that it does not contain concentrations of reactive intermediates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction engineer could use an alternative approach if the mechanism was known. Instead of assuming that only the apparent, non-elementary reaction takes place, the reaction engineer could assume that reactions (2) through (5) occur in the reactor. In that case, the mole and energy balances would include variables for the amounts of the reactive intermediates and it would be possible to evaluate the rates of the reactions.\nHowever, that approach introduces a different problem. If the mechanistic reactions are used, the rate expressions for each of the mechanistic steps are needed. That means, for example, that experiments would need to be performed to find the values of \\(k_{3,f}\\), and \\(k_{3,r}\\) in equation (7). Performing those experiments would require setting and/or measuring the concentrations of N∙ and O∙. Because N∙ and O∙ are highly reactive, setting and measuring their concentrations is very difficult. In other words, the difficult and demanding task of estimating the values of the kinetics parameters in the mechanistic rate expressions would be necessary if the reaction engineer opted for this alternative approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Mechanistic Rate Expression for HBr Synthesis using the Bodenstein Steady State Approximation\nIn the mechanism for synthesis of HBr given below, assume step (4) is effectively irreversible and step (5) is kinetically insignificant. Use the Bodenstein steady-state approximation to derive a mechanistic rate expression for the apparent rate of generation of HBr via non-elementary reaction (1). Simplify the mechanism so that it contains only partial pressures of stable species and not those of reactive intermediates.

I see that H2, Br2, and HBr all appear in the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Looking at the mechanism proposed in reactions (2) through (5), I see that H∙ and Br∙ also appear, so they are the reactive intermediates.\nThis mechanism does not include a rate-determining step, so I will use Equation 5.7 to write the rate of generation of a reactant or product in the non-elementary reaction in terms of the rates of the mechanistic steps.

Substitution of those results into the rate expression yields a mechanistic rate expression for the apparent rate of generation of HBr via non-elementary reaction (1), as shown in equation (15).\n\\[\n\\left[ Br \\cdot \\right] = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\sqrt{\\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left[ H \\cdot \\right] = \\frac{k_{3,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\sqrt{\\left[ Br_2 \\right]}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{k_{3,r}\\left[ HBr\\right] + k_{4,f}\\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{HBr,1} = 2\\frac{k_{3,f}k_{4,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\left[ Br_2 \\right]^{3/2}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{k_{3,r}\\left[ HBr\\right] + k_{4,f}\\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{15}\n\\]\nBefore the rate expression in equation (15) could be used, it would be necessary to estimate the values of the kinetics parameters appearing in it. Using experimental data where the concentrations or partial pressures of H2, Br2 and HBr were varied and the corresponding values of the rate were measured, it would not be possible to obtain unique values for each of the five rate coefficients. This can be seen most easily by dividing the numerator and denominator of equation (15) by \\(k_{4,f}\\) as shown in equation (16).\n\\[\nr_{HBr,1} = 2\\frac{k_{3,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\left[ Br_2 \\right]^{3/2}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{\\frac{k_{3,r}}{k_{4,f}}\\left[ HBr\\right] + \\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{16}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(k_{2,f}\\), \\(k_{2,r}\\), and \\(k_{3,f}\\) do not appear individually in the rate expression. They only appear together as the term, \\(k\\), defined in equation (17). Similarly, \\(k_{3,r}\\) and \\(k_{4,f}\\) do not appear individually, but only together as the term, \\(k^\\prime\\), defined in equation (18). Consequently, the rate expression can be written as shown in equation (19).\n\\[\nk = k_{3,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\nk^\\prime = \\frac{k_{3,r}}{k_{4,f}} \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{HBr,1} = 2\\frac{k \\left[ Br_2 \\right]^{3/2}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{k^\\prime\\left[ HBr\\right] + \\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{19}\n\\]\nStatistical parameter estimation methods can be employed to find unique “best” values for \\(k\\) and \\(k^\\prime\\). Looking at equation (17), it can be seen that arbitrary values can be selected for any two of the three rate coefficients, \\(k_{2,f}\\), \\(k_{2,r}\\), and \\(k_{3,f}\\). As long as the value of the third rate coefficient was chosen so that \\(k\\) was equal to its “best” value, the rate expression in equation (16) would be equally accurate. Thus, \\(k_{2,f}\\), \\(k_{2,r}\\), and \\(k_{3,f}\\) are coupled. An infinite number of sets of values could be used and the accuracy of the rate expression would not change. The rate coefficients, \\(k_{3,r}\\) and \\(k_{4,f}\\), are similarly coupled. Whenever possible, coupled kinetics parameters in mechanistic rate expressions should be combined into a single parameter for which a unique value can be estimated. Put differently, for reaction engineering purposes, rate expression (19) is preferred over rate expression (16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coupled rate coefficients in this problem appeared in a term where they were multiplied, divided and raised to a constant power (here, the power was 1/2 corresponding to the square root). When rate coefficients are combined in this way, the combined parameters, \\(k\\) and \\(k^\\prime\\) in this case, will display Arrhenius temperature dependence and long as the original rate coefficients did so.\nIf rate coefficients are added or subtracted, this will not be true. That is, if \\(k = k_1 + k_2\\), the combined rate coefficient \\(k\\) will not display Arrhenius temperature dependence, even if \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) each do display Arrhenius temperature dependence.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Mechanistic Rate Expression from a Mechanism with a Rate-Determining Step\nSuppose that iodopropane disproportionates to produce iodine according to the apparent non-elementary reaction (1).

In problems with enzymes (or with homogeneous catalysts), each form of the enzyme is treated the same way reactive intermediates are treated, so for this problem the reactive intermediates are the free (uncomplexed) enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex.\nSince there isn’t a rate-determining step, I will need to choose a reagent in the non-elementary reaction and set the apparent rate of generation of that reagent via the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of the rates at which it is generated in each mechanistic step. In this problem, I’ll do this for the product, P, since it only appears in one step in the mechanism.\nThere are two reactive intermediates, but if I wrote the Bodenstein steady state approximation for both of them, the equations would not be mathematically independent because the mechanism includes an enzyme. I know that in this situation I need to write the Bodenstein steady state approximation for all but one of the reactive intermediates and then add an equation for the conservation of catalyts.

They defined two kinetics parameters, \\(V_{max}\\) and \\(K_m\\), as shown in equations (12) and (13). Substitution of those definitions in equation (11) yields the so-called Michaelis-Menten rate expression, equation (14).\n\n\\[\nV_{max} = k_{3,f} E_0 \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_m = \\frac{k_{2,r} + k_{3,f}}{k_{2,f}} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{P,1} = \\frac{V_{max} \\left[ S \\right]}{K_m + \\left[ S \\right]} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\nThe Michaelis-Menten rate expression above is non-linear with respect to the kinetics parameters. The parameters, \\(V_{max}\\) and \\(K_m\\), can be estimated using experimental kinetics data together with software for fitting non-linear models to data. Notice, however, that if the reciprocals of the two sides of the equation are set equal to each other as shown in equation (15), a linear model results. Specifically, defining \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) as shown in equations (16) and (17), it can be seen that the model has the linear form shown in equation (18) where the slope, \\(m\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), are given in equations (19) and (20).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_{P,1}} = \\left( \\frac{K_m}{V_{max}}  \\right) \\frac{1}{\\left[ S \\right]} + \\frac{1}{V_{max}} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{r_{P,1}} \\tag{16}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{\\left[ S \\right]} \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = mx + b \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nm = \\frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \\tag{19}\n\\]\n\\[\nb = \\frac{1}{V_{max}} \\tag{20}\n\\]\nAs was the case when the Arrhenius expression was linearized (see the note at the end of Example 4.5.4), a spreadsheet program could be used to create a plot of \\(\\frac{1}{r_{P,1}}\\) vs. \\(\\frac{1}{\\left[ S \\right]}\\). A plot of this type was used by Lineweaver and Burk (1934), and today plots of the type are commonly called Lineweaver-Burk plots. By adding a trendline to the Lineweaver-Burk plot, the best estimates for \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) will be obtained. As equation (20) shows, the best estimate for \\(V_{max}\\) is equal to the reciprocal of the best estimate for \\(b\\). Then, as equation (19) shows, the best estimate for \\(K_m\\) is equal to the best estimate for \\(m\\) multiplied by \\(V_{max}\\).\nIt can be noted in equation (13) that \\(K_m\\) includes the sum of two rate coefficients. As such, \\(K_m\\) will not display Arrhenius temperature dependence if it is measured over a sufficiently broad range of temperatures. Fortunately, enzymes are often active only in a narrow range of temperatures, and this does not become a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.5 Mechanistic Rate Expression from an Enzymatic Mechanism with an Inhibitor\nSuppose that enzyme E catalyzes the conversion of substrate S to product P, but if the reagent I is present in the system, it inhibits the enzyme. The apparent reaction is shown in equation (1), and the proposed mechanism consists of reactions (2) through (4).\n\\[\nS \\rightleftarrows P \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nE + S \\rightleftarrows E\\!\\!-\\!\\!S \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nE + I \\rightleftarrows E\\!\\!-\\!\\!I \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nE\\!\\!-\\!\\!S \\rightleftarrows E + P \\tag{4}\n\\]\nAssume that step (4) is effectively irreversible and derive a Michaelis-Menten type of rate expression for this system that is suitable for reaction engineering purposes (i. e. that does not contain concentrations of reactive intermediates). You may assume that the concentration of the free inhibitor can be easily measured, so that its presence in the rate expression is acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is again a mechanism problem that includes an enzyme and does not have a rate determining step. In mechanism problems that involve a homogeneous catalyst or an enzyme, the free and compelexed forms of the catalyst or enzyme are treated like reactive intermediates. Thus, in this problem the reactive intermediates are E, E-S and E-I.\nSince there isn’t a rate-determining step, I will choose a reagent from the apparent reaction and set its apparent rate of generation in the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of its rates of generation in the mechanistic steps. Here I will do this for P because it only appear in one mechanistic step.\nTo eliminate the concentrations of reactive intermediates from the rate expressions, I’ll write the Bodenstein steady state approximation for two of the three reactive intermediates. The Bodenstein steady state approximation for the third reactive intermediate would not be mathematically independent, so I will replace it with an expression for the conservation of catalyst. The resulting set of three equations can be solved to obtain expressions for the concentrations of the three reactive intermediates. Those expressions can then be used to eliminate the concentrations of reactive intermediates from the rate expression.\n\n\n\nReactive Intermediates: E, E-S, and E-I\nNecessary Equations\nSetting the apparent rate of generation of P equal to the sum of the rates at which P is generated in each of the mechanistic steps yields equation (5).\n\\[\nr_{P,1} = r_4 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 5.7.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} =\\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\nNoting that \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes all of the steps in the mechanism and setting \\(i=P\\) and \\(j=1\\) gives the expression for the apparent rate of generation of P via non-elementary reaction (1).\n\\[\nr_{P,1} = \\nu_{P,2}r_2 + \\nu_{P,3}r_3 + \\nu_{P,4}r_4\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{P,1} = \\left( 0 \\right)r_2 + \\left( 0 \\right)r_3 + \\left( 1 \\right)r_4\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{P,1} = r_4\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe mechanistic steps are elementary, so their rates are known, equations (6) through (8).\n\\[\nr_2 = k_{2,f} \\left[ E \\right] \\left[ S \\right] - k_{2,r} \\left[ E\\!-\\!S \\right] \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_3 = k_{3,f} \\left[ E \\right] \\left[ I \\right] - k_{3,r} \\left[ E\\!-\\!I \\right] \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_4 = k_{4,f} \\left[ E\\!-\\!S \\right] \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 5.1.\n\\[\nr_j = k_{j,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}} - k_{j,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{\\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},j}}\n\\]\nTo generate an expression for step (2), set \\(j=2\\) and note that \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes all of the reactants in the reaction and \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes all of the products in the reaction.

Consequently, the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction is equal to the rate of the rate-determining step as given in Equation 5.21.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= r_{rds} \\\\\n&= k_{rds,f}\\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime  \\right]^{- \\nu_{i^\\prime,rds}} \\prod_{k^\\prime}\\theta_{k^\\prime}^{- \\nu_{k^\\prime,rds}} \\\\\n&- k_{rds,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{ \\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},rds} }\\prod_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}\\theta_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}^{ \\nu_{k^{\\prime\\prime},rds}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo make the expression for the apparent rate of the heterogeneously catalyzed, non-elementary reaction useful for reaction engineering purposes, the fractional coverages must be eliminated from it.

They are named for Irving Langmuir, who developed models for adsorption equilibrium (Langmuir, I 1918), and Cyril Hinshelwood who used them to develop rate expressions for surface reactions.\nLangmuir-Hinshelwood rate expressions for heterogeneous catalytic reactions, Michaelis-Menten rate expressions for enzymatic reactions and general rate expressions for homogeneous catalytic reactions often take the form of a fraction. The numerator is typically a single positive term when the apparent reaction is irreversible or the difference between two terms when the apparent reaction is reversible. The denominator is typically the sum of several terms. Example 5.3.7 shows how the summation in the denominator in these rate expressions often reduces to a single term when the amount of one of the reactive intermediates is much greater than all the other reactiven intermediates.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7 Mechanistic Rate Expression from a Mechanism with a Most Abundant Intermediate\nThe oxidation of carbon monoxide, reaction (1) is heterogeneously catalyzed. A proposed reaction mechanism is shown in reactions (2) through (6). Assume that step (6) is rate-limiting and derive an expression for the apparent rate of reaction (1) that contains only partial pressures, rate coefficients and equilibrium constants. How does the apparent rate expression change if \\(O\\!-\\!\\ast\\) is the most abundant surface intermediate?\nOverall Reaction:\n\\[\n2 CO + O_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 CO_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\nProposed Mechanism: \\[\nO_2 + \\ast \\rightleftarrows O_2\\!-\\!\\ast \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO + O_2\\!-\\!\\ast \\rightleftarrows CO_3\\!-\\!\\ast \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO_3\\!-\\!\\ast \\rightleftarrows CO_2 + O\\!-\\!\\ast \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO + O\\!-\\!\\ast \\rightleftarrows CO_2\\!-\\!\\ast \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nCO_2\\!-\\!\\ast \\rightleftarrows CO_2 + \\ast \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mechanism has a rate-determining step and involves a heterogeneous catalyst. In that situation the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction is equal to the rate of the rate-determining step as given in Equation 5.21.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= r_{rds} \\\\\n&= k_{rds,f}\\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime  \\right]^{- \\nu_{i^\\prime,rds}} \\prod_{k^\\prime}\\theta_{k^\\prime}^{- \\nu_{k^\\prime,rds}} \\\\\n&- k_{rds,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{ \\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},rds} }\\prod_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}\\theta_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}^{ \\nu_{k^{\\prime\\prime},rds}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo make the apparent rate expression useful for reaction engineering purposes, all surface coverages must be eliminated from it. When there is a rate-determining step, quasi-equilibrium expressions for all other steps, Equation 5.16, are used.\n\\[\nK_{nrd} = \\prod_i \\left[i\\right]^{\\nu_{i,nrd}}\n\\]\nIn this problem there are 4 steps that are not rate-determining, and therefore 4 quasi-equilibrium expressions, but there are five surface species (\\(\\ast\\), \\(O_2\\!-\\!\\ast\\), \\(CO_3\\!-\\!\\ast\\), \\(O\\!-\\!\\ast\\), and \\(CO_2\\!-\\!\\ast\\)). An expression for the conservation of catalyst sites, Equation 5.22, provides a fifth equation.\n\\[\n1 = \\theta_{\\text{vacant}} + \\sum_k \\theta_k\n\\]\nThose five equations can be solved to get expressions for the surface coverages. Substitution of the surface coverage expressions into the rate expression then eliminates the surface coverages from the rate expression.\nIn the second part of this problem there is a most abundant surface intermediate. This allows four inequalities of the form given in Equation 5.24 to be written.\n\\[\n\\theta_{ma} \\gg \\theta_{nma}\n\\]\nSubstitution of the expressions for the surface coverages into these equalities followed by algebraic simplification may then show that some terms in the expression for the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction can be eliminated because they are negligible.\n\n\n\nReactive Intermediates: \\(\\ast\\), \\(O_2\\!-\\!\\ast\\), \\(CO_3\\!-\\!\\ast\\), \\(O\\!-\\!\\ast\\), and \\(CO_2\\!-\\!\\ast\\).\nNecessary Equations\nSetting the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction equal to the rate of the rate-determining step, (6) yields equation (7).\n\\[\nr_1 = r_6 = k_{6,f} \\theta_{CO_2} - k_{6,r} \\left[ CO_2 \\right] \\theta_{\\text{vacant}} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 5.21.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= r_{rds} \\\\\n&= k_{rds,f}\\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime  \\right]^{- \\nu_{i^\\prime,rds}} \\prod_{k^\\prime}\\theta_{k^\\prime}^{- \\nu_{k^\\prime,rds}} \\\\\n&- k_{rds,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{ \\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},rds} }\\prod_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}\\theta_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}^{ \\nu_{k^{\\prime\\prime},rds}}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor this problem, \\(j = 1\\), \\(rds = 6\\), there are no fluid phase reactants in the rds, so \\(i^\\prime\\) does not index anything, \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the only fluid phase product in the rds, CO2, \\(k^\\prime\\) indexes the only surface reactant in the rds, \\(CO_2\\!-\\!\\ast\\), and \\(k^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the only surface product in the rds, \\(\\ast\\).\n\\[\nr_1 = k_{6,f} \\theta_{CO_2}^{-\\nu_{CO_2\\!-\\!\\ast,6}} - k_{6,r} \\left[ CO_2 \\right]^{\\nu_{CO_2,6}} \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}^{\\nu_{\\ast,6}}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_{6,f} \\theta_{CO_2}^{-(-1)} - k_{6,r} \\left[ CO_2 \\right]^1 \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}^1\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_{6,f} \\theta_{CO_2} - k_{6,r} \\left[ CO_2 \\right] \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAssuming the other steps, reactions (2) through (5), to be at quasi-equilibrium gives equations (8) through (11).\n\\[\nK_2 = \\frac{\\theta_{O_2}}{ \\left[ O_2 \\right] \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_3 = \\frac{\\theta_{CO_3}}{ \\left[ CO \\right] \\theta_{O_2}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_4 = \\frac{ \\left[ CO_2 \\right] \\theta_{O}}{ \\theta_{CO_3}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_5 = \\frac{\\theta_{CO_2}}{ \\left[ CO \\right] \\theta_O} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 5.16.\n\\[\nK_{nrd} = \\prod_i \\left[i\\right]^{\\nu_{i,nrd}}\n\\]\nIn the case of step (2), \\(nrd=2\\), \\(i\\) indexes every species in the system, and when \\(i\\) is a surface species, \\([i] = \\theta_i\\).\n\\[\nK_2 = \\left[ CO \\right]^{\\nu_{CO,2}} \\left[ O_2 \\right]^{\\nu_{O_2,2}} \\left[ CO_2 \\right]^{\\nu_{CO_2,2}} \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}^{\\nu_{\\ast ,2}} \\theta_{O_2}^{\\nu_{O_2\\!-\\!\\ast ,2}} \\theta_{CO_3}^{\\nu_{CO_3\\!-\\!\\ast ,2}} \\theta_{O}^{\\nu_{O\\!-\\!\\ast ,2}} \\theta_{CO_2}^{\\nu_{CO_2\\!-\\!\\ast ,2}}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_2 = \\left[ CO \\right]^0 \\left[ O_2 \\right]^{-1} \\left[ CO_2 \\right]^0 \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}^{-1} \\theta_{O_2}^{1} \\theta_{CO_3}^0 \\theta_{O}^0 \\theta_{CO_2}^0\n\\]\n\\[\nK_2 = \\left[ O_2 \\right]^{-1} \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}^{-1} \\theta_{O_2}^{1} = \\frac{\\theta_{O_2}}{ \\left[ O_2 \\right] \\theta_{\\text{vacant}}}\n\\]\nThe equations for steps (3), (4), and (5) are generated analogously.\n\n\n\nRequiring the conservation of catalyst sites yields equation (12).\n\\[\n1 = \\theta_{\\text{vacant}} + \\theta_{O_2} + \\theta_{CO_3} + \\theta_O + \\theta_{CO_2} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 5.22.\n\\[\n1 = \\theta_{\\text{vacant}} + \\sum_k \\theta_k\n\\]\nThe index \\(k\\) includes the four adsorbed species: \\(O_2\\!-\\!\\ast\\), \\(CO_3\\!-\\!\\ast\\), \\(O\\!-\\!\\ast\\), and \\(CO_2\\!-\\!\\ast\\)\n\\[\n1 = \\theta_{\\text{vacant}} + \\theta_{O_2} + \\theta_{CO_3} + \\theta_O + \\theta_{CO_2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe five equations, (8) through (12), can be solved to obtain expressions the five surface coverages, \\(\\theta_{\\text{vacant}}\\), \\(\\theta_{O_2}\\), \\(\\theta_{CO_3}\\), \\(\\theta_O\\), and \\(\\theta_{CO_2}\\).

When all of the negligible terms are set equal to zero, equation (22) simplifies to equation (27).\n\\[\nr_1 = \\frac{k_{6,f}K_2K_3K_4K_5\\left[ CO \\right]^2 \\left[ O_2 \\right] - k_{6,r} \\left[ CO_2 \\right]^2}{K_2K_3K_4 \\left[ CO \\right] \\left[O_2 \\right]} \\tag{27}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nAs often occurs in mechanistic rate expressions, several of the rate coefficients and equilibrium constants in the rate expression, equation (27), are coupled.

Specifically, batch stirred-tank reactors (BSTRs), semi-batch stirred-tank reactors (SBSTRs), continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs) were introduced. The modeling of each of these will be discussed in detail later in this chapter. To begin, however, a generic reactor (one that could be any one of those four ideal reactor types) is considered.

    "text": "6.1.1 Variables Used When Modeling a Reactor\nBriefly, every ideal reactor has a compartment that contains reacting fluid. The reacting fluid in most reactors needs to be heated or cooled. There are many ways to do that, but as discussed in Appendix E, only one form of heat exchange is considered in Reaction Engineering Basics. If the reacting fluid needs to be heated or cooled, the reactor will have a second compartment. Depending on the specific physical structure of the reactor, the second compartment is sometimes referred to as the reactor shell or jacket, and a fluid will be flowing through it. That fluid is called the exchange fluid because its purpose is to exchange heat with the reacting fluid. The exchange fluid is physically separated from the reacting fluid by a solid wall that prevents the two fluids from mixing. Heat is transferred through the wall separating the two reactor compartments.\nNote that the word “reactor” sometimes refers to the entire piece of equipment including both the compartment containing the reacting fluid and the shell. Other times “reactor” refers only to the compartment containing the reacting fluid. This is not likely to cause confusion; the meaning is usually clear from the context of the statement. The physico-chemical properties of the reacting fluid and the exchange fluid, that is their densities, heat capacities, etc., are needed when modeling a reactor. Consequently, fluid properties are one of the groups of variables that appear in the equations used to model a reactor.\nReactor input and reactor output were defined above as what goes into the reactor and what comes out of the reactor. These definitions work fine for the continuous flow reactors (CSTRs and PFRs) because they have fluid flowing into and out of them as they operate. It also works for the exchange fluid, if present, because it, too, is flowing into and out of the reactor as the reactor operates. However, for BSTRs and SBSTRs the meaning of reactor input and reactor output requires additional refinement. For BSTRs the reactor input refers to what is present within the reaction compartment just before the reactions begin, and BSTR output refers to what is present within the reaction compartment right after the reactions end. The same meanings for input and output apply to SBSTRs, but SBSTR input additionally includes fluid that flows into the reaction compartment while the reactions are taking place. Reaction Engineering Basics does not consider SBSTRs where reacting fluid flows out of the reactor while reactions are occurring.\nThe reactor input variables are related to the fluid present within the reactor just before reaction begins and/or the fluid flowing into the reactor as the reaction is occurring. They include the molar amount (or molar flow rate) of every reagent, the temperature, and the pressure of that fluid. In addition, the reactor input variables include the mass flow rate of the exchange fluid, and the inlet temperature of the exchange fluid.\nThe output molar amount (or molar flow rates) of every reagent, output temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, and the rate at which work is done by the reacting system on its surroundings make up the reactor output variables. There are two differences when compared to the reactor input variables. First, Reaction Engineering Basics assumes there is never accumulation of exchange fluid within the reactor. Consequently the outlet mass flow rate of the exchange fluid is always equal to its inlet mass flow rate. Since the exchange fluid mass flow rate is included among the reactor input variables, it is not included among the reactor output variables.\nThe other difference is work done by the reacting system on its surroundings. If the reactor has a moving boundary, such as a pistion, it is possible for the reactor to perform mechanical work on its surroundings. That work is included among the reactor output variables. This is important, for example, if the combustion chamber in an automobile engine is modeled as a chemical reactor. The reactors considered in Reaction Engineering Basics are typically vessels located in a chemical processing facility or laboratory. The only moving boundaries associated with those reactors is usually a shaft connected to an agitator that is used to mix the reagents. In all cases in Reaction Engineering Basics, the work associated with agitation of the fluid in a stirred tank is considered to be negligible.\nReactor/process parameters appear in the reactor model equations. They include the dimensions of the reactor (volume for stirred tanks or diameter and length for PFRs), the shell volume, the heat transfer area, the heat transfer coefficient, and some measure of the reaction time. If there is a packed bed of catalyst particles in the reactor, the bed porosity is also included with these parameters.\nThe reaction time can be characterized in different ways. For closed systems (BSTRs and SBSTRs) the reaction time variable is measured using clock time. It is the difference between the clock time when the reaction started and the clock time when it ended. It is customary to define an elapsed time, \\(t\\), as being equal to zero when the reaction starts, in which case the reaction time is equal to the elapsed time when the reaction stops.\nIn an open system (CSTRs and PFRs), reaction starts when the fliud enters the reactor and it ends when the fluid leaves the reactor. The reaction time then is equal to the amount of time the fluid spends in the reactor. On average, a fluid flowing into a reactor of volume, \\(V\\), at a volumetric flow rate of \\(\\dot V_{in}\\), is within the reactor for an amount of time, \\(\\tau\\), given by Equation 6.1. In reaction engineering, \\(\\tau\\) is given a special name; it is called the space time. The reciprocal of \\(\\tau\\) is called the space velocity. For open, steady-state systems the space time can be used as a measure of the reaction time.\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{V}{\\dot V_{in}}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nThe elapsed time and the space time are explicit specifications of the reaction time. In some cases, the reaction time may be specified implicitly. For example, when a problem specifies the final amount of a reagent, that is an implicit specification of the reaction time. It means that the reaction proceeded for the length of time necessary for the amount of that reagent to change from its initial value to the specified final value.\nFinally, reaction properties include kinetics parameters and heats of reaction that appear in models of chemical reactors. Both fluid properties and reaction properties may vary as a function of temperature, pressure or composition. In those cases, equations for calculating the property must be available, and any constants that appear in those equations are included among the reaction and fluid properties. Table 6.1 summarizes the variable groups that are used when modeling an ideal reactor.\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Variable Groups Used to Model an Ideal Reactor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nVariables\n\n\n\n\nReactor Input\nInput molar amounts (or molar flow rates) of every reagent present in the system, input temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, mass flow rate of the exchange fluid (if there is one), and inlet temperature of the exchange fluid, if there is one.\n\n\nReactor Output\nOutput molar amounts (or molar flow rates) of every reagent present in the system, output temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, rate at which the reactor does mechanical work on its surroundings, and outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, if there is one.\n\n\nReactor/Process Parameters\nReactor dimensions (typically volume or diameter and length), shell/jacket volume, heat transfer area, heat transfer coefficient, packed bed porosity, and some measure of reaction time.\n\n\nFluid Properties\nHeat capacity of the reacting fluid or heat capacities of each reagent present in the system, heat capacity of the exchange fluid, reacting fluid density, exchange fluid density, reacting fluid viscosity.\n\n\nReaction Properties\nKinetics parameters for rate expressions, heat of reaction data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Equations for Modeling a Reactor\nThe groups of variables that are needed to describe an ideal reactor were identified above. The purpose of an ideal reactor model is to relate the reactor outputs to the reactor inputs. Mole balances relate the input molar amounts to the output molar amounts, so they are always included in a reactor model. A mole balance can be written for each reagent in the system, whether or not it is present in the reactor input. That includes reagents that are reactants or products in the reactions that are occurring as well as reagents that are neither reactants nor products in any of the reactions. The reagents that do not participate in any of the reactions can be referred to as “inerts.”\nEnergy balances on the reacting fluid and on the exchange fluid relate their output temperatures to the input variables. An energy balance on the reacting fluid also relates the rate at which the reactor performs work to the input variables. The reacting fluid and exchange fluid energy balances also are normally included in the reactor model equations. As discussed below, there are circumstances where a reactor can be modeled without using one or both of the energy balances.\nA momentum balance must sometimes be included in a reactor model for a PFR. When it is included, the momentum balance relates the outlet pressure of the reacting fluid to the reactor inputs. Momentum balances are not needed with any of the stirred tank reactors. The momentum balance accounts for the conversion of kinetic energy associated with the flow of the reacting fluid to thermal energy. While this energy is negligible with respect to the energy balance, it can have a significant effect upon the pressure of the reacting fluid as it flows through a PFR. For the stirred tank reactors, and for a PFR where the momentum balance is not needed, the outlet pressure can be calculated from the other output variables using the equation of state (i. e. using the ideal gas law or assuming liquids to have constant density).\nCollectively, the mole balances, energy balances, and momentum balance (when needed) are commonly referred to as the design equations for the reactor. The words “transient” and “steady state” are used to differentiate two modes of reactor operation. When a reactor operates at steady state, one can watch any one point in the reactor and the conditions (temperature, pressure, composition, flow rate, etc.) will not change over time. At a different point in the reactor, the conditions may be different, but they, too, will be constant over time. Putting it another way, when a reactor operates at steady state, the conditions may vary spatially, but they won’t vary temporally (i. e. over time). In a transient reactor one will observe changes in the conditions over time when watching any one point within the reactor. That is, within a transient reactor the conditions will vary temporally (and possibly spatially, too). Note that BSTRs and SBSTRs are always transient while CSTRs and PFRs can operate in either steady state or transient modes. The most general form of the design equations are those for transient operation. As described in subsequent sections, the design equations for steady-state operation represent a simplification of the transient design equations.\nIn addition to the reactor design equations rate expressions for every reaction taking place it the system are always needed when modeling a reactor. Assuming Arrhenius temperature dependence, the associated pre-exponential factors and activation energies, along with any other parameters appearing in the rate epxressions, are included among the reaction properties in Table 6.1. As noted above, physico-chemical properties that appear in the design equations may be functions of temperature, pressure, and/or composition. If so, equations for calculating them are needed, and any parameters appearing in them are included among the fluid properties in Table 6.1.\nTable 6.2 summarizes the equations used to model a generic ideal reactor.\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Modeling Equations for a Generic Ideal Reactor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquations\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on reagents present in the system, energy balance on the reacting fluid, energy balance on the exchange fluid, momentum balance (PFRs), and a differential form of the ideal gas law, as needed.\n\n\nRate Expressions\nEquations for calculating the rate of each reaction taking place within the system.\n\n\nOther Equations\nEquations for calculating heat capacities, heats of reaction, density, viscosity, etc., as needed.",

    "section": "6.2 Determining Which of the Reactor Design Equations are Needed",
    "text": "6.2 Determining Which of the Reactor Design Equations are Needed\nIt is not always necessary to use all of the reactor modeling equations listed in Table 6.2. For example, in closed and steady-state systems, mole balances do not need to be written for every reagent in the system because the amounts of the reactants and products in the reactions are related through stoichiometry. The amount of an inert reagent is not related to the amount of any other reagent through stoichiometry. If \\(N_{ind}\\) is the number of mathematically independent reactions taking place in the system, then \\(N_{ind}\\) mole balances are needed to relate the input amounts of reactants and products to the output amounts. Consequently, the minimum number of mole balances is equal to \\(N_{ind}\\) plus one mole balance for each inert reagent. Example 6.8.1 provides an example of this.\nLiquid-phase systems often consist of a solvent that contains the reagents as solutes. In systems of this type, sensible heat terms are usually written in terms of the mass-specific or volume-specific heat capacity of the entire reacting fluid. Generally, a mole balance on the liquid-phase solvent is not needed for such systems. If, for some reason, the sensible heat terms are written in terms of molar heat capacities of the individual reagents, then the solvent must be included among those reagents and a mole balance on the solvent would need to be included among the reactor design equations. Example 6.8.4 illustrates a system involving a liquid-phase solution.\nA momentum balance is only needed when the reactor is a PFR. Even then, some PFR problems indicate that pressure drop is negligible, in which case the momentum balance is not needed.\nIf a reactor operates adiabatically there will not be an exchange fluid, and consequently an energy balance on the exchange fluid cannot be included among the design equations. Example 6.8.2 illustrates the formulation of a reactor model for an adiabatic reactor. For historical reasons it is worth noting that for adiabatic systems, the energy balance on the reacting fluid can be replaced by an equation for the adiabatic temperature (see Appendix D and particularly Equation D.4). Before computers became commonplace, doing this sometimes made it easier to solve the design equations analytically. It isn’t as important now that powerful personal computers that can solve multiple ODEs are ubiquitous.\nIf a reactor operates isothermally, the mole balance equations and the energy balance equations are not coupled. The mole balance equations can be solved separately from the two energy balance equations. True isothermal operation of an industrial reactor is not very common, but laboratory reactors that are used to generate kinetics data normally operate isothermally. The energy balances may needed when modeling isothermal reactors, but if the reacting fluid temperature is known, the mole balances can be solved separately from the energy balances, and vice versa. Example 6.8.1 illustrates writing reactor design equations for an isothermal reactor.\nIf the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid is known and constant, the other reactor design equations can be solved independently from the energy balance on the exchange fluid. There are two situations where this can happen. The first is when the exchange fluid undergoes a phase change and exchanges the associated latent heat. Phase changes occur at constant temperature, so, for example, if condensation of saturated steam at 1 atm is being used to supply heat to the reacting fluid, the temperature of the exchange fluid will be constant and equal to 100 °C. Knowing this, all the other reactor design equations can be solved separately from the energy balance on the exchange fluid. In this case, the energy balance on the exchange fluid can be solved separately, for example, to calculate the minimum exchange fluid flow rate needed to provide the required amount of energy to the reacting fluid. Example 6.8.4 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for a system where the exchange fluid phase changes.\nThe other situation where all the other reactor design equations can be solved separately from the energy balance on the exchange fluid occurs in problems from reaction engineering courses or books. It is not uncommon for a problem to provide only the temperature of the exchange fluid, but not its flow rate or its inlet temperature. In this case the other design equations can be solved independently from the energy balance on the exchange fluid, while the energy balance on the exchange fluid cannot be used because the problem does not provide sufficient information to use it.\nThe differential form of the ideal gas law is included among the reactor design equations in Table 6.2. In some cases where the mole and energy balances for a stirred tank reactor are ODEs, there can be one more dependent variables than the number of ODEs. In this situation, the differential form of the ideal gas law is included among the reactor design equations, as indicated in the sections on each of the ideal stirred-tank reactors that follow.",

    "section": "6.3 Exchange Fluid Energy Balance",
    "text": "6.3 Exchange Fluid Energy Balance\nAn energy balance on the exchange fluid is one of the design equations for every one of the non-adiabatic ideal reactors, so it is considered first here. Reaction Engineering Basics assumes that the exchange fluid continually flows through the shell/jacket, and that within the shell/jacket, it is perfectly mixed. The exchange fluid is further assumed to be a pure fluid that either undergoes phase change or temperature change, but not both. The associated latent or sensible heat is transferred to or from the reacting fluid through a common wall that separates them.\nAs discussed in Appendix E, there are two forms of the energy balance on the exchange fluid: one is used when the temperature of exchange fluid changes, and the other is used when the exchange fluid changes phase. Examples 6.8.3 and 6.8.5 illustrate sensible heat is exchanged, i. e. exchange fluid temperature changes, and Example 6.8.4 illustrates a system where latent heat is exchanged, i. e. the exchange fluid undergoes a phase change.\n\n6.3.1 Exchange of Sensible Heat\nWhen the exchange fluid undergoes only temperature change, the energy balance on the exchange fluid is given by Equation E.1, which is reproduced here as Equation 6.2. The term on the left side of the equation represents the accumulation of sensible heat within the reactor shell/jacket. The first term on the right side of the equation represents the rate at which heat is transferred from the exchange fluid to the reacting fluid. The last term represents the change in the sensible heat of the exchange fluid as it first enters the shell/jacket and is immediately heated or cooled to the temperature of the exchange fluid within the shell/jacket. The immediate temperature change is a result of perfect mixing within the shell/jacket.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nIn Equation 6.2 the sensible heat terms are written in terms of the mass-specific heat capacity of the exchange fluid, \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\). It has units of energy per mass of exchange fluid per degree of temperature change. The sensible heat terms could also be written in terms of either the volume specific heat capacity (energy per volume of exchange fluid per degree of temperature change) or the molar heat capacity (energy per mole of exchange fluid per degree of temperature change). Equation 6.3 shows the three equivalent ways of writing the accumulation term and Equation 6.4 shows the three equivalent ways of writing the term for the sensible heat change.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V_{ex} \\breve C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\hat C_{p,ex}}{M_{ex}}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\dot m_{ex}}{\\rho_{ex}} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\breve C_{p,ex}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\dot m_{ex}}{M_{ex}} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\hat C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nIf the reactor operates at steady-state, the time derivative is equal to zero and the energy balance on the exchange fluid reduces to the form shown in Equation 6.5. As above, the term in Equation 6.5 representing the sensible heat change can be written using any of the equivalent forms shown in Equation 6.4.\n\\[\n0 = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\n\n\n6.3.2 Exchange of Latent Heat\nWhen the exchange fluid undergoes only phase change, the energy balance on the exchange fluid is given by Equation E.2, which is reproduced here as Equation 6.6. The term on the left side of the equation represents the accumulation of latent heat within the reactor shell/jacket, the first term on the right side of the equation represents the rate at which heat is transferred from the exchange fluid to the reacting fluid, and the last term represents the change in the latent heat of the fraction of the exchange fluid that condenses or evaporates.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\tag{6.6}\\]\nIf the reactor operates at steady-state, the time derivative is equal to zero and the energy balance on the exchange fluid reduces to Equation 6.7.\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\tag{6.7}\\]",

    "text": "6.4 Ideal BSTR Design Equations\nFrom the perspective of the reacting fluid, a BSTR is a closed system. Reacting fluid neither enters nor leaves the reactor while it is operating. This is apparent in the schematic BSTR diagram, Figure 6.1. The reacting fluid is shown in blue in that figure, with no reacting fluid entering or leaving. If the reactor has a one, the shell/jacket is an open system; heat exchange fluid continually flows through it. Figure 6.1 depicts a BSTR with a shell/jacket; the exchange fluid within it is shown in yellow. The two agitators in the figure are reminders that the reacting fluid within the reaction compartment and the exchange fluid within the shell are each perfectly mixed. An adiabatic BSTR would not have a shell/jacket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Schematic Representation of a Batch Stirred Tank Reactor\n\n\n\nThe most important assumptions when modeling an ideal BSTR are (i) the reaction zone is a closed system, (ii) within the reactor, the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iii) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, (iv) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture and (v) the reacting fluid does not undergo a phase change while the reactor is operating. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix H. Examples 6.8.1 and 6.8.2 illustrate writing reactor design equations for BSTRs.\nThe mole balance on any one reagent, \\(i\\), in an ideal BSTR is presented in Equation 6.8. It has only two terms: the term on the left side of the equation represents the rate of accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) and the term on the right side represents its net rate of generation. The summation in the generation term includes all reactions occurring in the system.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.8}\\]\nThe energy balance on the reacting fluid within an ideal BSTR is presented in Equation 6.9. The summation on the left side of the equation includes all reagents present in the system, not just reactants and products of the reactions. Similarly, the summation of the right side of the equation includes all reactions taking place in the system.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\frac{dV}{dt}  = \\dot Q - \\dot W - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\tag{6.9}\\]\nThe first term on the left side of Equation 6.9 represents the rate of accumulation of energy in the form of sensible heat. It is written in terms of the molar heat capacities of all of the reagents present in the system. That is probably the most common form of this term for a gas-phase reacting fluid. For liquid-phase reacting fluids, the sensible heat accumulation term is often expressed in terms of the mass-specific heat capacity of the fluid as a whole or the volume-specific heat capacity of the entire fluid. Equation 6.10 shows the three equivalent ways of writing the sensible heat accumulation term.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\tag{6.10}\\]\nThe second and third terms on the left side of Equation 6.9 represent accumulation of energy associated with work done during expansion or contraction of the reacting fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is likely that the second and third terms in Equation 6.9 will have units of pressure times volume per time while the other terms will have units of energy per time. It is critical to remember to convert all terms to consistent units. An easy way to do this is to multiply the second and third terms by the ratio of the ideal gas constant in energy units, \\(R_e\\), to the ideal gas constant in pressure-volume units, \\(R_w\\).\n\\[\n- V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\frac{dV}{dt} \\Rightarrow -\\frac{R_e}{R_w} \\left( V\\frac{dP}{dt}  + P  \\frac{dV}{dt} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nOn the right side of Equation 6.9, \\(\\dot Q\\) represents the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid. This term is the rate at which heat passes from the yellow exchange fluid in Figure 6.1 through the red internal wall and into the blue reacting fluid. If the exchange fluid is being used to heat the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot Q\\) is positive; if the exchange fluid is being used to cool the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot Q\\) is negative.\nIn Equation 6.9, \\(\\dot W\\) represents the rate at which the reacting fluid is doing mechanical work on the surroundings. In most cases, the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is work of the agitator as it mixes the reacting fluid. In this case, \\(\\dot W\\) is the agitator power delivered to the reacting fluid, and since it is added to the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot W\\) is negative. If the reacting fluid is able to expand and cause movement of a reactor wall, for example if it caused a piston to move, \\(\\dot W\\) would be positive and equal to the work needed to move the piston.\nThe final term in Equation 6.9 represents the energy associated with the reactions taking place within the reactor, i. e. the heats of reaction. As previously noted, the summation in this term includes all reactions taking place in the system.\nThe design equations for a BSTR are initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). In order to solve them, the number of dependent variables must equal the number of IVODEs. The differential form of the ideal gas law presented in Equation 6.11 is used when the number of dependent variables exceeds the number of IVODEs.\n\\[\nR_w \\left( T \\left( \\sum_i \\frac{dn_i}{dt} \\right) + \\left( \\sum_i n_i \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} \\right) -  P \\frac{dV}{dt} - V \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\n\\tag{6.11}\\]\n\n6.4.1 Common Simplifications of the BSTR Design Equations\nTypically, the walls of a BSTR are rigid. For gas-phase reacting fluids, when the reactor walls are rigid, the gas will always occupy the entire reactor volume and that volume will be constant. For liquid-phase reacting fluids, the reactor volume may not be completely full. If there is space above the top surface of the liquid, it is called headspace. In this situation, the volume appearing in the mole and energy balances is the volume of the liquid; it does not include the headspace. However, in Reaction Engineering Basics liquids are always assumed to be incompressible, ideal mixtures. Consequently, the volume is always constant for a liquid-phase reacting fluid, too. Thus, when the walls are rigid, the volume is constant for both gas-phase and liquid phase reacting fluids. In this case, the time derivative of the volume in the energy balance and in the differential form of the ideal gas law is equal to zero, Equation 6.12.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0\n\\tag{6.12}\\]\nIn all of the stirred tank models, the pressure change due to hydrostatic head is assumed to be negligible. That is, at all depths below the liquid surface the pressure is assumed to be the same. Because liquid-phase reacting fluids are assumed to be incompressible ideal mixtures, the pressure will be constant as the temperature and composition change. Since the pressure is constant, its time derivative will equal zero, equation Equation 6.13, for liquid-phase systems.\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\n\\tag{6.13}\\]\nAs already noted, it is often true that the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator. When compared to the magnitude of all of the other terms in the energy balance, this term is virtually always negligible, Equation 6.14. As an example, consider stirring a room temperature glass of water as vigourously as one is able to try to raise its temperature. One could stir as hard as possible and the temperature change would be very, very small.\n\\[\n\\dot W = 0\n\\tag{6.14}\\]\nIt has already been noted that if the reactor operates adiabatically, there will not be an exchange fluid in the reactor, so it is not possible to write an energy balance on it. By definition, in the energy balance for the reacting fluid, the rate of heat input is equal to zero for an adiabatic process, Equation 6.15.\n\\[\n\\dot Q = 0\n\\tag{6.15}\\]\n\n\n6.4.2 Ancillary Equations\nAs previously noted, the design equations for a BSTR are initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). As detailed in Appendix J, in order to solve a set of IVODEs, every quantity appearing in the IVODEs must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. The independent variable in the BSTR balance equations is time. Depending upon the specific reactor system, the dependent variables may include the molar amounts of the reagents, the temperature of the reacting fluid, the pressure of the reacting fluid, the volume of the reacting fluid, and the exchange fluid temperature.\nWhen rate expressions are substituted into the mole and energy balances, they will introduce concentrations or partial pressures (for gases), of some reagents. Those concentrations or partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the dependent variables in the IVODEs. This is accomplished using the defining equations for concentration and partial pressure, Equation 6.16 and Equation 6.17.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{n_i}{V}\n\\tag{6.16}\\]\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{n_iRT}{V}\n\\tag{6.17}\\]\nThe rate of heat transfer to the reacting fluid from the exchange fluid can be expressed in terms of the temperatures of those fluids using the overall heat transfer coefficient as shown in Equation 6.18.\n\\[\n\\dot Q = UA\\left( T_{ex} - T \\right)\n\\tag{6.18}\\]\nNote also that variable quantities appearing in any ancillary equation must also be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.",

    "section": "6.5 Ideal SBSTR Design Equations",
    "text": "6.5 Ideal SBSTR Design Equations\nThe only difference between an ideal BSTR and an ideal SBSTR is that fluid flows into or out of an ideal SBSTR. A very common situation where fluid flows in, is one where the reaction is higly exothermic, such as when neutralizing a strong acid using a strong base. If a BSTR was used, i. e. if all of the reactants were added at once, it would not be possible to control the temperature due to the very high initial rate of reaction and concommitant release of heat. By using an SBSTR where one of the reactants flows into the reactor, the temperature can be controlled by controlling the rate at which that reactant is added. This mode of SBSTR operation is sometimes called batch-fed or fed-batch operation. It is illustrated schematically in Figure 6.2. This is the only SBSTR operational mode that is considered in Reaction Engineering Basics. The other mode is one where no fluid enters the reactor, but fluid flows out. Most commonly this is done by operating at the boiling point of the reacting liquid, resulting in a two-phase system where the vaporized reagents flow out of the reactor. The presence of two phases in the reactor introduces additional complications that are typically considered in more advanced reaction engineering textbooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Schematic Representation of a Semi-Batch Stirred Tank Reactor\n\n\n\nThe most important assumptions when modeling an ideal SBSTR are (i) fluid flows into the reactor, but not out, (ii) the fluid does not change phase upon entering the reactor or within it (iii) within the reactor the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iv) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, and (v) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix H. Example 6.8.3 illustrates writing the reactor design equations for an ideal SBSTR.\nNot surprisingly, the mole and energy balances for an SBSTR are similar to those for a BSTR, but with additional terms associated with the fluid stream flowing into the reactor. The ideal SBSTR mole balance is shown in Equation 6.19. The first and last terms are the same as in the BSTR mole balance. The added term represents the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) into the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.19}\\]\nSimilarly, the ideal SBSTR energy balance, shown in Equation 6.20, has one additional term that is not found in the BSTR energy balance. The added term is the third term on the right side of Equation 6.20. It represents the heat required to raise or lower the entering fluid from its feed temperature to the temperature of the reacting fluid. Due to the assumption of perfect mixing, this temperature change occurs instantaneously as the fluid enters the reactor.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_i \\left( n_i \\hat C_{p,i}\\right) & \\frac{dT}{dt} -V\\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\ &- \\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT  - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{6.20}\\]\nAs in the BSTR energy balance, the two sensible heat terms in Equation 6.20 are written in terms of the molar heat capacities of the reagents in the system. This form is common for gas-phase systems, but for liquid-phase systems it is sometimes useful to express these sensible heats in terms of the mass-specific heat capacity of the reacting fluid or the volume-specific heat capacity of the fluid. Equation 6.10 shows the equivalent ways of writing the heat accumulation term. Equation 6.21 shows equivalent ways of writing the term for the sensible heat added to the feed fluid.\n\\[\n\\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\tilde C_pdT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\breve C_pdT\n\\tag{6.21}\\]\nThe differential form of the ideal gas law for an SBSTR is the same as that for a BSTR, Equation 6.11.\n\n6.5.1 Common Simplifications of the SBSTR Design Equations\nIt is important to understand that for each of the ideal reactor types, the mole and energy balances are written for the reacting fluid volume, not the physical volume of the reactor. Gas-phase reacting fluids expand to fill the physical volume of the reactor, so assuming the reactor walls are rigid, the reacting fluid volume will be constant and the time derivative of the reacting fluid volume will equal zero, Equation 6.12. However, for a liquid, the volume of the reacting fluid will increase as the feed enters the reactor. In other words, as liquid enters the SBSTR, the reacting fluid volume will increase and the headspace will decrease. If the reacting liquid is assumed to be an incompressible ideal mixture, and the feed flows in at a constant rate, the reacting fluid volume will then be given by Equation 6.22. The time derivative of the reacting fluid volume shown in equation Equation 6.23 applies even if the inlet feed rate is variable as long as the liquid is an incompressible ideal mixture.\n\\[\nV = V_0 + \\dot V_{in}t\n\\tag{6.22}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot V_{in}\n\\tag{6.23}\\]\nMany of the simplifications used for BSTRs are also used for SBSTRs. If the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator, the rate of doing work, \\(\\dot W\\), may be assumed to be negligible, Equation 6.14. If the reactor operates adiabatically, the heat input term, \\(\\dot Q\\), is equal to zero, Equation 6.15. Assuming the liquid to be an incompressible ideal mixture, the time derivative of the pressure, for liquids, is equal to zero, Equation 6.13.\n\n\n6.5.2 Ancillary Equations\nThe ancillary equations commonly used with batch reactors are also used with semi-batch reactors. Specifically, the defining equations for concentration and partial pressure, Equations 6.16 and 6.17, can be used to express those quantities in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. Similarly, the rate of heat transfer can be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables using Equation 6.18.",

    "section": "6.6 Ideal CSTR Design Equations",
    "text": "6.6 Ideal CSTR Design Equations\nAn ideal CSTR is similar to an ideal BSTR and an ideal SBSTR, with the primary difference being that fluid continuously flows in and out of a CSTR. This is represented schematically in Figure 6.3. Notice that because the reacting fluid within the reactor is perfectly mixed, the outlet temperature equals the temperature of the reacting fluid within the reactor. Similarly, the figure shows that the concentrations of the reagents leaving the reactor are the same as they are within the reactor. When writing the ideal CSTR mole and energy balance equations, the “out” is omitted from the subscript to simplify the notation. (The “in” is retained for the feed stream, however, to differentiate it from the outlet stream.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Schematic Representation of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor\n\n\n\nThe most important assumptions of the ideal CSTR model are (i) the reactor is an open system with fluid continually flowing in and out, (ii) within the reactor the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iii) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, (iv) no phase changes occur upon entering or within the reactor, and (v) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix H. Example 6.8.4 illustrates writing the reactor design equations for an ideal CSTR.\nA mole balance on reagent \\(i\\) in a CSTR is presented in Equation 6.24. In contrast to the BSTR and SBSTR balances, the CSTR mole and energy balances are written in terms of the molar flow rates of the reagents, \\(\\dot n_i\\), not the molar amounts, \\(n_i\\). The three terms on the left side of Equation 6.24 represent the accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) in the reacting fluid. The first term is accumulation due to a changing outlet molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\). The second term represents accumulation due to the volume of the reacting fluid changing and the third represents accumulation due to changes in the outlet volumetric flow rate. The first term on the right side of the equation is clearly the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) into the reactor and the second term on the right side is its molar flow out of the reactor. The last term represents the moles of reagent \\(i\\) that are generated by the reactions taking place within the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} + \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\\frac{dV}{dt} - \\frac{\\dot n_iV}{\\dot V^2}\\frac{d \\dot V}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.24}\\]\nThe energy balance on the reacting fluid within an ideal CSTR is presented in Equation 6.25. The terms in that equation have a one-to-one correspondence with the terms in the SBSTR energy balance, Equation 6.20, representing sensible heat accumulation, two components of the accumulation of energy associated with mechanical work done of expanding or contracting reacting fluid, the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid, the rate at which the reacting fluid does work on the surroundings, the heat required to raise or lower the entering fluid from its feed temperature to the temperature of the reacting fluid, and the energy associated with the reactions taking place within the reactor, respectively. The first term looks different because the ideal CSTR balances are written in terms of molar flow rates and not molar amounts.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) &\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\&- \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.25}\\]\nOnce again, the sensible heat terms in Equation 6.25 are written in terms of the molar heat capacities of the reagents in the system. Equation 6.26 shows equivalent ways of writing the first term in Equation 6.25, and Equation 6.21 shows equivalent ways of writing the next to last term in Equation 6.25.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\tag{6.26}\\]\nAs noted below, when the reacting fluid in a CSTR is a gas, both the volume and the pressure are constant, so a differential form of the ideal gas law is not needed.\n\n6.6.1 Common Simplifications of the CSTR Design Equations\nWhen the CSTR walls are rigid a gas-phase reacting fluid will always occupy the complete physical volume of the reactor. That means that the volume in the mole and energy balances will be constant and the time-derivative of the volume will equal zero, Equation 6.12. Very often this is also true for a liquid-phase reacting fluid. However, during transient operation, it is possible for the reacting liquid volume to increase or decrease, along with an equal but opposite change in the headspace. When the liquid is assumed to be an incompressibe, ideal mixture, this only happens if the inlet and outlet volumetric flow rates are not equal.\nIdeal CSTRs are almost always assumed to operate at constant pressure. As a consequence, the time derivative of the pressure is then equal to zero, Equation 6.13. Unlike BSTRs and SBSTRs where this was only true for liquid-phase reacting fluids, for CSTRs this is true for both liquid-phase and gas-phase reacting fluids.\nAs was true for the other stirred tank reactors, when the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator, the rate of work being done by the fluid may be assumed to be negligible, Equation 6.14. As for all reactors, if the reactor operates adiabatically, the rate of heat input is zero, Equation 6.15.\nFinally, continuous reactors like CSTRs can operate at steady state. In fact CSTRs are usually designed to operate at steady state. When a CSTR operates at steady state, all of the time derivatives are equal to zero. Steady-state operation is considered separately, below.\n\n\n6.6.2 Ancillary Equations\nWhen rate expressions are substituted into the CSTR design equations, they introduce concentrations or partial pressures. Before the design equations can be solved, the concentrations or partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the independent and dependent variables. This can be done using their defining equations for open systems, Equations 6.27 and 6.28. In these equations the molar flow rates and volumetric flow rates are the outlet values. The rate needs to be evaluated at the conditions within the reactor, but because a CSTR is perfectly mixed, the outlet concentration, partial pressure, and temperature are equal to the concentration, partial pressure, and temperature within the reactor.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\tag{6.27}\\]\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{ \\dot n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i \\dot n_i}P\n\\tag{6.28}\\]\nIt important to remember that the volumetric flow rate for gas phase systems can change. The ideal gas law, Equation 6.29, can be used to express the volumetric flow rate in terms of the dependent variables. Substitution of Equation 6.29 into Equation 6.27 yields the expression for gas phase concentration in Equation 6.30. The rate of heat transfer can be expressed in terms of a heat transfer coefficient as was done for the other stirred tank reactors, Equation 6.18. Equations also are needed for heat capacities, heats of reaction, kinetics parameters, etc. if they are not constant.\n\\[\n\\dot V = \\frac{\\displaystyle RT \\sum_i \\dot n_i}{P}\n\\tag{6.29}\\]\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i \\dot n_i}\\frac{P}{RT}\n\\tag{6.30}\\]\n\n\n6.6.3 Steady-State CSTR Design Equations\nIt was noted above that CSTRs are typically designed to operate at steady state, and when they do, all of the time derivatives in the balance equations are equal to zero. The resulting steady-state CSTR mole and energy balances are presented in Equation 6.31 and Equation 6.32.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.31}\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot Q - \\dot W - \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\tag{6.32}\\]\nWhen applicable, the common simplifications and ancillary equations identified above for transient CSTRs can also be used with steady-state CSTRs.",

    "section": "6.7 Ideal PFR Design Equations",
    "text": "6.7 Ideal PFR Design Equations\nThe ideal PFR is very different from the three ideal stirred tank reactor types. It is not perfectly mixed, but instead the reacting fluid flows steadily from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet. The reactor is assumed to be cylindrical with a constant diameter, and the reacting fluid is assumed to flow only in the axial direction. The velocity of the flow at any fixed axial position is constant across the full diameter of the tubular reactor. This is called plug flow, and is illustrated in Figure 6.4. If the walls of the reactor were transparent and it was possible to color a disk-shaped portion of the fluid as shown in that figure, the colored fluid would look like a solid disk moving from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: In plug flow, the aqua-colored fluid would appear to move from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor, retaining its disk shape the entire time.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the PFR model assumes that at any one axial position, the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial direction. As a consequence, there are no composition, temperature or pressure gradients in the radial direction. The composition, temperature, and pressure will change as a function of axial position. This is indicated by a gradient in the blue color representing the reacting fluid in the schematic representation, Figure 6.5. As that figure also shows, heat can be exchanged through the entire cylindrical wall of the reactor since the shell/jacket surrounds it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Schematic Representation of a Plug Flow Reactor\n\n\n\nThe most important assumptions of the ideal PFR model are (i) the reactor is cylindrical with a constant diameter, (ii) the reacting fluid is in plug flow, (iii) there is perfect mixing of the reacting flow in the radial direction and no mixing in the axial direction, (iv) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, and (v) no phase changes occur upon entering or within the reactor. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix H. Example 6.8.5 illustrates writing the reactor design equations for an ideal PFR.\nA mole balance on any one reagent, \\(i\\) in an ideal PFR is presented in Equation 6.33. The first term on the left side of the reactor represents the change in the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) along the length of the reactor. The second term represents the accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) at any point in the reactor due to change in its molar flow rate while the third term represents the accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) at any point due to change in the volumetric flow rate of the reacting fluid. The term on the right side of Equation 6.33 represents the generation of reagent \\(i\\) due to the reactions that are taking place within the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot n_i}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\frac{\\partial\\dot n_i}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\pi D^2\\dot n_i}{4\\dot V^2} \\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial t}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.33}\\]\nThe energy balance on the reacting fluid in an ideal PFR takes the form shown in Equation 6.34. The first term on the left side of the equation represents the change in sensible heat along the length of the reactor while the second term represents the accumulation of sensible heat at any one point in the reactor. The third term on the left side of Equation 6.34 represents the accumulation of energy corresponding to the work associated with flow at any point in the reactor. The first term on the right side of the equation represents the rate of heat transfer from the exchange fluid to the reacting fluid at any axial position in the reactor. The last term represents the heat associated with the occurrence of the reactions.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\left(\\sum_i \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} +& \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\sum_i \\left(\\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t} \\\\ &= \\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right) - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.34}\\]\nThe sensible heat terms in Equation 6.34 are expressed in terms of the molar heat capacities of the reagents. Equation 6.35 shows equivalent ways of expressing the term representing the change in sensible heat along the length of the reactor using the mass-specific heat capacity or the volume-specific heat capacity of the reacting fluid. Equation 6.36 does the same for the term representing the accumulation of sensible heat.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho \\dot V \\tilde C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\dot V \\breve C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\n\\tag{6.35}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\sum_i \\left(\\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\rho \\tilde C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\breve C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\n\\tag{6.36}\\]\nAnother difference between the ideal PFR and the ideal CSTR is the possibility of a drop in the pressure of the reacting fluid as it flows through the reactor. It was noted previously that pressure drop in a CSTR is usually assumed to be negligible. While that may be true for an ideal PFR, the friction between the fluid and the reactor walls and between the fluid and the particles making up a packed bed within the reactor can cause some of the kinetic energy associated with the flow to degrade into heat. The effect upon the energy balance is typically negligible, but this degradation of mechanical energy to heat also results in pressure drop. A momentum balance (also called a mechanical energy balance) is used to calculate the pressure drop. The momentum balance equation for an ideal PFR is shown in Equation 6.37.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{4 \\dot V}{\\pi D^2} \\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4 \\rho} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} = - \\frac{2 f \\dot V^2}{\\pi D^3}\n\\tag{6.37}\\]\nTransient PFRs are not analyzed in Reaction Engineering Basics, and for steady-state PFRs, a differential form of the ideal gas law is not needed.\n\n6.7.1 Common Simplifications of the PFR Design Equations\nIf an ideal PFR operates adiabatically, the heat transfer term is equal to zero as shown in Equation 6.38.\n\\[\n\\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right) = 0\n\\tag{6.38}\\]\nLike CSTRs, PFRs typically are designed to operate at steady state. In the mole, energy, and momentum balance equations for an ideal steady-state PFR, all of the time derivatives are equal to zero. Steady-state operation is considered separately below.\n\n\n6.7.2 Ancillary Equations\nThe most common ancillary equations used when modeling an ideal PFR are the same as those used with CSTRs. Concentrations and partial pressures introduced in rate expressions can be written in terms of the dependent variables in the balance equations using Equations 6.27 and 6.28. As with the CSTR, it is important to remember that the volumetric flow rate of a gas-phase reacting system can change. Equation 6.29 is again used to express the volumetric flow rate of a gas-phase system in terms of the molar flow rates, temperature, and pressure. Ancillary equations for heat capacities, heats of reaction, kinetics parameters, etc. are also needed if these quantities cannot be assumed to be constant.\n\n\n6.7.3 Steady-State PFR Design Equations\nThe mole and energy balance equations for modeling an ideal, steady-state PFR are generated by setting all of the time derivatives in Equations 6.33 and 6.34 equal to zero. The resulting steady-state PFR mole balance is shown in Equation 6.39, and the resulting energy balance is shown in Equation 6.40. Notice that because none of the variables depend upon time when operating at steady state, the partial derivatives with respect to \\(z\\) become ordinary derivatives.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.39}\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{d T}{d z} = \\pi D U\\left( T_e - T  \\right) - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\tag{6.40}\\]\nIn some situations the pressure drop in an ideal PFR can be negligible. In that case, a momentum balance is not used when modeling the reactor. If the pressure drop is not negligible, or if it isn’t known whether the pressure drop is significant, a momentum balance is used. The steady-state, ideal PFR momentum balance can take one of two forms. If the reacting fluid is the only thing in the reactor, the steady-state momentum balance shown in Equation 6.41 is used. If the reactor contains solid particles in the form of a packed bed, the steady-state momentum balance shown in Equation 6.42 is used instead. The latter equation is called the Ergun equation, named after Sabri Ergun who first derived it (Ergun 1952).\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = - \\frac{4G}{\\pi D^2} \\frac{d \\dot V}{dz} - \\frac{fG^2}{2D \\rho}\n\\tag{6.41}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{dP}}{{dz}} =  - \\frac{{1 - \\varepsilon }}{{{\\varepsilon ^3}}}\\frac{{{G^2}}}{{\\rho {\\Phi _s}{D_p}}}\\left[ {\\frac{{150\\left( {1 - \\varepsilon } \\right)\\mu }}{{{\\Phi _s}{D_p}G}} + 1.75} \\right]\n\\tag{6.42}\\]",

    "text": "6.8 Examples\nThe examples in this chapter illustrate choosing those design equations that are needed to model the reactors described in the example. In doing so, all summations and continuous products are expanded and any terms that are negligible or equal to zero are eliminated. Solving the design equations presented in these examples would require additional ancillary equations. When the design equations are IVODEs, initial values and a stopping criterion would also be needed. The specification of initial values and a stopping criterion, the generation of the necessary ancillary equations, and the solution of the design equations will be described and discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\n6.8.1 Modeling an Isothermal BSTR using the Minimum Number of Mole Balances\nGas phase reaction (1) occurs isothermally at a known temperature in an ideal BSTR. Initially the reactor contains only known molar amounts of A, B, and an inert gas, I. Write the minimum number of reactor design equations needed to model the composition within this system over time.\n\\[\nA + 2 B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nMole balances are always needed when modeling a reactor. Here the minimum number of design equations are to be used. There is one reaction taking place and there is an inert present in the system, so the minimum number of mole balances is two. A mole balance on the inert is required. The other mole balance can be for A, B, Y, or Z. Choosing to write the second mole balance on reagent A results in equations (2) and (3).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_I}{dt} = 0 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -r_1V \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.8. There is only one reaction, \\(j\\), so the sum becomes a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dn_i}{dt} =  \\nu_{i,1}r_1V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficient of reagent I is zero, leading to a trivial mole balance that can be solved analytically.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_I}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_I = \\text{constant} = n_{I,0}\n\\]\nIn the case of reagent A, its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction (1) is -1, which can be substituted into the general mole balance.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \\nu_{A,1}r_1V = -r_1V\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe reactor operates isothermally, and its temperature is known. Consequently the mole balance equations above can be solved independently of any other reactor design equations. Here the equations are needed to model the only the composition of the system, so equations (2) and (3) are the only reactor design equations needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving the design equations above will yield the molar amounts of A and I over time. The amounts of the other reagents can be calculated using the stoichiometry of the reaction and the initial amounts of the reagents, Equation 3.11. (It also may be necessary to use this relationship to solve the design equations.)\nIt should also be noted that energy balances were not needed here because the problem specifically stated that the composition of the reactor over time was to be modeled. For an isothermal system where the temperature is known, the mole balances can be solved independently of the energy balances. An alternative assignment might have provided additional information and asked for the coolant flow rate as a function of time that would be necessary to operate the reactor isothermally. For that assignment energy balances on the reacting and exchange fluids would be needed, even though the mole balances still could be solved independently of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.2 Modeling an Adiabatic BSTR\nGas-phase reaction (1) takes place in an ideal, adiabatic BSTR. Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike the previous example, this example does not stipulate that the minimum number of design equations be used. Using the minimum number of design equations is important if they are going to be solved analytically. Nonetheless, even if the minimum number of design equations is used, they often cannot be solved analytically, making a numerical solution necessary. I prefer to I prefer to include a mole balance for every reagent present in the system and solve the equations numerically. Here the only reagents are A and Z, so Equation 6.8 will be written for each of them. There is only one reaction taking place, so the summation in Equation 6.8 becomes a single term, and the stoichiometric coefficients of A and Z are -1 and 1, respectively.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on reagents A and Z are shown in equations (2) and (3), respectively. An energy balance on the reacting fluid is presented in equation (4). The reactor is adiabatic, so there isn’t an exchange fluid to write an energy balance for, and momentum balances are not used with stirred tank reactors.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = - r_1 V \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} =  r_1 V \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left( n_A \\hat C_{p,A} + n_Z \\hat C_{p,Z} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt} = - V r_1 \\Delta H_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.9 \\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\frac{dV}{dt}  = \\dot Q - \\dot W - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\]\nThere are two reagents in the system, A and Z, so the first summation expands to two terms. There is only one reaction occurring, so the last summation reduces to a single term. The volume of a BSTR is constant, so the time derivative of the volume is equal to zero. The reactor is adiabatic, so \\(\\dot Q\\) is equal to zero, and the reacting fluid does no work, so \\(\\dot W\\) is equal to zero (assuming the power associated with agitation is negligible).\n\\[\n\\left( n_A \\hat C_{p,A} + n_Z \\hat C_{p,Z} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} -V r_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nThe pressure in this system is not constant because the temperature will change as the reaction proceeds, and for an ideal gas at constant volume, the pressure will change as the temperature changes.\n\n\n\nAt present there are 3 reactor design equations, but they contain 4 dependent variables (\\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(T\\), and \\(P\\)). As noted in Appendix J, the number of IVODEs must equal the number of dependent variables, so as described in Section 6.4, the differential version of the ideal gas law, Equation 6.11, is added to the design equations, setting the time derivative of the volume equal to zero.\n\\[\nR_w \\left( T \\left( \\sum_i \\frac{dn_i}{dt} \\right) + \\left( \\sum_i n_i \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} \\right) - V \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the volume was assumed to be constant when writing both the energy balance and the differential form of the ideal gas law. In chemical processing equipment there are almost never moving reactor walls. As a consequence, when the reacting fluid is an ideal gas or an ideal liquid solution, the reactor volume of a BSTR can always be assumed to be fixed, meaning its time derivative may always be assumed to be zero. In Reaction Engineering Basics, the assignment would explicitly say so if this was not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.3 Modeling a Cooled SBSTR\nThe exothermic, liquid-phase acid neutralization, reaction (1), occurs in an ideal SBSTR. Initially a known volume of a solution containing only reagent B is present in the reactor. To start the process a different solution containing only A begins flowing into the reactor. The pressure within the reactor is constant. Chilled water flows into the reactor jacket at a constant flow rate. Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system. Assume that the volumetric heat capacity of the reacting fluid and the gravimetric heat capacity of the exchange fluid are known.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow S + W \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations always include mole balances. I will write a mole balance one each of the reagents, A, B, S, and W. The reactor is neither isothermal nor adiabatic, so energy balances on the reacting fluid and on the exchange fluid must also be included among the design equations. A momentum balance is not included because momentum balances are not used with stirred tank reactors.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on A, B, S, and W take the form shown in equations (2) through (5).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \\dot n_{A,in} - r_1V \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = - r_1V \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_S}{dt} = r_1V \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_W}{dt} = r_1V \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.19. \\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nThere is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term for that reaction.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + r_1V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficient of A is -1, leading to equation (2). The inlet stream contains only A, so the inlet molar flow rates of B, S, and W are equal to zero. The stoichiometric coefficients of B, S, and W are -1, 1 and 1, respectively. Substitution of those values yields equations (3), (4), and (5).\n\n\n\nEquation (6) is an energy balance on the reacting fluid.\n\\[\n\\breve C_pV \\frac{dT}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot V_{in} \\breve C_p \\left( T - T_{in} \\right)  - r_1  \\Delta H_1 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.20 with the sensible heat terms written in terms of the known volume-specific heat capacity of the reacting fluid.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\breve C_pV & \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\ &- \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\breve C_pdT  - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe pressure is constant, so its derivative with respect to time is equal to zero. The only work being done is that associated with agitating the liquid, and that may be assumed to be negligible. The heat capacity is constant, so it can be taken outside of the integral and the integral can be evaluated. Again, there is only one reaction occurring, so the summation in the last term reduces to a single term for that reaction.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\breve C_pV & \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dP}{dt}} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} \\\\ &- \\dot V_{in} \\breve C_p \\left( T - T_{in} \\right)  - r_1 V \\Delta H_1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nApplying those simplifications results in equation (6).\n\n\n\nThe exchange fluid is removing energy in the form of sensible heat, so an energy balance on that fluid is given by equation (7).\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex} \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right) \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.2. \\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\nNoting that the heat capacity is constant, it can be taken outside of the integral, and the integral can be evaluated, leading to equation (9).\n\n\n\nAt present there are 6 reactor design equations, but they contain 7 dependent variables (\\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(T\\), \\(V\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\)). The number of IVODEs must equal the number of dependent variables, so another IVODE is needed. This is a liquid-phase system, so the differential form of the ideal gas law does not apply. However, if the liquid is assumed to be an ideal mixture, the rate of change of the reacting fluid volume will equal the inlet volumetric flow rate of the feed stream, Equation 6.23. With the inclusion of equation (8) there are 7 IVODEs and 7 dependent variables.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot V_{in} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis problem indicates that the reactor initially contained a solution containing B and that the feed was a solution containing A. That implies that there is a solvent in the system, but a mole balance for the solvent was not written. This is quite common for liquid phase reacting fluids. It is possible because reaction does not change the amount of solvent and because the heat capacity of the reacting fluid as a whole was used in the energy balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.4 Modeling a Steady-State CSTR where the Exchange Fluid Phase Changes\nLiquid-phase reaction (1) takes place in an ideal steady-state CSTR. Saturated steam is fed to the reactor jacket at a constant rate and condenses within the jacket. Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system assuming that the gravimetric heat capacities of the reacting and exchange fluids are known and constant.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nMole balances are always included among the design equations, so mole balances for each of the three reagents, A, B, and Z, will be written. The reactor is being heated by the condensation of steam, so energy balances on the reacting fluid and the exchange fluid are also necessary.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nSteady-state mole balances on A, B, and Z are shown in equations (2), (3), and (4).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{A,in} - \\dot n_A - r_1 V \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{B,in} - \\dot n_B - r_1 V \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot n_Z = \\dot{n}_Z + r_1 V \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.24 \\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} + \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\\frac{dV}{dt} - \\frac{\\dot n_iV}{\\dot V^2}\\frac{d \\dot V}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nThis is a steady-state process, so all of the time derivatives are equal to zero. Additionally, only one reaction is taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term for that reaction.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + \\nu_{i,1}r_1 V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficients of A and B are -1 while that of Z is 1.Making these substitutions leads to equations (2) through (4).\n\n\n\nAn energy balance on the reacting fluid takes the form shown in equation (5).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot Q - \\rho \\dot V_{in} \\tilde C_p  \\left( T - T_{in} \\right) - r_1 V \\Delta H_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.25. \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) &\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\&- \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nAgain, the time derivatives are all equal to zero because the system operates at steady state.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot Q - \\dot W - \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\]\nThe only work performed in this process is that associated with agitating the reacting fluid. That work may be assumed to be negligible. The sensible heat term can be written in terms of the known mass-specific heat capacity. There is only one reaction occurring in the system, so the final summation reduces to a single term for that reaction.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot Q - \\rho \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - r_1 V \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nNoting that the heat capacity is constant, it can be taken outside the integral and the integral can be evaluated, leading to equation (5).\n\n\n\nAn energy balance on the steam in the jacket is given by Equation 6.6. Here the reactor operates at steady-state, so the time derivative is equal to zero, resulting in equation (6).\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that the temperature of the saturated steam is known, the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid, equations (2) through (5), can be solved independently of the energy balance on the exchange fluid, equation (6). In that situation, equation (6) can be used to calculate the mass flow rate of the steam, given the fraction of the steam that condenses, or the fraction of the steam that condenses, given the mass flow rate of the steam.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.5 Modeling a Steady-State PFR where the Exchange Fluid Temperature Changes\nThe gas-phase dimerization of A, reaction (1), and its degradation to Z, reaction (2), take place simultaneously in an ideal steady-state PFR. The reactor operates with negligible pressure drop. A liquid coolant flows into the reactor shell at a constant mass flow rate and known temperature, and leaves the shell as a liquid. Write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system.\n\\[\n2 A \\rightarrow A_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations always include mole balances, so mole balances will be written for A, A2, and Z. The reacting fluid is being heated or cooled using sensible heat from the exchange fluid, so energy balances are needed for the reacting fluid and the exchange fluid.

    "text": "7.1 Analytical vs. Numerical Solution of the Reactor Model Equations\nIn some scenarios the reactor model equations can be solved analytically. Most of these scenarios involve isothermal reactor operation with one reaction taking place and with a rate expression that is fairly simple. In a few instances the reactor can be adiabatic or there can be more than one reaction occurring.\nStill, the scenarios where the reactor model equations can be solved analytically do not include many important, real-world situations that involve adiabatic operation, multiple reactions, complex rate expressions, non-isothermal operation involving heat exchange, and others. In all of these scenarios the reactor model equations can be solved numerically. Of course in the scenarios where analytical solution is possible, the reactor design equations can also be solved numerically. Therefore, in Reaction Engineering Basics the reactor design equations are always solved numerically.\nChapter 6 showed that for ideal BSTRs, SBSTRs, CSTRs, and PFRs, the reactor models will be some combination of algebraic-transcendental equations and differential equations. Fortunately, there are many software packages that provide tools for numerical solution of the sets of equations that make up reactor models. However, from the perspective of a book like this, that presents two challenges.\nFirst, different readers of this book will want, or need, to use different software packages. If one software package is selected and used throughout, the book will be less useful to readers who do not use that software. At the same time, there are too many different software packages to try to show how to use all of them.\nA second challenge that arises from the decision to always solve the reactor model equations numerically is one of focus. This book is about reaction engineering, not computer programming or numerical methods. Including extended discussions on the computational aspects of solving the reactor model equations might obfuscate the reaction engineering.\nTo address these challenges, in Reaction Engineering Basics, all discussion of how software equation solvers work and how they are used appears in Appendices I, J, K, and M. The presentation in those appendices is general and not specific any one software package. Fortunately, all software solvers for a given type of equation (ATE, IVODE, etc.) require essentially same inputs and return essentially the same results. It is mainly the programming language used and the details of how to access the equation solving software, how to provide the inputs, and how the results are returned that differ from one software package to the next. Appendices I, J, K, and M provide some basic understanding of how the software solves the equations, with sufficient information for readers to follow Reaction Engineering Basics example assignments and to implement solutions using the software they prefer. It is left to the reader to consult the documentation for the software they choose to learn the details for using it.",

    "section": "7.2 Ideal Reactor Analysis",
    "text": "7.2 Ideal Reactor Analysis\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics, when an assignment involves analysis of an ideal reactor, the assignment is completed in four basic steps. These steps provide a good framework for readers to use when they perform ideal reactor analyses, as well.\n\nSummarize the information provided in the assignment.\nFormulate the solution mathematically.\nImplement the solution numerically.\nReport and comment upon the results.\n\n\n7.2.1 Summarizing the Information Provided in the Assignment\nIn a book like this, assignments take the form of a few paragraphs that provide data and then assign tasks or ask questions. (In practice, a reaction engineering assignment might define tasks that the engineer must do or questions the engineer must answer, but leave it to the engineer to find the necessary data.) A good way to start the analysis of an ideal reactor involves reading through the assignment.\nDuring the first reading of the assignment, each time a numeric value is encountered, an appropriate variable should be chosen to represent it, and it should be added to a list of given constants. Then the assignment should be read a second time to identify the type of reactor and details about how it is being operated, and this information should be written down. Finally, the assignment should be read a third time to identify all of the quantities of interest, that is, the things that need to be calculated in order to accomplish the assigned task or answer the questions posed in the assignment. In doing this, an appropriate variable should be chosen to represent each quantity of interest, and it should be added to a listing of the quantities of interest.\nThe result of this step is a concise summary of the assignment that provides (a) given constants, (b) the reactor being used and how it is being operated, and (c) the quantities of interest that need to be calculated. As this process becomes familiar, it may not be necessary to read the assignment three times to complete the assignment summary.\n\n\n7.2.2 Formulating the Solution Mathematically\nIn essence, “formulating the solution mathematically” means writing all of the equations that will be needed to complete the assignment and briefly describing how to use them. The formulation is written in anticipation of implementing the solution numerically. The mathematical formulation always begins by generating the reactor design equations need to model the reactor. Chapter 6 describes how to do this.\nIn most cases, additional equations are needed in order to solve the reactor design equations. The nature of these ancillary equations depends, in part, upon whether the reactor design equations are ATEs, IVODEs, DAEs, or BVODEs. Details are provided in Appendices I, J, K, and M. The next step in formulating the solution is to write the ancillary equations that are needed in order to solve the reactor design equations. There are three kinds of ancillary equations: those needed to calculate quantities that appear in the design equations, those that are needed to calculate initial and final values (only if the design equations are IVODEs), and those needed to calculate quantities of interest that are not found directly by solving the design equations.\nOnce the design equations and all of the necessary ancillary equations have been written, a brief summary of how to use them should be presented. More specifically, during numerical solution of the design equations certain quantities must be calculated. For each such quantity, the summary should identify the necessary equations and describe how to use them to calculate the quantity.\n\n\n7.2.3 Implementing the Solution Numerically\nOnce the solution has been formulated mathematically, the next step is to implement it numerically. This involves writing computer code that makes use of the equations presented in the mathematical formulation. There isn’t one single way to do this. Depending upon the software being used and the programmer’s preferences, the code can often be structured in a number of different ways. The next section presents the approach to structuring the code that will be used in Reaction Engineering Basics.\n\n\n7.2.4 Reporting the Results and Commenting\nFinally, the results should be presented and discussed. Any graphs or tables requested in the assignment should be included, and all questions asked in the assignment should be answered. In Reaction Engineering Basics, this section will additionally include pertinent comments and discussion of interesting or important aspects of the assignment and its solution.",

    "text": "7.3 Reactor Model Functions\nAs noted above, there are many ways to structure the computer code used to perform the calculations for a given reactor analysis assignment. The approach outlined here parallels the approach described above for formulating the solution. The code for implementation is broken into four component types, each of which serves a different purpose. Some of the calculataions will be performed by a mathematics software package. This section describes the code a reaaction engineer needs to write in order to use such packages.\n\n7.3.1 Making Variables Available Where Needed\nThe mathematical formulation described above begins by summarizing the information provided in the assignment. Part of that summary is a list of variables being used to represent quantities that are constant. It is usually necessary to use those constants at several points in the analysis. Rather than having to enter them each time they are needed, it is convenient to define them one time, in one place, and then make them available to all of the other code.\nSimilarly, in some analyses the current value of a variable quantity may need to be known at several places in the code. Most commonly this is accomplished by passing the variable as an argument to a computer function that needs it. In some situations, such as when using equation solvers from a mathematics software package, it isn’t possible to add that variable as a argument to a function that needs it. The software package dictates what is passed to the function as an argument, so a different way of supplying the variable must be implemented.\nConsequently, one part of the numerical implementation, often the first part, is responsible for making constants and, when necessary, the current values of variables available wherever they are needed in the numerical implementation code. The descriptions of numerical implementations in Reaction Engineering Basics will simply say something like “make the known constants and the current value of [name of variable] available for use in all equations.”\n\n\n7.3.2 Solving the Reactor Design Equations\nAfter the assignment summary, the first thing presented in a numerical formulation is the set of reactor design equations needed to model the reactor. Code that solves the reactor design equations is another component of the numerical implementation of the solution. In Reaction Engineering Basics, the code that solves the reactor design equations is referred to as the reactor model function.\nDepending upon the nature of the reactor analysis, variables may or may not be passed to the reactor model function as arguments. The reactor model function will use an equation solver from a mathematics software package to solve the equations. It must first calculate any quantities that the solver needs as input. For example, when solving ATEs, an initial guess for the solution must be provided, and when solving IVODEs, initial values and a stopping criterion must be provided.\nThe reactor model function would then call the appropriate solver, passing the required input variables to it. In addition to those variables, the reactor model function must pass the name of a function that the solver will use (see Appendices I, J, K, and M). For example, when solving ATEs, the reactor model function must pass the name of a function that calculates the residuals to the solver (Appendix I), and when solving IVODEs, the reactor model function must pass the name of a function that evaluates the derivatives to the solver (Appendix J).\nIn total, the responsibilities of the reactor model function are to calculate variables that the solver requires, call the solver, check that the solver succeeded in solving the design equations, and return the results. In Reaction Engineering Basics, the description of the numerical implementation of a solution will say that a reactor model function should be written. It will then list the arguments passed to it, if any, describe the calculations it performs, name the kind of equation solver it calls, list the arguments it passes to the solver (including the function name argument), and list what it returns.\n\n\n7.3.3 Calculating Quantities Used by Equation Solvers\nAs noted above, when the reactor model function calls a solver, one of the arguments it must provide is the name of a computer function. Those computer functions are a third component of a numerical implementation. When an ATE solver is called, the function whose name is provided to it will be referred to as a residuals function (see Appendix I). When an IVODE solver is called, the name of a derivatives function (Appendix J) is passed to it.\nThe arguments that a residuals function is passed and the values it returns are specified by the software package being used. The order in which the arguments are listed, the variable types of the arguments (scalar, vectors, etc.), the order in which the return variables appear, and the types of the return values are all specified by the software package being used. The same is true for derivatives functions. If the residuals function or the derivatives function needs other variables in order to perform its calculations, those variables must be provided in some other way than as an argument. The first part of a numerical solution, described above, takes care of this.\nSo basically, the reaction engineer must write residuals functions and derivatives functions that conform to the specifications of the software package they are using. Similar to reactor model functions, descriptions of numerical implementation in Reaction Engineering Basics will indicate that a residuals or derivatives function should be written, list the arguments passed to it, list variables available to it (as above), describe the calculations it performs, and list what it returns.\n\n\n7.3.4 Analyzing the Process\nThe remaining necessity in the numerical implementation is to complete the analysis. In essence, the reactor model function only solves the reactor design equations, and the other components described above simply support the reactor model function. Each analysis will be different. In one, the reactor model might need to be called multiple times to generate data for a graph. In another, the quantities of interest might still need to be calculated after the reactor design equations have been solved. In descriptions of numerical implementations in Reaction Engineering Basics, these actions will be listed after all of the functions that need to be written have been described.",

That process might include heat exchangers, other reactors, splitting and mixing of fluid streams, and many other types of equipment. Nonetheless, for analysis purposes it often is possible to draw an imaginary box around only the reactor, and treat it as an isolated system. If the reactor is a BSTR, SBSTR, CSTR or PFR, then the system consists of an isolated ideal reactor.\nAssignments that entail isolated ideal reactor analysis can be identified by the following distinguishing characteristics.\nReactor performance can be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. The quantitative analysis of an isolated ideal reactor requires a mathematical model of the reactor, and is the primary topic of the next several chapters. Before undertaking a quantitative analysis, it can be useful and insightful to perform a qualitative analysis.",

    "text": "The system consists of one ideal reactor and no other equipment.\nThe assignment describes the reactor and provides information about its operation.\nThe rate expressions are known for all reactions taking place in the reactor.\nThe quantities of interest in the assignment are reactor parameters, process parameters, reactor inputs and/or reactor outputs.\n\n\n\n8.1.1 Qualitative Reactor Analysis\nQualitative analysis focuses upon how the composition and temperature will vary as the reaction or reactions progress, but not on the magnitude of the variations. Chapter 6 noted that in batch reactors the time during which reactions occurs is measured using clock time and is equal to the time that has elapsed since the reaction was initiated. It further noted that in continuous flow systems, the time during which reactions occur is equal to the amount of time that the reagents spend in the reactor. It defined the space time, Equation 6.1, as one measure of the time reagents spend in the reactor. Reactions occur over time, so in qualitative analysis, changes in composition and temperature with increasing batch reaction time or flow reactor space time are of interest.\nBecause the analysis is qualitative, the rate expression is not used directly. Instead, the general behavior of reactions must be used, noting that for a typical reaction\n\nthe rate will increase if the temperature of the reacting system is increased,\nthe rate will decrease if the concentration of one or more reactants decreases,\nthe rate is not strongly affected by the concentration of the products if the reaction is irreversible,\nthe rate decreases as the concentration of the products increases if the reaction is reversible,\nthe equilibrium constant decreases as the temperature increases if the reaction is exothermic, and\nthe equilibrium constant increases as the temperature increases if the reaction is endothermic.\n\nOf course, not all reactions behave “typically.” The approach to qualitative analysis presented here also can be applied to atypical reactions if the general behavior above is appropriately adjusted. Atypical behavior can often be recognized by examining the rate expression, if it is available. For example, if the rate increases as the concentration of a product increases, the reaction is said to be autocatalytic, and the qualitative behavior can be adjusted accordingly.\nThe driving force for a chemical reaction is reducing the free energy of the system. Put differently, a chemical reaction always proceeds toward chemical reaction equilibrium. As a consequence, in an isothermal or adiabatic reactor, a single chemical reaction will never change direction spontaneously. To do so, the reaction would have to go beyond equilibrium and then turn around and go back. Since a single reaction will never change directions, the concentrations of the reactants will continually decrease over time and the concentrations of the products will continually increase over time until equilibrium is reached. As equilibrium is reached, the concentrations will stop changing over time.\nThe other factor to be considered in a qualitative analysis is the extent to which heat is added or removed as the reaction or reactions progress. There are a number of possibilities in this regard. Qualitative analysis is easiest and most reliable when only one reaction is taking place in a reactor that operates either adiabatically or isothermally. When only one exothermic reaction is taking place adiabatically, the temperature will rise continually since the reaction is releasing heat, and that heat is not being removed. Similarly, when only one endothermic reaction takes place adiabatically, the temperature will drop continually. When a reactor operates isothermally, the temperature does not change as the reaction proceeds. When a reactor is neither adiabatic nor isothermal, qualitative analysis can be more difficult with greater uncertainty in the results.\nWhen a reactor operates adiabatically or isothermally with only one or two reactions taking place, the shape of plots of concentration, temperature, rate, selectivity, etc. versus reaction time or space time can be predicted qualitatively as follows.\n\nDetermine the reactor operating procedure (e. g. isothermal or adiabatic).\nDetermine whether the reaction is typical or atypical, establishing the expected behavior as conditions change.\nDraw sets of axes for each graph with the quantity of interest on the y-axis and reaction time or space time on the x-axis.\nPlot a point on each y-axis representing the initial values of the quantities of interest. (The axes need not have a scale, and as such, plotted values only indicate whether the quantity is initially large, intermediate or small in value.)\nDetermine the initial slope of each graph by considering how the concentrations and temperature will change during a short interval of time and how those changes will affect the quantity of interest being plotted.\nDetermine the initial curvature of each graph by considering whether the changes in the next short interval of time will be greater than, equal to, or less than those in the first interval of time.\nDetermine whether the initial curvature eventually will result in the system approaching equilibrium (i. e. will each graph asymptotically approach a horizontal line?).\nIf the initial curvature will not lead to equilibrium, infer what must happen so that the system eventually will go to equilibrium (i. e. will there be an inflection point or a minimum/maximum?), and qualitatively explain what will cause these changes in the curvature.\n\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics, qualitative analyses of this type often will be used in the discussion of the results of a quantitative analysis. In that context, qualitative analysis can be used to answer the question, “Do these results make sense?” Additionally, performing a qualitative analysis after the quantitative analysis helps new reaction engineers develop a physical understanding of results that complements the mathematical understanding obtained in quantitative analysis. As a reaction engineer gains experience and develops the necessary skills and understanding, qualitative analysis can often provide insight and guidance before beginning an assignment. This is particularly true for design tasks, which are defined later in this chapter.\n\n\n8.1.2 Quantitative Reactor Analysis\nQuantitative analysis of reactors was discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. The discussion from those chapters will not be repeated here other than to repeat the general steps in the analysis. For a given type of ideal reactor, those same steps can be used with the same reactor design equations to accomplish four different kinds of reaction engineering tasks, as described in the next section.\n\nSummarizing the information provided in the assignment.\nFormulating the solution mathematically.\nImplementing the solution numerically.\nReporting and commenting upon the results.",

    "section": "8.2 Common Reaction Engineering Tasks",
    "text": "8.2 Common Reaction Engineering Tasks\nThe reactor design equations establish a quantitative relationship between the reactor inputs, the reactor outputs, and the reactor/process parameters. In any isolated reactor modeling assignment, the reaction engineer is given values for some of the inputs, outputs and parameters and tasked with determining the values of the others. For any one isolated reactor, the same reactor design equations and the same analysis steps, above, can be used to accomplish four kinds of tasks: response, optimization, design, and parameter estimation tasks. The difference between these tasks is found not in the equations themselves, but in how they are used.\nReactor response tasks, as defined here, are the most straightforward of the four tasks. In a reactor response assignment the reaction engineer is provided with a sufficient number of reactor variables to allow calculation of all of the quantities of interest. Generally there is a single, correct answer to a reactor response assignment.\nSometimes a reactor response assignment will ask for a graph where a quantity of interest is plotted versus some other reactor variable. This is still a reactor response task. The only difference is that the reactor design equations are solved multiple times to generate the data to be plotted. Each time the reactor design equations are solved, there is a single, correct answer, and consequently, there is a single correct graph that completes the task.\nIn optimization tasks the number of reactor variables that are specified or known is not sufficient to allow the reaction engineer to solve the reactor design equations and calculate the quantities of interest. The simplest example would task the engineer to maximize a quantity of interest (the target) with respect to some other reactor variable (the adjusted variable). Neither the value of the targe nor the value of the adjusted variable are known. In lieu of knowing their actual values, the reaction engineer instead knows that it is the maximum value that the target can be attained by varying the adjusted variable. Typically the engineer is tasked to find both the maximum value of the target and the corresponding value of the adjusted variable. Again, generally there is a single correct answer to a reactor optimization assignment.\nKnowing that the reactor design equations will be solved numerically, there are three ways the reaction engineer could approach an optimization task. In the first two a range of values of the adjusted variable would be selected and the design equations would be solved repeatedly to find the value of the target corresponding to each value of the adjusted variable. In one approach, a table is generated with one column for the target and one column for the adjusted variable. The column for the target would be scanned to identify the maximum value. The corresponding value of the adjusted variable is found in the other column in the same row.\nThe second second differs in that instead of tabulating the results from solving the reactor design equations, they are plotted. The maximum in the graph is identified and the maximum value of the target and the corresponding value of the adjusted variable are read from the graph. In both of these approaches, it is possible that a maximum will not be present. In that case, the range of values of the adjusted variable must be increased until a maximum is observed. Once a maximum is observed, the precision of the results can be improved by adding many additional values of the adjusted variable between the two points that bracket the maximum.\nMany software packages include a function (an optimizer) that performs optimization, that is finds a maximum or minimum. The third approach involves using such an optimizer. In this case, the numerical implementation of the solution would entail writing a reactor model function that receives the adjusted variable as an argument and returns the corresponding quantity of interest. That reactor model function would then be passed to the optimizer. Typically an initial guess for the optimum value of the adjusted variable would also need to be provided.\nOptimization tasks can be much more complicated than simply maximizing a quantity of interest with respect to another reactor variable. In addition to specifying multiple adjusted variables, the assignment also could impose constraints on the values of one or more reactor variables (not just the adjusted variables). Constraints are conditions that must be obeyed. An example of a constraint would be that the temperature of the heat exchange fluid cannot exceed some specified value because it would boil or decompose above that temperature. Again, there are software packages that will perform constrained, multi-variable optimization.\nReactor design tasks are the most complicated of the tasks considered here. At the same time they can be intellectually stimulating, affording the reaction engineer an opportunity to be creative. A reactor design assignment does not provide sufficient information to solve the reactor design equations. The reaction engineer must choose values for the missing reactor variables. In more extreme cases, the assignment may provide little more than the reagents that are available and the products that are to be produced. The type of reactor to use and how to operate it may be among the choices the reaction engineer needs to make.\nDesign tasks almost always involve an optimization sub-task. The quantity that needs to be maximized is typically financial in nature. The goal is to maximize the rate of making profit subject to both technical and financial constraints. Design at this level is typically taught in chemical engineering courses on plant design, and the system being optimized is typically an entire process, not just an isolated reactor.\nThat level of design task is well beyond the scope of Reaction Engineering Basics. However, highly simplified design tasks are presented herein. In general there are reactor variables that are related to the finances of an overall process. For example, the cost of operating a process may scale with the temperature of that process, in which case minimizing the temperature minimizes the operating cost. In general, there is not a single correct solution to a reactor design assignment. Design tasks are inherently “open-ended,” and multiple solutions are possible and acceptable.\nParameter estimation tasks are inherently different from the three types of tasks described above, but they do use the same reactor design equations and the same solution steps. Briefly, a parameter estimation task involves generating data using a reactor and then using a model for the reactor to estimate the values of parameters appearing in a rate expression. Parameter estimation tasks are not considered in this section of Reaction Engineering Basics, but in Chapters 18 through 21.\n\nThe next two Chapters, 9 and 10, examine the analysis of non-continuous reactors and present examples involving response and optimization tasks. That affords the reader an opportunity to gain some understanding of the qualitative and quantitative differences between BSTRs and SBSTRs, which is necessary for the design of non-continuous reactors in the following Chapter, 11. Following that, analysis of continuous reactors is considered in Chapters 12 and 13. Similarly, they afford the reader an opportunity to gain some understanding of the qualitative and quantitative differences between CSTRs and PFRs, which is necessary for the design of continuous reactors in Chapter 14, which also considers the choice between continuous and non-continuous reactors.",

    "text": "9.1 BSTR Characteristics\nThe two most important characteristics of a BSTR are that (a) the reacting fluid within it is perfectly mixed, and (b) there is no flow of reagents into or out of a BSTR while it is operating, that is, during reaction. As the name batch stirred tank reactor suggests, the most common physical form of a BSTR for chemical processing is a stirred tank. As indicated in the schematic representations in Figure 9.1, they are typically cylindrical in shape, completely containing the reacting fluid (indicated by blue shading) within rigid walls. When processing liquids, there may be some space at the top of the reactor that does not contain reacting fluid. This is referred to as headspace; it is indicated by gray shading in figure. There must be some means of thoroughly and rapidly mixing the reacting fluid. Commonly an agitator is immersed in the reacting fluid for this purpose.\nIf it is necessary to heat or cool the reactor, a heat exchange fluid (indicated by yellow shading in the figure) may flow in and out of the the reactor during operation, but the heat exchange fluid is physically separated from the reacting fluid. Figure 9.1 depicts three common configurations for exchange of heat with an external fluid. One (a in the figure) is referred to as a shell or jacket. It is a compartment that surrounds the reacting fluid and has an external heat exchange fluid flowing through it. Another (b in the figure) consists of a coil of tubing that is submerged in the reacting fluid. The heat exchange fluid flows within the coil. The third (c in the figure) is an external heat exchanger. With the latter configuration it is important that the reacting fluid circulates through the heat exchanger rapidly so that the assumption of perfect mixing of the reacting fluid is satisfied. In all three configurations, it is possible that the exchange fluid temperature is not uniform, but in Reaction Engineering Basics the heat exchange fluid is always assumed to be perfectly mixed.\nStirred tanks are not often used for the processing of gases or when a solid catalyst is being used because stirring gases or small solid particles is difficult. However, configurations different from a stirred tank can be modeled as BSTRs as long as the critical assumptions are met (perfect mixing and no reagent flow in or out of the reactor). Chapter 19 describes a few laboratory BSTRs that are not stirred tanks. Similarly, any reactor in a chemical processing facility that conforms to the assumptions used when deriving the BSTR design equations can be modeled as a BSTR. Heat can be added or removed from a reactor in ways that do not involve an exchange fluid. For example, an electric resistance heating element might be used to add heat. Reaction Engineering Basics only considers heat transfer to or from a perfectly mixed heat exchange fluid.\nThere are advantages to using a BSTR, as opposed to the other types of ideal reactors, particularly the flow reactors (CSTRs and PFRs). BSTRs offer flexibility both in terms of the reactions being run and in the details of operating the process. In a situation where the demand for products is too small to warrant continuous production, a batch reactor might be used to make one product for a few weeks, and then be used to make a different product for the next few weeks. This kind of flexibility avoids having the reactor sit idle for extended periods of time. Similarly, if the production of a product involves heating to and holding at two or more different temperatures during processing, it may be easier to produce it in a batch reactor than to set up a chain of continuous reactors operating at the necessary temperatures. Similarly, if the addition of one reagent needs to be delayed, it may be possible to do so using a BSTR as described below under BSTR Operation. Again, this may be preferred over two continuous reactors operating in series with that reagent added to the second reactor. In contrast to PFRs, a much broader range of heat transfer area per volume of reacting fluid is possible. Even after the reactor has been constructed, the length of a submerged coil or the area of an external heat exchanger can be altered if additional heat transfer capability is needed.\nThere are also disadvantages to using BSTRs. As described below, the operation of a BSTR includes periods of time during which no reaction is taking place. Compared to reactors like CSTRs and PFRs that run continuously, this can lead to a lower net rate of production. Additionally, the operation of a BSTR is more labor intensive than operation of a continuous reactor. This adds to the cost of production, meaning a higher product selling price is necessary in order to make a profit. Another issue with batch processes is that of batch-to-batch consistency. As an example, consider the batch production of an expensive perfume. It is critically important that every batch smells the same. Consequently, in addition to being labor intensive, batch processing requires well-trained operators who are careful to precisely follow the specified operational procedure and not deviate from it. Food and beverage production similarly demand high batch-to-batch consistency. This can be even more challenging if, as an example, the process utilizes agricultural reagents that can vary from season to season or year to year.\nIn light of their advantages and disadvantages, BSTRs are often used to produce value-added products. These are products for which the market demand is smaller, but the price, and therefore the profit per pound, is greater. This is in contrast to commodity products where the demand for large quantities is high, but the price per pound is relatively small. High volume production is usually performed in a continuous reactor (CSTR or PFR).",

    "section": "9.2 BSTR Operation",
    "text": "9.2 BSTR Operation\nBy its nature, there are times during which reaction is not taking place in a batch reactor. Before reaction can take place, the reactor must first be cleaned (or, in some cases, sterilized) to remove anything “left behind” by the last reaction that was run. Then the reactants must be prepared and charged into the reactor. From this point on, the operation is much like a cooking recipe. A prescribed series of heating and cooling steps is followed, with reaction taking place during every step. A simple example might be that after the reactants are charged, the reactor is heated to a specified temperature, held at that temperature for a specified length of time, and then cooled back to room temperature. In almost all situations, the reaction has ceased by the end of the last step, either because one of the reactants has been fully consumed or because the temperature has been lowered to the point where the rate is effectively zero. The last step in the operating protocol then is to remove the product from the reactor. Often it is transferred to a holding tank from which it can be sent elsewhere for further processing, purification, or longer term storage.\nOf course, the operational protocol, i. e. the “recipe,” could be more complicated, requiring any number of steps (also called stages). In some cases an intermediate stage in the operational protocol might call for the addition of a reagent. As long as that reagent is added instantaneously, the reactor can be analyzed as a BSTR. However, if the reagent is added over time as reactions continue to occur, the reactor is no longer a BSTR and that phase of processing must be analyzed as a semi-batch reactor (Chapter 10).\nIt is very important to recognize that the productivity of the reactor, that is the amount of product it produces per hour, must be calculated taking the so-called turnaround time into account. That is, one must include the time needed to clean, fill and drain the reactor, not just the length of time during which reaction takes place. Doing so permits the definition of the net rate of generation of reagent \\(i\\) given in Equation 9.1.\n\\[\nr_{i,net} = \\frac{n_i - n_{i,0}}{t_{rxn} + t_{turn}}\n\\tag{9.1}\\]\nEven if the turnaround time was zero, it would still be desirable to define a net rate as above. The net rate is useful for characterizing the overall process. As the reaction is progressing, the rate of reaction is continually changing because the temperature and composition are changing. The rate of reaction at any one time during the processing is referred to as the instantaneous rate at that time. The net rate defined in Equation 9.1 is a kind of average of the instantaneous rate over the processing time. Similarly, it is sometimes useful to differentiate between overall and instantaneous values of other quantities such as yields, conversions, selectivities, etc.",

    "section": "9.3 Qualitative Analysis of Reaction in a BSTR",
    "text": "9.3 Qualitative Analysis of Reaction in a BSTR\nA simple process for the qualitative analysis of a reacting system was presented in Chapter 8. In a BSTR, there are no spatial variations in temperature or composition because the reactor is perfectly mixed. Therefore, qualitative analysis of a BSTR is used to determine how temperature, reaction rate, composition and related quantities (conversion, selectivity) vary with reaction time.\nFor purposes of illustration, suppose the typical, irreversible, exothermic reaction, \\(A \\rightarrow Z\\) takes place in an isothermal BSTR. In this situation, only the concentrations need to be considered because in an isothermal reactor the temperature does not change. At the start of the process, the concentration of A will be high and that of Z will be small or zero. During a very small interval of time at the start of the process the concentration of A will decrease and the concentration of Z will increase due to the reaction starting to take place. Hence, in a plot of the concentration of reactant A versus reaction time, the \\(y\\)-intercept will be high and the slope at that point will be negative. For the product, Z, the \\(y\\)-intercept will be low or zero and the initial slope will be positive.\nThe changes in composition will affect the reaction rate. For a typical, irreversible reaction, the decrease in the reactant concentration will tend to decrease the rate while the increase in the product concentration will not affect it. Consequently, at the end of that small interval of reaction time, the rate will be smaller.\nIn the next small interval of time, the concentration of the reactant, A, will decrease by less than it did in the first interval because the rate is lower. For the same reason, the concentration of the product, Z, will increase by less than it did during the first interval of time. In terms of graphs showing the concentrations versus time, the concentration of the reactant, A, will start high with a negative slope and a curvature that is concave upward. That is, the slope will become less steep as the reaction time increases. In like manner, a graph showing the concentration of Z versus reaction time will start at or near zero with a positive slope and a curvature that is concave downward (i. e. the slope again will get less steep as the reaction time increases).\nIf that initial behavior continued throughout the process, the concentration of the reactant would decrease with a smaller and smaller slope until finally reaching a horizontal plateau at a value of zero (because the reaction is irreversible and therefor goes to completion). The concentration of the product would increase with a smaller and smaller slope until finally reaching a plateau at a value equal to the initial concentration of A (because in the reaction being considered, the stoichiometry is 1 Z per A). The results of this qualitative analysis are shown in Figure 9.2. Qualitative analysis is not limited to reagent concentrations. Graphs showing conversion, selectivity, rate, temperature, etc. vs. time can also be generated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Qualitative reactant (left) and product (right) concentration profiles during isothermal reaction in a BSTR.\n\n\n\nThe qualitative analysis here was straightforward because the reactor was isothermal. In Example 9.6.1 the qualitative analysis of an adiabatic BSTR is presented. That analysis is more complicated because both concentrations and temperature are changing. In fact, the changes in composition and temperature, taken separately, would affect the rate in opposite ways. As a consequence there is greater uncertainty in the qualitative analysis results.",

    "section": "9.4 BSTR Design Equations",
    "text": "9.4 BSTR Design Equations\nThe reactor design equations for BSTRs are derived in Appendix H and discussed in Chapter 6. The BSTR mole and energy balances shown below were presented in Equations 6.8 and 6.9. Chapter 6 also presented the energy balances shown below for a heat exchange fluid that transfers sensible heat, Equation 6.2, and one that transfers latent heat, Equation 6.6. That chapter also describes how to select the specific reactor design equations needed to model BSTRs under different circumstances. That discussion will not be duplicated here.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\frac{dV}{dt}  = \\dot Q - \\dot W - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to notice that the \\(V\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and \\(P\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) terms in the reacting fluid energy balance will have units of pressure volume time-1. Most of the other terms will have units of energy time-1. This means that a unit conversion is needed. One easy way to do this is to multiply the \\(V\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and \\(P\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) terms by the ideal gas constant in units of energy mol-1 temperature-1 and divide by the ideal gas constant in units of pressure volume mol-1 temperature-1. The moles and temperatures cancel out giving the necessary conversion factor. This works even for a liquid phase system because the ideal gas law is not being used as the equation of state (i. e. to convert from pressure volume to mol temperature). In Reaction Engineering Basics the rate of doing work, \\(\\dot{W}\\) is almost always negligible. However, if it is non-zero, it will likely have units of power (e. g. hp) or pressure volume time-1, and again a unit conversion is needed.\n\n\n\nThe design equations can often be simplified. As noted in Chapter 6, if the reactor walls are rigid (or if an ideal, incompressible liquid is being processed) then the volume, \\(V\\), will be constant and its time derivative, \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\), will equal zero. If the work associated with agitation is negligible (it usually is) and there are no other shafts or moving boundaries, then the rate at which the reacting fluid performs work, \\(\\dot W\\), on its surroundings is also equal to zero. When an ideal, incompressible liquid is being processed, the pressure, \\(P\\), is constant and its time derivative, \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\), is equal to zero. (The pressure gradient within the reacting fluid due to the hydrostatic head is neglibible.) Finally, for liquids, Equation 6.10 showed how the sensible heat term in Equation 6.9 can be expressed in terms of the mass-specific or volume-specific heat capacity of the solution as a whole instead of the individual molar heat capacities.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\nWhen rate expressions are substituted into the BSTR mole and energy balances, they typically introduce concentrations or partial pressures of reagents. When the design equations are solved, those concentrations and partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the molar amounts of the reagents (see Appendix J). The concentration is simply the molar amount divided by the volume, Equation 1.7.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{n_i}{V}\n\\]\nFor ideal gases, the partial pressure is related to the molar amount through the ideal gas law, Equation 1.12.\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{n_iRT}{V}\n\\]\nWhen heat transfer involves an exchange fluid as shown in Figure 9.1, the rate of heat exchange in the energy balances can be calculated using Equation 6.18. If the reactor operates adiabatically (i. e. it is perfectly insulated and does not have a shell, coil or external heat exchanger), \\(\\dot{Q}\\) is equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\dot Q = UA\\left( T_{ex} - T \\right)\n\\]",

    "text": "9.5 General Approach to Modeling Isolated BSTRs\nChapter 8 described how to identify a reaction engineering assignment that involves the modeling of an isolated ideal reactor, and Chapter 7 suggested a four step approach to reactor analysis.\n\nSummarize the information provided in the assignment.\nFormulate the solution mathematically.\nImplement the solution numerically.\nReport and comment upon the results.\n\nThis section describes the application of that approach to the modeling of an isolated BSTR. The process may seem a bit abstract when first read, but it should become clearer after seeing it used in the examples provided at the end of this chapter.\nOften the operational protocol for a BSTR has multiple heating and cooling stages. When this is true, each stage of the protocol may need to be analyzed separately from the other stages because terms in the reactor design equations may change. The reactor design equations for BSTRs are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs) with elapsed time, \\(t\\), as the independent variable. The stages occur sequentially, and consequently the values of \\(t\\) and the dependent variables at the end of one stage in the operating protocol become the initial values for the next stage. The one exception to this is if a reagent is instantaneously added at the end of a stage. In that situation, the initial values for the next stage are the result of mixing the added reagent with the reagents in the BSTR at the end of the previous stage.\nSummarizing the information provided in the assignment. An assignment summary is useful in that it extracts the critical information from the assignment narrative and presents it as a concise summary. A procedure for creating an assignment summary is presented in Chapter 7. There are three components in the assignment summary: a list of all known and given constants with the variable symbols being used to represent them, a description of the reactor and its operation, and a list of the quantities of interest indicating the variable symbols being used to represent them. When analyzing a BSTR, the second component will indicate the number of stages in the operational protocol and whether the BSTR is isothermal, adiabatic, heated, or cooled in those stages.\nFormulating the solution mathematically. For an assignment involving the analysis of a BSTR, it will always be necessary to write the reactor design equations that are needed to model that specific BSTR. Selecting which equations are needed to model a given BSTR and simplifying those design equations was described in Chapter 6 and in the preceding section of this chapter.\nAs noted above, the design equations for an isolated BSTR will be a set of IVODEs with \\(t\\) as the independent variable. The dependent variables will always include the molar amounts of the reagents present in the system, \\(n_i\\). Depending which other design equation are needed to model the BSTR, the dependent variables may also include the temperature of the reacting fluid, \\(T\\), its pressure, \\(P\\), and either the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, \\(T_{ex}\\), or the fraction of the exchange fluid that undergoes phase change, \\(\\gamma\\).\nIf the reacting fluid is an ideal gas and the reactor design equations include an energy balance on the reacting fluid, the temperature and the pressure will appear as a dependent variables. Consequently, the number of dependent variables will be one greater than the number of IVODEs. In this situation either a dependent variable must be eliminated from the design equations or another IVODE must be added to them (Appendix J). A differential form of the ideal gas law, Equation 6.11, is used to accomplish that. For a BSTR, \\(V\\) is constant so its time derivative is zero, and does not appear in the differential form of the gas law. The differential ideal gas law can either be added to the reactor design equations, making the number of equations equal to the number of dependent variables, or it can be solved for \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\), substituting the result into the energy balance and thereby eliminating \\(P\\) as a dependent variable. Both of these approaches are illustrated in Example 9.6.3.\n\\[\nRT\\left( \\sum_i \\frac{dn_i}{dt} \\right) + R\\left( \\sum_i n_i \\right)\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\n\\]\nThe reactor design equations will be solved numerically, so if they are not in the form of derivative expressions (see Appendix J), they should be converted to that form. Once that has been accomplished, a table identifying the initial values and stopping criterion can be created. For the first stage of the operational protocol, the initial value of \\(t\\) should be 0.0. The other initial values and the known final value should be indicated using the same variable symbol as that used in the assignment summary. If an initial or final value is not known, an appropriate variable symbol should be chosen to represent it. Quite commonly, a subscripted zero is added to indicate an initial value and a subscripted “f” is used to denote a final value.\nThe next sections of the mathematical formulation consist of ancillary equations of three types. When the BSTR design equations are solved numerically, it will be necssary to evaluate the derivatives, using known constants and the independent and dependent variables. Before that can be done, unknown constants and variables other than \\(t\\) and the dependent variables must be calculated. Equations that can be used to calculate the unknown constants and extra variables are the first kind of ancillary equations.\nWhen an IVODE solver is called to solve the BSTR design equations, the initial values and the stopping criterion must be passed to it. The second set of ancillary equations are those that are needed to calculate any initial or final values that are unknown. The third set of ancillary equations are those that are needed to calculate quantities of interest other than those found by solving the BSTR design equations. (Solving the reactor design equations only yields values of the molar amounts, the temperature, the pressure, and either the exchange fluid temperature of the fraction of the exchange fluid that condenses.)\nThe mathematical formulation concludes with a succinct description of how to use the equations to evaluate the derivatives, calculate the initial values, and calculate other quantities of interest. In some analyses an ATE solver must be used to calculate an unknown constant (again, see Appendix J). In this case, the calculations summary additionally includes a description of how to calculate the residual associated with the ATE. All of these calculations are used in the numerical implementation of the solution.\nImplementing the solution numerically. The numerical implementation of the solution involves writing computer code. Herein the implementation is described in terms of a set of separate functions (see Chapter 7). One function defines constants and makes them available to all other functions. In some cases a variable may also be made available to the other functions. A derivatives function is used to evaluate the derivatives and a residual function is used to evaluate the residual, if an ATE is also being solved. A reactor model function is responsible for calling an IVODE solver and thereby solving the reactor design equations. Top-level code or a master function is responsible for calculating the unknown constant, if there is one, calling the reactor model function to solve the BSTR design equations, calculating any other quantities of interest, and generating any requested tables or graphs. In this chapter the numerical implementation is described generally without reference to specific software packages. Familiarity with the numerical solution of IVODEs at the level of Appendix J and ATEs at the level of Appendix I is assumed.\nReporting and discussing the results is straightforward and does not require exposition here.",

    "text": "9.6 Examples\nThe examples in this section illustrate the analysis of isolated BSTRs. Examples 9.6.1 and 9.6.2 are response assignments where the assignment specifies a sufficient number of quantities so that the reactor design equations can be solved to find the quantities of interest. In Example 9.6.1 all necessary reactor inputs and process parameters are specified and the quantities of interest are related to reactor outputs. In Example 9.6.2 two reactor outputs are specified (the reaction time and the conversion), and one of the unknown quantities of interest is a reactor input (the initial temperature). In addition to illustrating the computational procedure for these two types of response tasks, Example 9.6.1 involves a single reaction taking place in an adiabatic BSTR while Example 9.6.2 features two reactions taking place in a BSTR that is cooled using an exchange fluid. Examples 9.6.3 and 9.6.4 are optimization assignments that identify a reactor variable that must be maximized or minimized by specifying a reactor input. The BSTR operational protocol in Example 9.6.3, like those in Examples 9.6.1 and 9.6.2, consists of a single stage, but unlike the other examples, the reacting fluid is a gas and not a liquid. Example 9.6.4 illustrates a situation where there are multiple stages in the operating protocol. It also considers turnaround time and the net rate of reaction.\n\n9.6.1 Concentration, Temperature and Rate Profiles during Adiabatic Operation of a BSTR\nThe liquid-phase reaction between A and B, equation (1), is irreversible. At the conditions of interest in this assignment, the heat of reaction is constant and equal to -101.2 kJ mol-1. The rate expression is given in equation (2), where the rate coefficient exhibits Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 5.11 x 104 L mol-1 s-1 and an activation energy of 74.8 kJ mol-1.\nTwo solutions, one containing only reagent A at 180 °C and one containing only reagent B at 180 °C, are charged to an adiabatic BSTR producing 1900 L of solution initially containing 2.9 mol A L-1 and 3.2 mol B L-1 at 180 °C. The solution is ideal and has a constant heat capacity of 1.23 cal g-1 K-1 and a constant density of 1.02 g cm-3. Plot the concentrations of A, B, Y, and Z, the reacting fluid temperature, and the instantaneous reaction rate for the first 2 h of reaction, and comment upon the shapes of the graphs.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_AC_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment describes a single BSTR and no other equipment. The rate expression for the reaction taking place in the reactor is provided, and the quantities of interest are reactor variables. I know from Chapter 8 that this combination of characteristics identifies this as an isolated ideal reactor modeling assignment.\nI’ll start by summarizing the given constants, the reactor type and operation, and the quantities of interest. I will use appropriate variable symbols for each quantity, e. g. \\(n\\) for molar amounts, \\(T\\) for temperatures, etc. For quantities that are initial values, I will add a subscripted “0” and for final values I will add a subscripted “f”. I’ll also add the ideal gas constant to the given constants. Numerical solution of the design equations will yield sets of corresponding values of the independent and dependent variables that span the range from their initial values to their final values. I’ll use \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\), etc. to represent those quantities of interest.\n\n\n\n\n9.6.1.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -101.2 kJ mol-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 5.11 x 104 L mol-1 s-1, \\(E_1\\) = 74.8 kJ mol-1, \\(V\\) = 1900 L, \\(T_0\\) = (180 + 273.15) K, \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 2.9 mol L-1, \\(C_{B,0}\\) = 3.2 mol L-1, \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\) = 1.23 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\rho\\) = 1.02 g cm-3, \\(t_f\\) = 2 h, and \\(R\\) = 8.314 J mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Adiabatic BSTR with a 1-stage operational protocol.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(C_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_Y\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(r\\left(t\\right)\\) as graphs.\n\n\n9.6.1.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nReactor analysis always requires a set of reactor design equations. The selection of the specific design equations for a given analysis was described in Chapter 6. Mole balances are always needed. I’ll write a BSTR mole balance, Equation 6.8, on each of the reagents. In this assignment, only one reaction is taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\nu_i r\n\\]\nThis BSTR is not isothermal, so the mole balances cannot be solved independently of an energy balance on the reacting fluid, Equation 6.9. In this assignment the reacting fluid is a liquid which I will assume to be an incompressible ideal solution. Consequently, the reacting fluid volume and the total pressure are constant, and their time derivatives are equal to zero. The reactor is adiabatic, so the rate of heat input, \\(\\dot{Q}\\), is equal to zero. There are no shafts or moving boundaries other than the agitator, and the rate at which it performs work is negligible, so \\(\\dot{W}\\) is also equal to zero. With only one reaction taking place, the summation over the reactions reduces to a single term. This assignment provides the mass-specific heat capacity of the entire solution, so the sensible heat term can be re-written using that heat capacity, Equation 6.10. Finally, the energy balance can be put in the form of a derivative expression by dividing both sides by \\(\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p\\).\n\\[\n\\cancelto{\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p}{\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right)} \\frac{dT}{dt} - \\cancelto{0}{V\\frac{dP}{dt}}  - \\cancelto{0}{P\\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - V \\cancelto{r \\Delta H}{\\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt} = - V r_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{V r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p}\n\\]\nIn this assignment the BSTR operates adiabatically, so there isn’t an exchange fluid, and an exchange fluid energy balance cannot be written. Momentum balances are not used with stirred tank reactors. This gives five reactor design equations that contain five dependent variables, so it is not necessary to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable. So for this reactor, the design equation consist of mole balances on A, B, Y, and Z and an energy balance on the reacting fluid.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z are presented in equations (3) through (6), and the energy balance on the reacting fluid is given by equation (7).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -r_1V \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = -r_1V \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Y}{dt} = r_1V \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = r_1V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\rho \\tilde{C}_p} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial values and a stopping criterion are needed when solving IVODEs. The instant at which the two solutions are charged into the reactor can be defined as \\(t=0\\). The initial values are then the molar amounts of the reagents and the temperature at that instant. The two solutions that were charged to the BSTR did not contain reagent Y or reagent Z, so their initial amounts are zero. The final value of the time in this assignment is 2 h, which I represented as \\(t_f\\) in the list of known constants. Consequently the stopping criterion is that \\(t=t_f\\).\n\n\n\nIntial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3) through (7).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_f\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(n_{B,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Y\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 9.1.\nI’ll start by writing the equations that I’ll need in order to evaluate the derivatives appearing in the reactor design equations. The design equations are in the form of derivative expressions, so no further manipulation is needed.\nI’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions.\nHere, the only other variable is \\(r_1\\). The assignment provides the rate expression, equation (2), which can be used to calculate \\(r_1\\). However, the rate expression contains the rate coefficient, \\(k_1\\), and the concentrations of A and B. They, too, will need to be calculated before \\(r_1\\) can be calculated. The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8. The defining equation for concentration in a closed system, Equation 1.7, can be used to calculate the concentrations of A and B.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\nThe rate, \\(r_1\\), appearing in the reactor design equations can be calculated using the given rate expression, equation (2). The rate coefficient, \\(k_1\\), appearing in equation (2) can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, equation (8). The concentrations can be calculated using equations (9) and (10).\n\\[\nk = k_{0,1}\\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_B = \\frac{n_B}{V} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to know the initial and final values in Table 9.1. Checking the the given and known constants in the assignment summary shows that the initial values, \\(n_{A,0}\\) and \\(n_{B,0}\\) are not known. The assignment does provide the initial concentrations of A and B and the fluid volume, so I can calculate the initial molar amounts using the defining equation for concentration.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values\nThe initial molar amounts of A and B in Table 9.1 can be calculated using equations (11) and (12).\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = C_{A,0}V \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{B,0} = C_{B,0}V \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the IVODEs can be solved for \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Y\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\) in the range from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=t_f\\). Only one of those results, \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\) is a quantity of interest. All the other quantities of interest still need to be calculated. Yet again, the defining equation for concentration can be used to calculate the concentrations. The instantaneous rate can then be calculated using the rate expression.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating Other Quantities of Interest\nWith the information given above, equations (3) through (7) can be solved for corresponding sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\) that span the range from their initial values to their final values. The concentrations of A, B, Y, and Z, at each time can then be calculated using equations (9), (10), (13), and (14). Then, knowing \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), and \\(T\\), at each time, the instantaeous rate in that range can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, equation (8), and the rate expression, equation (2).\n\\[\nC_Y = \\frac{n_Y}{V} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_Z = \\frac{n_B}{V} \\tag{14}\n\\]\nCalculations Summary\n\nSubstitute given and known constants into all equations.\nWhen it is necessary to evaluate the derivatives\n\n\\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\) will be available.\nCalculate \\(k_1\\), \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) using equations (8), (9), and (10),\nCalculate \\(r_1\\) using equation (2), and\nCalculate the values of the derivatives using equations (3) through (7).\n\nWhen it is necessary to calculate the initial and final values in Table 9.1\n\n\\(T_0\\) and \\(t_f\\) are known constants.\nCalculate the initial values, \\(n_{A,0}\\) and \\(n_{B,0}\\), use equations (11) and (12).\n\nWhen it is necessary to calculate the quantities of interest, \\(C_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_Y\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(r\\left(t\\right)\\)\n\nCorresponding sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\), spanning the range from their initial values to their final values will be available.\nCalculate corresponding values of \\(k_1\\), \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), \\(C_Y\\), and \\(C_Z\\) using equations (8), (9), (10), (13), and (14).\nCalculate corresponding values of \\(r_1\\) using equation (2).\n\n\n\n\n9.6.1.3 Numerical Implementation of the Solution\n\nMake the given and known constants available for use in all functions.\nWrite a derivatives function that\n\nreceives the independent and dependent variables, \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\), as arguments,\nevaluates the derivatives as described in step 2 of the calculations summary, and\nreturns the resulting values of the derivatives.\n\nWrite a reactor model function that\n\ncalculates the initial and final values in Table 9.1 as described in step 3 of the calculations summary,\ngets corresponding sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\), spanning the range from their initial values to their final values by calling an IVODE solver and passing the following information to it\n\nthe initial values and stopping criterion in Table 9.1 and\nthe name of the derivatives function from step 2 above, c, checks that the solver successfully solved the IVODEs, and\n\nreturns the values returned by the IVODE solver.\n\nPerform the analysis by\n\ncalling the reactor model function from step 3 to get sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\),\ncalculating the other quantities of interest, \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), \\(C_Y\\), \\(C_Z\\), and \\(r_1\\), as described in step 4 of the calculation summary, and\ngenerating the requested graphs.\n\n\n\n\n9.6.1.4 Results and Discussion\nThe calculations were performed as described above. The variation of concentrations of reagents, A, B, Y, and Z, during the first two hours of operation of the BSTR are shown in Figure 9.3. The variation of the reacting fluid temperature during that period is shown in Figure 9.4, and the variation of the instantaneous rate is shown in Figure 9.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Concentrations versus reaction time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Temperature versus reaction time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Rate versus reaction time.\n\n\n\nThe concentrations of the reactants, A and B, decrease monotonically during the first two hours of operation while the concentrations of the products, Y and Z, increase. The temperature increases steadily, too. The variation of the reaction rate is different. Initially it increases, but then it passes through a maximum after which it steadily decreases.\nQualitative Analysis\nA qualitative analysis shows that the variations in the concentrations, temperature and rate seen in Figures 9.3, 9.4, and 9.5 are expected. At \\(t=0\\), the concentrations of the reagents and the temperature are all at their initial values.\nAt that point the rate is positive, so after a short interval of time the concentrations of A and B will have decreased slightly and the concentrations of Y and Z will have increased slightly due to the occurrence of the reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic and the reactor operates adiabatically, the temperature will have increased due to the heat released by the reaction.\nThe rate could either increase or decrease during this short interval. The concentrations of the reactants, A and B, are decreasing, and this alone would cause the rate to decrease. However, at the same time the temperature is increasing, and that alone would cause the rate to increase. Generally, at the start of the reaction the exponential dependence of the rate upon the temperature will be stronger than its dependence upon the reactant concentrations, and the rate will increase. This is seen to be the case in Figure 9.5. (Had the heat of reaction been very small, leading to a small increase in the temperature, it is possible that the rate would have decreased, especially if the activation was also small).\nTo summarize, during that initial short interval of time, the concentrations of Y and Z, the temperature, and the rate all have positive slopes while the concentrations of A and B have negative slopes. During the next short interval of time, the rate is larger than during the first interval of time. As a consequence, the concentrations and temperature will change more during the second interval. That means that the curvature of the temperature, Y concentration, and Z concentration profiles is initially concave upward and the curvature of the A and B concentration profiles is initially concave downward. Again during this second short interval, opposing effects on the rate are associated with the decreasing reactant concentrations and the increasing temperature.\nIt is hard to see in Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4, but because initially the rate is increasing, the concentrations of A and B are decreasing faster and faster and the concentrations of Y and Z and the temperature are increasing faster and faster. These trends cannot continue indefinitely, if they did, \\(C_Y\\), \\(C_Z\\), and \\(T\\) would approach positive infinity and \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) would approach negative infinity.\nIn fact, the curvature does change because at some point the effect of decreasing reactant concentrations upon the rate becomes stronger than the effect of increasing temperature. At the point where the two effects become equal, the rate reaches a maximum. Beyond the maximum, the effect of decreasing reactant concentration dominates and the rate decreases. This is seen in Figure 9.5 where the instantaneous rate passes through a maximum.\nAt the point where the rate reaches its maximum value, the concentration and temperature profiles exhibit an inflection point. (Again, in this example this is very, very subtle and cannot be discerned in the figures.) Beyond that point, the \\(C_Y\\), \\(C_Z\\), and \\(T\\) profiles are concave downward and the \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) are concave upward. That is, the changes over time become smaller and smaller. This behavior can continue indefinitely. Eventually the concentrations and temperature will stop changing and become constant. In this example, A is the limiting reactant, and the reaction is irreversible, so the concentrations and temperature will become constant when \\(C_A\\) becomes equal to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.2 Parallel Reaction Selectivity in a Cooled BSTR with an Unknown Initial Temperature\nA jacketed, 10 L BSTR is going to be used to process an aqueous solution of A and B. The reactor jacket is perfectly mixed with a volume of 1400 cm3, a heat transfer coefficient of 138 cal ft−2 min−1 K−1 and a heat transfer area of 1200 cm2. Cooling water at 40 °C flows into the jacket at a rate of 100 g min-1. Both the reacting fluid and the cooling water may be taken to have a density of 1 g cm−3 and a heat capacity of 1 cal g−1 K−1.\nSolutions containing A, B, X, Y, and Z are ideal and there is no heat of mixing. The reactor will be charged by mixing two separate solutions, one containing only reagent A and the other containing only reagent B, giving a 10 L charge with initial concentrations of 5 mol A L-1 and 7 mol B L-1. At the time the reactor is charged, the cooling water temperature is 40 °C. Reactions (1) and (2) will occur in the reactor. The heat of reaction (1) is −16.7 kcal mol−1, and that for reaction (2) is −14.3 kcal mol−1. The rate expression for reaction (1) is given in equation (3) where the pre-exponential factor is 9.74 x 109 L mol−1 min−1 and the activation energy is 20.1 kcal mol−1. The rate expression for reaction (2) is given in equation (4) where the pre-exponential factor is 2.38 x 1013 min−1 and the activation energy is 25.3 kcal mol−1.\nWhat initial temperature is needed in order to convert 45% of the A in 30 min, and with that initial temperature what will the final temperature, the outlet exchange fluid temperature, and the selectivity of X to Z equal?\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow X + Y \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_AC_B \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_2 = k_2C_A \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an isolated reactor modeling assignment: the system consists of only a reactor, it’s operation is described, the rate expressions are known and it asks about reactor inputs and outputs. I’ll begin by summarizing the assignment. I’ll use appropriate variable symbols to represent the given constants. For initial values I’ll add a subscripted “0” and for final values a subscripted “f”. I’ll denote the temperature of the cooling water in the jacked as \\(T_{ex}\\). Thus, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) is the initial temperature of the cooling water in the jacket. Unlike the reactants, cooling water flows into the jacket continuously, so I’ll use \\(T_{ex,in}\\) to represent the temperature of the cooling water entering the jacket. I will add the ideal gas constant to the given constants.\n\n\n\n\n9.6.2.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(V\\) = 10 L, \\(V_{ex}\\) = 1.4 L, \\(U\\) = 138 cal ft-2 min-1 K-1, \\(A\\) = 1200 cm2, \\(T_{ex,in}\\) = 40 °C, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) = 100 g min-1, \\(\\rho\\) = 1.0 g cm-3, \\(\\rho_{ex}\\) = 1.0 g cm-3, \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\) = 1.0 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\) = 1.0 cal g-1 K-1, \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 5.0 M, \\(C_{B,0}\\) = 7.0 M, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) = 40 °C, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -16.7 kcal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_2\\) = -14.3 kcal mol-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 9.74 x 109 L mol-1 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 20.1 kcal mol-1, \\(k_{0,2}\\) = 2.38 x 1013 min-1, \\(E_2\\) = 25.3 kcal mol-1, \\(f_{A,f}\\) = 0.45, \\(t_f\\) = 30 min, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Cooled BSTR with a 1-stage operating protocol.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(T_0 : f_A \\big \\vert_{t=tf} = f_{A,f}\\), \\(T_f\\), \\(T_{ex,f}\\), and \\(S_{X/Z,f}\\)\n\n\n9.6.2.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I need to do is generate the reactor design equations for this reactor. Mole balances are always needed, and for a BSTR the mole balance is Equation 6.8. In this system, there are two reactions taking place, so the summation expands to two terms.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j = \\nu_{i,1}r_1V + \\nu_{i,2}r_2V\n\\]\nThe BSTR is not isothermal, so an energy balance on the reacting fluid, Equation 6.9, is required. There are no shafts or moving boundaries (other than the agitator which is assumed to do negligible work), so the rate of doing work, \\(\\dot{W}\\), is zero. The reacting fluid is a liquid, so the pressure is constant and its time-derivative is zero. Assuming it to be an incompressible ideal mixture means that the volume also is constant, and the time-derivative of the volume is equal to zero. The assignment provides a mass-specific heat capacity, so the sensible heat term can be written in terms of that instead of molar heat capacities.

The instant the fluids are mixed in the reactor can be defined as \\(t=0\\). The molar amounts of A, B, X, Y, and Z, the reacting fluid temperature, and the exhhange fluid temperature at that moment are then the initial values. The solutions charged to the reactor did not contain X, Y, or Z, so their initial values are zero. The assignment provides two final values, \\(f_{A,f}\\) and \\(t_f\\).

The design equations are in the form of derivatives expressions, so it is not necessary to modify them.\nI’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables will be known along with the given and known constants.

The initial molar amounts of A and B can be calculated using their given initial concentrations and the reacting fluid volume. The final value, \\(t_f\\), is a given constant. However, the initial value of the temperature is not known and it can’t be calculated directly from the other given constants.\nThe other given final value, \\(f_{A,f}\\), can be used to write an implicit equation for \\(T_0 : f_A \\big \\vert_{t=tf} = f_{A,f}\\) (see Appendix J). The conversion in a closed system is defined by Equation 3.4. Rearranging that equation gives an expression for the final molar amount of A.\n\\[\nn_{A,f} = n_{A,0} \\left( 1 - f_{A,f} \\right)\n\\]\nThe final molar amount of A found by solving the design equations, \\(n_A \\big \\vert_{t=t_f}\\), will only equal \\(n_{A,f}\\) when the design equations are solved using the desired initial temperature, \\(T_0\\). This can be expressed as an implicit equation for \\(T_0\\), and written in the form of a residual expression (see Appendix J).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values\nEquations (17) - (19) can be used to calculate the initial molar amounts. Equation (20) is an implicit equations that can be solved to find the initial value of the temperature.

As described in Appendix J, I’ll similarly need to make the current value of \\(T_0\\) available. As I perform the numerical solutions I’ll need to evaluate the derivatives, calculate the initial and final values, and calculate quantities of interest that aren’t found directly by solving the reactor design equations. One thing to note is that I won’t calculate \\(T_0\\) directly when I’m calculating the other initial and final values.

The initial temperature must be 65 °C for the conversion to equal 45% after 30 min of reaction. At that time, the temperature of the reacting fluid will be 92.4 °C, the exit temperature of the exchange fluid will be 68.2 °C, and the selectivity will equal 4.21 mol X per mol Z.\nSolving the reactor design equations using an initial temperature of 65 °C also yields the final molar amount of \\(n_A\\). One way to check the results is to use that value to calculate the conversion and make sure that it is equal to 45%. Indeed, when the design equations were solved using an initial temperature of 65 °C, the resulting conversion of A was 45%.\nWhen two reactions are taking place, it is quite common for the product of one reaction to be desired and the producs of the other reaction to be undesired. That raises the question, “what can a reaction engineer do to change the selectivity?” There isn’t a single, universal answer to that question. However, an examination of the rate expressions and perhaps a quick qualitative analysis can suggest answers for a given system. Two primary ways to affect selectivity are by altering the compositon of the system or by altering the temperature. Of course, changing either of these parameters will affect all of the reactor outputs.\nConsidering the two reactions in this example, the system has an excess of reagent B. The rate of reaction (1) is proportional to both the concentration of reagent A and the concentration of reagent B. With excess B present, the rate will not decrease as rapidly as it would have otherwise. This improves the selectivity for X over Z. An engineer might perform simulations varying the initial concentration of B to see how it affects the selectivity as well as the conversion and selectivity.\nThe rate expressions show that the activation energy for reaction (2) is greater than that for reaction (1). That means that reaction (2) is more sensitive to temperature than reaction (1). This suggest that another way to increase the selectivity for X over Z would be to lower the temperature. Lowering the temperature will lower both rates, but being more sensitive to temperature, the rate of reaction (2) will be lowered by more than that of reaction (1). As a consequence, while the selectivity should increase, either the conversion will decrease if the reaction time remains 30 min or the reaction time will increase if the conversion remains 45%. Again, simulation can be used to determine the magnitude of the changes. Here, additional simulation shows that if the intitial temperature is reduced to 55 °C, keeping the conversion at 45%, the selectivity will increase to 5.51 mol X per mol Z, but the reaction time will increase to 87.3 min. Given economic data and other operating constraints, an engineer could optimize the performance of this reactor through simulation of this kind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example specified two final values: the reaction time and the fractional conversion. In the solution presented above, the reaction time was used as the stopping criterion when solving the IVODEs and the fractional conversion was used in the implicit equation for the \\(T_0\\).\nThe roles of the reaction time and conversion could have been reversed. The specified conversion could have been used to calculate the corresponding final moles of A, which then could have been used as the stopping criterion. Then the reaction time would have been used in the implicit equation for \\(T_0\\). The results would be the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.3 Maximum Intermediate Yield in Series Reactions\nA BSTR will be charged with 1 atm of A and 2 atm of B at 25 °C.

From these characteristics, I know that this is an isolated reactor modeling assignment. I’ll begin by summarizing the assignment. I’ll use appropriate variable symbols to represent the given quantities and the quantities of interest. A batch reactor is being used, so I’ll use a subscripted “0” to denote initial values and a subscripted “f” to denote final values.

The general BSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.8. I will use this equation to write mole balances for every reagent in the system. That is, I’ll write the mole balance for \\(i\\) = A, B, D, Z, and U. There are two reactions taking place, so the sum will expand to two terms in each mole balance.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j = \\left( \\nu_{i,1}r_1 + \\nu_{i,2}r_2 \\right)V\n\\]\nThis reactor is not isothermal, so I will need to include a BSTR reacting fluid energy balance among the reactor design equations. The BSTR energy balance is given in Equation 6.9. This reactor has rigid walls and no moving boundaries, so it’s volume is constant. If the volume is constant, the time-derivative of the volume is equal to zero. Being a gas phase system with a constant volume, the pressure is expected to change because the temperature will change. Therefore I cannot set the time-derivative of the pressure equal to zero. With no moving boundaries, the only work is that of the agitator, which is assumed to be negligible. The summation over \\(i\\) includes every reagent, and as above, the summation over \\(j\\) expands to two terms.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - V \\cancelto{\\left( r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2\\right)}{\\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left( n_A \\hat C_{p,A} + n_B \\hat C_{p,B} + n_D \\hat C_{p,D} + n_Z \\hat C_{p,Z} + n_U \\hat C_{p,U}  \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  = \\dot Q - \\left( r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2\\right)V\n\\]\nAn exchange fluid is present in this reactor, but the assignment states that its temperature is constant at 30 °C. Knowing the exchange fluid temperature, the other reactor design equations can be solved independently of an energy balance on the exchange fluid, and because the assignment does not ask anything about the exchange fluid, I do not need to include an energy balance on the exchange fluid among the reactor design equations.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances of each of the reagents are presented in equations (5) through (9), and an energy balance on the reacting fluid is presented in equation (10).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -r_1V \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = \\left( -r_1 - r_2 \\right)V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_D}{dt} = \\left( r_1 - r_2 \\right)V \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = \\left( r_1 + r_2 \\right)V \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_U}{dt} = r_2V \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n- V\\frac{dP}{dt} + &\\left( n_A \\hat C_{p,A} + n_B \\hat C_{p,B} + n_D \\hat C_{p,D} + n_Z \\hat C_{p,Z} + n_U \\hat C_{p,U}  \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} \\\\&= \\dot Q  - \\left( r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2\\right)V\n\\end{aligned} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point I have 6 initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs) that contain 7 dependent variables (\\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_D\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(n_U\\), \\(P\\), and \\(T\\)).

The assignment states that the BSTR is charged with only A and B, so the initial molar amounts of D, Z, and U are zero.\nThe final value of the time is the time that maximizes the yield of D from A.

In order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 9.3.\nI’ll start by writing the equations that I’ll need in order to evaluate the derivatives appearing in the reactor design equations. To begin, I need to write the IVODEs in the form of derivative expressions. I’ll use the procedure described in Section J.3.1.\nI’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions. That is, I’ll need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the vector, \\(\\underline{g}\\). Looking at that vector, I see that I will need to calculate \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(\\dot{Q}\\).\nThe rate expressions, equations (3) and (4), can be used to calculate the rates, but those equations introduce the additional variables, \\(P_A\\), \\(P_B\\), and \\(P_D\\). Those partial pressures can be calculated using the ideal gas law.\nThe rate of heat transfer, \\(\\dot{Q}\\), can be calculated using the known heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Solving the Reactor Design Equations\nThe IVODEs, equations (1) through (7) can be written as the matrix equation, (12), with the mass matrix defined as shown in equation (13) and with the vector, \\(\\underline{g}\\), defined as shown in equation (14). The IVODEs can then be written as derivative expressions, equation (15).\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{M}\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} n_A \\\\ n_B \\\\ n_D \\\\ n_Z \\\\ n_U \\\\ T \\\\ P \\end{bmatrix} = \\underline{g}\\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{M} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\displaystyle\\sum_i\\left(n_i \\hat{C}_{p,i} \\right) & -V \\\\ RT & RT & RT & RT & RT & R\\displaystyle\\sum_i n_i & -V  \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\underline{g} = \\begin{bmatrix} -r_1V \\\\ \\left(-r_1 - r_2\\right)V \\\\ \\left(r_1 - r_2\\right)V \\\\ \\left(r_1 + r_2\\right)V \\\\ r_2V \\\\ \\dot{Q} -\\left(r_1\\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2\\right)V \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{dn_A}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{n_B}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{n_D}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{n_Z}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{dn_U}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{T}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{P}{dt} \\end{bmatrix} = \\boldsymbol{M}^{-1} \\underline{g} \\tag{15}\n\\]\nThe rates, \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), can be calculated using equations (3) and (4).

The initial molar amounts of A and B can be calculated from the initial partial pressures, reactor volume, and ideal gas law. The initial total pressure is simply the sum of the initial partial pressures.\nThere are a few different ways to assign a value to \\(t_f\\). I will simply choose a large time. I can then solve the IVODEs for \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_D\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_U\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(P\\left(t\\right)\\). From those results, I can calculate the yield as a function of time, plot it, and identify the time at which it is maximized. If the plot doesn’t have a maximum, I’ll have to solve the design equations again, using a larger value of \\(t_f\\).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values\nThe initial molar amounts of A and B can be calculated using equations (20) and (21), and the initial total pressure can be calculated using equation (22). To facilitate finding \\(t_{opt}\\) as described below, \\(t_f\\) will be varied over a range of values.\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = \\frac{P_{A,0}V}{RT} \\tag{20}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{B,0} = \\frac{P_{B,0}V}{RT} \\tag{21}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_0 = P_{A,0} + P_{B,0} \\tag{22}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, given a value for \\(t_f\\), the BSTR design equations can be solved for \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_D\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_U\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(P\\left(t\\right)\\).

Figure 9.6 shows the variation of the yield as a function of the reaction time. The maximum yield, 0.69 mol D per initial mol A, occurs at a reaction time of 12 min. The conversion of A at that reaction time is 88 %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Yield of D as the reaction time varies.\n\n\n\nReactions (1) and (2) constitute a series-parallel reaction network. The desired product, D, is an intermediate product. It is produced in reaction (1) and consumed in reaction (2). Assuming that the temperature affects the two reactions equally, the yield of an intermediate product is expected to pass through a maximum as the reaction time increases as seen in Figure 9.6. This can be predicted using a quantitative analysis\nQualitative Analysis\nThe reason for the maximum is easy to understand as long as the effect of temperature is comparable for the two reactions. At the start of the reaction, the concentrations of A and B will be large and those of D, U, and Z will be zero. The rate of reaction (1) will be positive while that for reaction (2) will be zero. Consequently, during a very brief interval at the start of the reactive process, the concentrations of A and B will decrease and the concentrations of D and Z will increase.\nDuring the next brief interval in time, the rate of reaction (1) will be smaller because the concentrations of A and B will be smaller, and the rate of reaction (2) no longer will equal zero because a small amount D will be present leading to a positive rate. The concentrations of A and B will again decrease and the concentration of Z will again increase. It can be expected that the rate of reaction (1) will be greater than the rate of reaction (2) because only a small concentration of D will be present, so the concentration of D, and its yield, will again increase, as can be seen in Figure 9.6.\nFor as long as the rate of reaction (2) remains smaller than the rate of reaction (1), the amount of D will be increasing, but its rate of increase will get smaller and smaller. The reason for this is that the concentrations of A and B will be decreasing, and hence the rate of generation of D by reaction (1) will be decreasing. At the same time, the rate of consumption of D by reaction (2) will be increasing as the concentration of D builds. This can be seen in Figure 9.6 where the curvature of the yield plot is initially concave downward,\nEventually, the rate of reaction (2) will become equal to the rate of reaction (1). For that instant in time, the yield of D will not be changing. This corresponds to the maximum in Figure 9.6. At times beyond the maximum the rate of reaction (1) is less than the rate of reaction (2), so the concentration of D decreases. As the concentrations of both reactants, A and D, continue to decrease, both reactions (1) and (2) become slower and slower. This can be seen at larger reaction times in Figure 9.6 where the curve is concave upward. Eventually, at very large reaction time, the rates will equal zero and all of the D will have been consumed.\nIn this example series-parallel reactions are occurring where the desired product is produced in one reaction and consumed by another. In this situation it is often found that the reaction time has the greatest effect upon the amount of the desired product, as was the case here. Other process parameters such as the initial composition or temperature will also affect the results, but for series and series-parallel reactions their effect on the selectivity is often weaker. Temperature can be an effective parameter for adjusting the selectivity of multiple reactions if the activation energies of the reactions differ significantly. That was the case in Example 9.6.3, and indeed, the discussion following the example showed that changing the temperature did have a significant effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the solution above, the mass matrix was used to write the IVODEs in the form of seven derivatives expressions. An equivalent approach is to generate the 7 derivative expressions by algebraic manipulation of equations (5) through (11).\nYet another approach is to solve equation (11) for \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and substitute the result into equation (10). This reduces the IVODEs to a set of six equations containing six dependent variables: \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_D\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(n_U\\), and \\(T\\). Those six IVODEs can then be written as derivative expressions either by algebraic manipulation or using a mass matrix.\nFinally, the numerical implementation described here solved the IVODEs many times using different values of the optimization variable, \\(t_f\\). That approach can be used for any optimization variable, and it must be used when the optimization variables is neither the independent variable nor one of the dependent variables. (For example, if the yield had been optimized with respect to the heat transfer area, the approach used here would have to be used.) However, if the optimization variable is the independent variable or one of the dependent variables, the equations only need to be solved once using a large value of the optimization variable. For example, here the design equations only needed to be solved once using a large value of \\(t_f\\). The yield could then have been calculated as a function of time and the maximum identified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.6.4 Optimization of Net Production Rate\nThe rate expression for liquid-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 2.59 x 109 min-1 and an activation energy of 16.5 kcal mol-1. The heat of reaction (1) may be taken to be constant and equal to -22,200 cal mol-1. A solution containing only A at a concentration of 2 M and a temperature of 23 °C is going to be processed in a BSTR. The heat capacity of the solution is approximately constant and equal to 440 cal L-1 K-1, and its density is constant.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe 4.0 L BSTR has a perfectly mixed jacket with a volume of 0.5 L, a heat transfer area of 0.6 ft2, and a heat transfer coefficient of 1.13 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1. Cooling water at 20 °C can be fed to the jacket. The water may be taken to have a constant density of 1 g cm-3 and a constant heat capacity of 1 cal g-1 K-1. A heating coil with a heat transfer coefficient of 3.8 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1 and a heat transfer area of 0.23 ft2 can be submerged in and extracted from the reacting solution. Saturated steam at 120 °C can admitted to the coil.\nThe BSTR is charged with 4 L of a 2 M solution of A at 23 °C. Initially there is no flow to the jacket, but it is filled with water, also at 23 °C. To start the batch process, the steam is admitted to the coil, and the coil is immersed in the solution. When the reacting fluid reaches 50 °C, the coil is extracted from the reacting fluid and cooling water flow to the jacket is started. When the reacting fluid reaches a temperature of 25 °C the cooling water flow is stopped, the reactor is drained and preparations for processing the next batch begin. The BSTR pressure is constant throughout all stages of processing. If the turnaround time for the reactor is 25 min, what coolant flow rate will maximize the net rate of production of Z? Plot the conversion of A and the reacting fluid temperature vs. reaction time corresponding to the coolant flow rate that maximizes the net rate and comment on the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an isolated reactor analysis problem: the reactor is the only equipment involved, the reactions and rate expressions are knows, and the questions are about reactor inputs and outputs. To summarize the assignment, I’ll assign appropriate variable symbols to every quantity mentioned in the assignment. This is a batch reactor with 2-stage operating protocol. I’ll use a subscripted “0” to denote initial conditions, a subscripted “1” to denote values at the end of the first stage in the protocol and a subscripted “f” to denote final values.\nThis reactor has both a coil for heating and a jacket for cooling. I’ll use a subscripted “ex” to denote properties associated with the cooling jacket and a sub-scripted “coil” to denote properties associated with the heating coil.\n\n\n\n\n9.6.4.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 2.59 x 109 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 16.5 kcal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -22,200 cal mol-1, \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 2 M, \\(T_0\\) = 23 °C, \\(\\breve{C}_p\\) = 440 cal L-1 K-1, \\(V\\) = 4.0 L, \\(V_{ex}\\) = 0.5 L, \\(A_{ex}\\) = 0.6 ft2, \\(U_{ex}\\) = 1.13 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1, \\(T_{ex,in}\\) = 20 °C, \\(\\rho_{ex}\\) = 1 g cm-3, \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\) = 1 cal g-1 K-1, \\(U_{coil}\\) = 3.8 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1, \\(A_{coil}\\) = 0.23 ft2, \\(T_{coil}\\) = 120 °C, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) = 23 °C, \\(T_1\\) = 50 °C, \\(T_f\\) = 25 °C, \\(t_{turn}\\) = 25 min, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1.\nReactor: heated/cooled BSTR with a 2-stage operational protocol.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(\\dot{m}_{ex,opt} = \\underset{\\dot{m}_{ex}}{\\arg\\max} \\left(r_{Z,net}\\right)\\) and \\(f_A\\big\\vert_{\\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}\\left(t\\right)\\) and \\(T\\big\\vert_{\\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}\\left(t\\right)\\) as graphs.\n\n\n9.6.4.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I need to do is to generate the reactor design equations. The operational protocol for this reactor has two stages, so I need to write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model each stage. The reactor design equations always include at least one mole balance. The general BSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.8. I’ll write a mole balance for both of the reagents in this system, noting that the sum reduces to a single term since only one reaction is taking place.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\cancelto{\\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j}\n\\]\nThe BSTR is not isothermal, so I must include an energy balance on the reacting fluid among the design equations. The general BSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.9. Assuming the liquid to be incompressible and the reactor walls to be rigid, both the pressure and volume will be constant, so their time-derivatives will equal zero. The work associated with mixing the reactor can also be assumed to be negligible. There is only one reaction occurring, so the final sum will reduce to a single term. In addition, the assignment provides the volumetric heat capacity of the entire solution, so the sensible heat term can be written in terms of that heat capacity, Equation 6.10. During the first stage of the operating protocol, heat is exchanged with both the cooling water and the steam, so the rate of heat exchange must be split into two terms. During the second stage the coil is not present.\n\\[\n\\cancelto{V \\breve{C}_p}{\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right)} \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dP}{dt}}  - P  \\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\cancelto{\\dot{Q}_{ex} + \\dot{Q}_{coil}}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - V \\cancelto{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\nV \\breve{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{ex} + \\dot{Q}_{coil} - V r_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nThere are two heat exchange fluids in this system. The cooling water in the jacket exchanges sensible heat so the energy balance on it is given by Equation 6.2. During the first stage of the operating protocol, the coolant is not flowing, so \\(\\dot{m}_{ex} = 0\\). During the second stage, the cooling water is flowing. Noting that the heat capacity is constant, the integral is easily evaluated for the second stage.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot{Q}_{ex} - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\nThe steam in the coil exchanges latent heat, so its temperature is known and constant. As a consequence, the mole balances, energy balance on the reacting fluid and energy balance on the cooling water can be solved independently of the energy balance on the steam. The problem does not ask any questions about the steam flow rate or how much of it condenses, so an energy balance on the steam is not needed.\nMomentum balances are not used for stirred tank reactors, so the full set of reactor design equations consists of mole balances on A and Z, an energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the cooling water. The mole balances are the same for both stages of operation, but both energy balances change from one stage to the other. For each stage there are four IVODEs and four dependent variables, so it is not necessary to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on A and Z, equations (3) and (4) are the same in heating stage of the protocol and in the cooling stage. An energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the coolant in the shell during the heating stage are shown in equations (5) and (6). During the cooling stage of the operating protocol, an energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the coolant take the forms shown in equations (7) and (8).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -Vr_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = Vr_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{ex} + \\dot{Q}_{coil}  - Vr_1 \\Delta H_1}{V \\breve C_p} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\left(\\frac{\\dot{Q}_{ex}}{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}}\\right) \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{ex}  - Vr_1 \\Delta H_1}{V \\breve C_p} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\left(\\frac{\\dot{Q}_{ex} + \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde{C}_{p,ex} \\left(T_{ex} - T_{ex,in}\\right)}{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}}\\right) \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BSTR design equations are IVODEs, so initial values and a stopping criterion are needed to solve them.

This marks the start of the heating phase. The molar amounts of A, \\(n_{A,0}\\), and Z, 0.0 (only A is present initially), the reacting fluid temperature, \\(T_0\\), and the cooling water temperature, \\(T_{ex,0}\\), at that time are then the initial values for the analysis of the heating phase. It ends when the reacting fluid reaches \\(T_1\\).\nThe cooling phase begins the instant the heating phase ends, so the initial values for the cooling phase are the final values from the heating phase.

The IVODEs are written in the form of derivative expressions. I’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions.\nExamination of the reactor design equations for this system shows that \\(\\dot{Q}_{coil}\\) needs to be calculated for the first stage, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) needs to be calculated for the second stage, and \\(r_1\\) and \\(\\dot{Q}_{ex}\\) need to be calculated for both stages.\nThe heat exchange rates can be calculated using the known heat transfer coefficients and heat transfer areas, Equation E.4. The reaction rate can be calculated using the given rate expression, but doing so introduces two more variables, \\(k_1\\) and \\(C_A\\). The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, since the pre-expoenetial factor and activation energy are known. The concentration of reagent A can be calculated using the defining equation for concentration in a closed system, Equation 1.7.\nThe coolant flow rate is not known, but it is known that it is the flow rate that results in the maximum net rate of production of Z. There are a few approaches to making use of that information to calculate \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\). I will choose a range of values for \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\), calculate the net rate associated with each coolant flow rate, and plot the resulting data to find the coolant flow rate that maximizes the rate. As such, I will not need to calculate \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) at the time I need to evaluate the derivatives.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\nThe heating coil is only used during the first stage of operation. During that stage the rate of heat exchange with the steam in the coil is given by equation (9). Cooling water is present in the jacket during both phases of operation. The rate of heat exchange between the water in the jacket and the reacting fluid is given by equation (10).\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{coil} = U_{coil} A_{coil} \\left(T_{coil} - T\\right) \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{ex} = U_{ex} A_{ex} \\left(T_{ex} - T\\right) \\tag{10}\n\\]\nThe rate is given by equation (2), where the rate coefficient is found using equation (11) and the concentration of A is found using equation (12).\n\\[\nk_1 = k_{0,1}\\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nThe coolant flow rate, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\), will be varied to find the maximum net rate of production of Z, but at the time the design equations are solved, the value of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) will be known.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to know the initial and final values in Table 9.4 and Table 9.5. The only unknown value for the first stage of processing is the molar amount of A which can be calculated from the known initial concentration and volume. The IVODEs for the first stage of operation will be solved before the IVODEs for the second stage. Consequently, all of the initial and final values for the second stage will be known.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values\nThe initial molar amount of A can be calculated using equation (13).\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = C_{A,0}V \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the design equations for the first stage can be solved to find corresponding sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_Z\\), $T$, and \\(T_{ex}\\) that span the range from their first-stage initial values to their first-stage final values. Then, given a value of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\), the design equations for the second stage can be solved to find corresponding sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_Z\\), $T$, and \\(T_{ex}\\) that span the range from their second-stage initial values to their second-stage final values. Using the final molar amount of Z, the net rate of production of Z can then be calculated from its definition, Equation 4.2. Similarly, using the molar amount of A, the conversion can be calculated at each time using its definition, Equation 3.4. If the calculations are repeated using a range of values of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) that is sufficiently wide that \\(r_{Z,net}\\) passes through a maximum, the maximum net rate and the optimum coolant flow rate can be identified.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Other Quantities of Interest\nWith the information given above, the design equations for the first stage can be solved.

The net rate of production of Z is plotted as a function of the cooling water flow rate in Figure 9.7. The maximum net rate, 0.063 mol min-1, occurs at a coolant flow rate of 183 g min-1. The conversion and reacting fluid temperature profiles at that coolant flow rate are shown in Figure 9.8 and Figure 9.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Net rate of production of Z as cooling water flow rate varies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Conversion profile during processing with the optimum coolant flow rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Temperature profile during processing with the optimum coolant flow rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Instantaneous reaction rate profile during processing with the optimum coolant flow rate.\n\n\n\nKnowing the initial concentration of A and the Arrhenius parameters, the conversion and temperature profiles were used to calculate the instantaneous reaction rate profile shown in Figure 9.10. It shows that the rate effectively zero when the reactant is charged to the BSTR. Figure 9.9 shows the steam heating increases the temperature to 50 °C in ca. 2.5 min, at which time the rate has become significant. The temperature continues to rise because heat is being released by reaction faster than it is being removed by the coolant. As the reactant is depleted, the rate does not increase as rapidly until eventually, after ca. 31.1 min, the rate reaches its maximum value. As the rate decreases, the amount of heat released due to reaction decreases until, at ca. 31.5 min, it becomes equal to the rate at which the coolant is removing heat. At that point the temperature passes through a maximum. After that the coolant removes heat faster than it is generated, and after ca. 100 min the temperature reaches 25 °C and processing ends. The conversion at this point is over 99%.\nIn this assignment, the net rate was maximized with respect to the coolant flow rate. The net rate will also be affected by the duration of the heating stage, or equivalently the temperature at which the coil is removed from the reacting fluid and the coolant flow starts. If the temperatures of the cooling water or the steam could be varied, they, too, would be expected to affect the net rate. In a more realistic optimization, it would not be the net rate that would be optimized. Instead, the rate of financial profit would be maximized. The rate of financial profit would depend on the net rate of the reaction, but it would also depend on the selling price of the product, the costs of the reactant, steam, and cooling water, and a number of other factors. That type of multidimensional optimization is beyond the scope of this book, but at its core, it is similar to the simple optimization illustrated in this assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.",

    "text": "10.1 SBSTR Characteristics\nAs is the case for the other ideal stirred-tank reactors, one essential characteristic of an SBSTR is that the reacting fluid within it is always perfectly mixed. As discussed in Chapter 9 for batch reactors, it is not essential that the reactor takes the form of a stirred tank. Any reactor that is perfectly mixed and that has fluid flowing in or out while reaction is occurring can be modeled as an SBSTR. Nonetheless, in commercial practice SBSTRs most commonly are stirred tanks.\nThe addition and/or removal of heat from the reacting fluid in a stirred tank is described in Appendix E for systems where a separate heat exchange fluid is employed. Chapter 9 describes three geometries involving a perfectly mixed heat exchange fluid: a shell/jacket, an immersed coil, and an external heat exchanger (see Figure 9.1). These three configurations apply equally to SBSTRs. While other means of heat exchange are sometimes used, Reaction Engineering Basics only considers heat exchange between the reacting fluid and a perfectly mixed heat exchange fluid. Mass and energy balances on the exchange fluid for such systems are considered in Chapter 6 and Appendix E.\nThe characteristic that differentiates between a BSTR and an SBSTR is flow of reagents into or out of the reactor while the reaction is taking place. When reagents flow into the reactor during reaction, the SBSTR is sometimes referred to as a “fed-batch” reactor. A common form of semi-batch operation where reacting fluid leaves the reactor involves simple “reactive separation.”",

    "text": "10.1.1 Batch-Fed SBSTRs\nTwo advantages over BSTRs can be realized by adding one reagent to an SBSTR over time. One advantage is control of the rate of heat release. An example is the neutralization of a strong acid using a strong base. Such reactions can have very high rates and be highly exothermic. If all of the reagents are added at once, as in a BSTR, it may not be possible to remove heat fast enough to safely control the temperature. By slowly adding one of the reactants over time, the rate of heat release is limited by the rate of reagent addition and not the rate of reaction. The rate of addition can then be matched to the rate at which heat can be removed. In this way, the temperature can be controlled allowing the reaction to occur safely.\nWhen two or more reactions take place, semi-batch operation with the addition of one reagent can sometimes be used to control selectivity. This happens when the rates of the desired and undesired reactions exhibit different dependence upon the concentrations of the reactants. To illustrate, consider a reaction between reagents A and B. In a BSTR process, the concentrations of A and B would be largest at the start of processing and would remain comparable throughout processing. Suppose instead, that reagent A is present at full concentration at the start of processing, but that reagent B is added to it over time. In this way, the concentration of A can be kept as large as possible while that of B is as low as possible over the course of processing. If the rate of the desired reaction is more favored by high concentration of A and low concentration of B, then semi-batch processing will result in better selectivity than batch processing.\nThe instantaneous selectivity defined in Equation 4.5 can be very useful in identifying situations where an SBSTR might present an advantage over a BSTR. Continuing with the example mentioned in the preceding paragraph, suppose that the desired reaction is first order in both reagents, A and B, and that the undesired reaction is second order in reagent B. In this situation, the instantaneous selectivity is given by Equation 10.1. The rightmost expression for the selectivity clearly shows that high concentration of A and low concentration of B result in higher selectivity for D over U. Example 10.5.2 illustrates this situation.\n\\[\nS_{D/U,inst} = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{D,j}}{\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{U,j}} = \\frac{k_DC_AC_B}{k_UC_B^2} = \\frac{k_D}{k_U} \\frac{C_A}{C_B}\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\n\n\n10.1.2 Reactive Separation SBSTRs\nGenerally the descriptor, “reactive separation,” applies to a wide range of processes wherein reaction and separation occur simultaneously. A number of different types of reactors fall into the category of reactive separation processes. Membrane reactors and reactive distillation columns are reactive separation devices. For present purposes, the term “reactive separation SBSTR” is limited to a two-phase, stirred-tank reactor, for example a reactor where the reacting fluid is boiling and the resulting vapor is removed during processing.\nReactive separation SBSTRs can offer an advantage when a reversible reaction is taking place. Specifically, if one of the products of the reaction is more volatile than the reactants, higher conversion can result in a reactive separation SBSTR than the conversion that would be realized using a BSTR. When using a BSTR, the maximum possible conversion is that where the reaction is becomes equilibrated. When that conversion is reached, the rate equals zero and no further conversion is possible. In contrast, in a reactive separation SBSTR one of the products of the reaction continually boils off and is removed. As a consequence, at a conversion where the BSTR was equilibrated, the SBSTR is not equilibrated because some of the product has been removed. In this way, a reactive separation SBSTR can reach a greater conversion than is possible in a BSTR.\nThe modeling and analysis of reactive separation SBSTRs is not considered in Reaction Engineering Basics. The presence of two phases, and particularly the presence of an interface between the two phases introduces the possibility that neither of the two phases is perfectly mixed. Put differently, it is often found that there are concentration gradients in the fluids near either or both sides of the interface. If such concentration gradients exist, then the fluid is not perfectly mixed, and it is necessary to modify the SBSTR design equations. Reacting multi-phase systems with interfacial gradients are typically studied in more advanced courses on reaction engineering.\n\n\n10.1.3 Other Advantages and Disadvantages of SBSTRs\nBSTRs and SBSTRs are both non-continuous reactors, so in comparison to continuous reactors, they have the same advantages and disadvantages. Their advantages include versatility (using the same reactor at different times to run different reactions) and flexibility such as the ability sequentially vary the processing temperature. Their disadvantages are that their operation is labor intensive and they have lower net rates due to turnaround times. Generally SBSTRs and BSTRs are better suited to production of value added products and not commodity products.\nThree possible advantages of SBSTRs over BSTRs have already been mentioned: controling selectivity or temperature using the rate of reagent addition and increasing conversion in reversible reactions by removal of products. When one of these three effects can be used to advantage, an SBSTR is preferred. Arguably, operation of an SBSTR is slightly more involved than that of a BSTR, so without one of those advantages, a BSTR is likely preferred.",

    "text": "10.2 SBSTR Operation\nThe operation of SBSTRs is very much like that of BSTRs (see Chapter 9), the exception being that during some stages of the operational protocol, reagents are being added to SBSTRs. Operation of SBSTRs includes turnaround time, thereby allowing the definition of a net rate of production of a product like that for BSTRs, Equation 9.1. Very often, processes begin as fed semi-batch processes, but then, when the reactor becomes full, the feed is stopped and they continue as batch processes.\nWhen a reagent is fed to an SBSTR, the feed rate is often a critical factor. In some SBSTR processes, the feed rate controls the rate of reaction. Early in the process it may be essential to maintain a low feed rate, and thereby a low reaction rate, in order to control temperature rise. As the process progresses, the reaction rate will naturally decrease due to consumption of the reagent initially added to the reactor. This suggests that the feed rate could be increased over time. Alternatively, there may be a point at which the reaction rate is sufficiently low that it no longer needs to be limited by the feed rate and the remaining fed reactant can be added all at once. The net rate may be larger if a variable feed rate is used. This presents a variety of ways to optimize net rate, yield, or selectivity in an isolated SBSTR process.",

    "text": "10.3 SBSTR Design Equations\nThe ideal SBSTR design equations are derived in Appendix H and they are discussed in Section 6.4. Energy balances on the heat exchange fluid are discussed in Section 6.3. The SBSTR mole balance, Equation 6.19; SBSTR energy balance, Equation 6.20; exchange fluid sensible heat energy balance, Equation 6.2; and exchange fluid latent heat energy balance, Equation 6.6; are reproduced below.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_i \\left( n_i \\hat C_{p,i}\\right)  \\frac{dT}{dt} -V\\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W - \\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT  - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nAs was the case with BSTRs, it is important to notice that the \\(V\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and \\(P\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) terms in the reacting fluid energy balance will have units of pressure volume time-1. Most of the other terms will have units of energy time-1. This means that a unit conversion is needed. One easy way to do this is to multiply the \\(V\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and \\(P\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) terms by the ideal gas constant in units of energy mol-1 temperature-1 and divide by the ideal gas constant in units of pressure volume mol-1 temperature-1. The moles and temperatures cancel out giving the necessary conversion factor. This works even for a liquid phase system because the ideal gas law is not being used as the equation of state (i. e. to convert from pressure volume to mol temperature). In Reaction Engineering Basics the rate of doing work, \\(\\dot{W}\\) is almost always negligible. However, if it is non-zero, it will likely have units of power (e. g. hp) or pressure volume time-1, and again a unit conversion is needed.\n\n\n\nCommon simplifications of the SBSTR design equations were presented in Chapter 6. For convenience, they are summarized below. The sensible heat terms in the mole and energy balances above are written in terms of molar heat capacities. They can also be written in terms of the volumetric or gravimetric heat capacity of the reactiong fluid as a whole.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\tilde C_pdT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\breve C_pdT\n\\]\nWhen the reacting fluid is an ideal gas, the reacting fluid volume, \\(V\\), is constant (assuming rigid reactor walls), and its time derivative is equal to zero. For an incompressible ideal liquid reacting fluid the time derivative of the reacting fluid volume is equal to the volumetric feed rate, and if the feed rate is constant, that expression can be integrated to get an expression for the reacting fluid volume.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot V_{in}\n\\]\n\\[\nV = V_0 + \\dot V_{in}t\n\\]\nWhen heat is added or removed using a heat exchange fluid, the rate of heat removal can be expressed in terms of the heat transfer coefficient and area. When rate expressions are substituted into the mole and energy balances, they may introduce concentration or, for gases, partial pressures. The instantaneous values of those composition variables are found using their defining equations. It is important to recognize that unlike a BSTR, the fluid volume in the defining equation for concentration will be changing during the time when feed is being added.\n\\[\n\\dot Q = UA\\left( T_{ex} - T \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{n_i}{V}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{n_iRT}{V}\n\\]",

    "section": "10.4 General Approach to Modeling SBSTRs",
    "text": "10.4 General Approach to Modeling SBSTRs\nThe analysis of SBSTRs is very similar to the analysis of BSTRs which is described in Chapter 9. After identifying the assigment as one involving the analysis of an isolated ideal SBSTR, Chapter 8, the analysis can be completed in four general steps (Chapter 7): summarize the information provided, formulate the solution mathematically, implement the solution numerically, and present and discuss the results.\nSummarizing an SBSTR analysis assignment is essentially the same as summarizing a BSTR analysis assignment. As with BSTRs, the summary should indicate the number of stages in the operating protocol. If the reactor operates as an SBSTR in some stages and as a BSTR in others, that information should be included in the summary.\nThe mathematical formulation will always entail selecting the reactor design equations needed to model each stage of the operating protocol and simplifying them as appropriate for the specific reactor being analyzed. When analyzing an SBSTR, the reactor design equations will always be IVODEs with elapsed time as the independent variable. Because the reactor design equations are IVODEs, the mathematical formulation should also specify the initial values and stopping criterion for each stage of the operational protocol.\nIt is possible that the number of SBSTR design equations will be one less than the number of dependent variables appearing in them. The reason for this is that the reacting fluid energy balance introduces three dependent variables. Assuming the reactor walls to be rigid, for a gas-phase reacting fluid, \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) will equal zero, but both \\(\\frac{dT}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) will be non-zero. This same situation was encountered with BSTRs, and it is handled in the same way when modeling SBSTRs. A differential form of the ideal gas law, Equation 6.11 and below, is used. It is either added to the SBSTR design equations or it is solved for \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and substituted into the energy balance. Either approach results in the number of IVODEs being equal to the number of dependent variables appearing in them.\n\\[\nRT\\left( \\sum_i \\frac{dn_i}{dt} \\right) + R\\left( \\sum_i n_i \\right)\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\n\\]\nWhen modeling liquid phase reactions in BSTRs, the number of design equations was always equal to the number of dependent variables because for liquids both \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) are equal to zero for an incompressible ideal liquid reacting in a reactor with solid walls. This is not true when processing a liquid in an SBSTR. When processing a liquid, \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) will equal zero, but the volume will be changing as described above. In this situation Equation 6.23 is added to the IVODEs or used to eliminate \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) from the reacting fluid energy balance.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot V_{in}\n\\]\nThe remainder of the mathematical formulation is analogous to BSTRs. It involves writing the ancillary equations that are needed in order to evaluate the derivatives at the start of a numerical integration step (i. e. knowing the values of the independent and dependent variables), writing the ancillary equations needed to calculate the initial and final values, and writing the ancillary equations needed to calculated any other quantities of interest once the design equations have been solved. It concludes with concise instructions on how to use the equations to calculate initial and final values, to evaluate the derivatives, and to calculate additional quantities of interest.\nNumerical implementation involves writing computer code that follows the instructions at the end of the mathematical formulation. Presentation and discussion of the results is straightforward.",

    "text": "10.5 Examples\nAll of the examples presented here involve liquid phase reacting systems. Examples 10.5.1 and 10.5.2 involve response tasks, while Example 10.5.3 entails optimization. Examples 10.5.1 and 10.5.3 illustrate the use of an SBSTR to control the rate of heat release from a rapid, exothermic reaction. Example -Section 10.5.2 shows how the use of an SGSTR can influence selectivity.\n\n10.5.1 Response of an SBSTR During Acid Neutralization\nA strong acid (15 M) at 20 °C is going to be neutralized using a strong base, B (15 M NaOH), also at 20 °C, equation (1). If the acid and the base were simply mixed together, they would react violenly, releasing enough energy to raise their temperature to over 225 °C. Instead, a 10 L SBSTR will be used to neutralize 5.0 L of the acid. The acid will initially be present in the reactor, and the base will be added a rate of 0.25 L min-1 until 5 L of the base have been added. The reacting fluid will exchange heat with 2.5 L cooling water in a perfectly mixed shell. Chilled water at 20 °C will enter the shell at a rate of 2.5 L min-1. The heat transfer area is 2150 cm2 and the heat transfer coefficient is 73 cal cm-2 h-1 K-1. At the time the acid is charged to the reactor, the cooling water temperature within the heat exchanger is 20 °C. The density and heat capacity of the acid solution, base solution, and cooling water can all be taken to be those of water, 1 g cm-3 and 1 cal g-1 K-1. The neutralization reaction, equation (1), is irreversible with a heat of reaction equal to -13.7 kcal mol-1. The reaction is first order in both acid and base with a pre-exponential factor of 8.11 x 1012 L mol-1 s-1 and an activation energy of 17.7 kcal mol-1. equation (2). The pressure in the reactor will be constant and equal to 1 atm. Plot the acid concentration and the reactor temperature as functions of time while the base is being added.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow S + W \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_AC_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assignment describes an SBSTR and its operation. There isn’t any other equipment in the system, so this is an isolated ideal reactor modeling assignment. When I summarize the information in the assignment narrative I will use appropriate variable symbols for each quantity. I will use a subscripted “0” to denote values at the start of the process, a subsctipted “f” to denote values at the end of the process, and a subscripted “in” to denote values entering the reactor or jacket. I will assume that the cooling water in the jacket is at 20 °C before the process begins.\nThe quantities of interest are concentration and temperature during the first stage of the operating protocol, so only that stage needs to be analyzed.\n\n\n\n\n10.5.1.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 15 M, \\(T_0\\) = = 20 °C, \\(C_{15,in}\\) = 2 M, \\(T_{in}\\) = 20 °C, \\(V_0\\) = 5 L, \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) = 0.25 L min-1, \\(V_B\\) = 5 L, \\(V_{ex}\\) = 2.5 L, \\(T_{ex,in}\\) = 20 °C, \\(\\dot{V}_{ex}\\) = 2.5 L min-1, \\(A\\) = 2150 cm2, \\(U\\) = 73 cal cm-2 h-1 K-1, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) = 20 °C, \\(\\rho\\) = 1 g cm-3, \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\) = 1 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -13.7 kcal mol-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 8.11 x 1012 L mol-1 s-1, \\(E_1\\) = 17.7 kcal mol-1, \\(P\\) = 1 atm, \\(M_B\\) = 40 g mol-1, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1 = 0.08206 L atm mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: cooled SBSTR with a one-stage operational protocol.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(C_A\\left(t\\right)\\) and \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\) as graphs.\n\n\n10.5.1.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nReactor design equations are needed to model a reactor, and mole balances must always be included among the design equations. I will simply write an SBSTR mole balance, Equation 6.19, for each of the reagents, A, B, S, and W. Only one reaction is taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term, and only reagent B flows into the reactor, so \\(\\dot n_{A,in}\\) = \\(\\dot n_{S,in}\\) = \\(\\dot n_{W,in}\\) = 0.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\Rightarrow \\dot n_{i,in} + \\nu_{i,1} V r_1\n\\]\nThe reactor is not isothermal, so an energy balance on the reaction fluid, Equation 6.20, must also be included among the reactor design equations. The assignment narrative provides the gravimetric heat capacity of the reacting fluid, so that can be used in the first term in place of the summation over the molar heat capacities. The reacting fluid is an ideal liquid, so the pressure is constant and its time deriviative is equal to zero. Liquid is being added to the reactor, so the reacting fluid volume is not constant and its derivative is not equal to zero. There are no shafts or moving boundaries (other than, perhaps, an agitator), so the rate of doing work is zero. The term for the sensible heat gained by the B that is fed to the reactor is expressed in terms of its molar flow rate and heat capacity. This term can be re-written in terms of the mass flow rate and heat capacity, and noting that the heat capacity is constant, it can be taken outside of the integral which then can be evaluated. Finally, there is only one reaction taking place so the final sum reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\cancelto{\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p}{\\sum_i \\left( n_i \\hat C_{p,i}\\right)}  \\frac{dT}{dt} &- \\cancelto{0}{V\\frac{dP}{dt}} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} \\\\&- \\cancelto{\\dot{m}_{B,in}\\tilde{C}_p \\left(T - T_{in}\\right)}{\\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT}  - \\cancelto{Vr_1 \\Delta H_1}{V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot{m}_{B,in} \\tilde{C}_p\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)  - V r_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nThe reactor is cooled using a heat exchange fluid that gains sensible heat, so an energy balance on that exchange fluid, Equation 6.2 is also needed. Again, because the heat capacity is constant it can be taken outside of the integral, and the integral can be evaluated. The equation can then be written in the form of a derivative expression.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex} \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = \\frac{-\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex} \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right)}{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, S and W are presented in equations (3) - (6). The energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (7), and an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid is shown in equation (8).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = - V r_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = \\dot n_{B,in} - V r_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_S}{dt} =  V r_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_W}{dt} =  V r_1 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot{m}_{B,in} \\tilde{C}_p\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)  - V r_1 \\Delta H_1 \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = \\frac{-\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_p \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right)}{\\rho V_{ex} \\tilde C_p} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations are IVODEs. There are six equations, and they include seven dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(T\\), \\(V\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\). I need to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable. This is a liquid-phase system with liquid being added. Assuming the liquid to be an incompressible ideal solution, the rate of change of the volume will equal the volumetric flow rate, yielding a seventh IVODE. I can either add that equation to the design equations or I can use it to eliminate \\(V\\) as a dependent variable.\nWhen I solve the IVODEs I will need to have them in the form of derivative expressions (see Appendix J). Equations (3) through (7) and equation (9) are in that form, but equation (8) is not. However, if I substitute equation (9) for $ in equation (8), I will have six IVODEs with six dependent variables.\n\n\n\nThe liquids are ideal and incompressible, so the change in the reacting fluid volume is simply equal to the volumetric flow rate, equation (9). Substitution of equation (9) for \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) in equation (7) and rearrangement converts it to the form of a derivative expression, equation (10), and results in a set of six reactor design equations (3) - (6), (8), and (10), with six dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\).\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot{V}_{in}\\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot Q - \\dot{m}_{B,in} \\tilde{C}_p\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)  - V r_1 \\Delta H_1 + P\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\rho V \\tilde{C}_p} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is the elapsed time, \\(t\\). I can define \\(t=0\\) as the instant the flow of B into the reactor begins. The initial values are then simply the values of the dependent variables at that time. At that instant, only reagent A is present in the system, so the initial values of the molar amounts of B, S, and W are zero.\nThe quantities of interest are the concentration of A and the temperature during the period when B is being added to the reactor. When 20 L of the base solution have been added, the feed must stop. Unfortunately, I can’t use the volume of base solution as the stopping criterion because it isn’t one of the independent or dependent variables. Instead, I’ll just use the final time, \\(t_f\\), as the stopping criterion.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (3) - (6), (8), and (10).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_f\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_S\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_W\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T_{ex}\\)\n\\(T_{ex,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 10.1.\nFirst I’ll write the ancillary equations I need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables (\\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\)) will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions. Examining equations (3) - (6), (8), and (10), I see that the unknown quantities \\(V\\), \\(r_1\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\), \\(\\dot{m}_{B,in}\\), and \\(\\dot{Q}\\) are present in the IVODEs and need to be calculated.\n\\(V\\) is the instantaneous volume of the reacting fluid, not the total capacity of the reactor. Noting that the inlet flow rate is constant, equation (9) can be integrated to get an expression for the instantaneous volume during the time that fluid is flowing into the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot{V}_{in} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\int_{V_0}^V dV = \\dot{V}_{in} \\int_{0}^t dt\n\\]\n\\[\nV = \\dot{V}_{in} t + V_0\n\\]\nThe rate is given by equation (2), but that introduces the rate coefficient and the concentrations of A and B. These can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, and the defining equation for concentration, Equation 1.7. Similarly, the inlet molar flow rate can be calculated from the known inlet volumetric flow rate and concentration using Equation 1.15. The base is NaOH, so the mass flow rate can be calculated from the molar flow rate and the molecular weight. Finally the rate of heat exchange can be calculated using the known heat transfer coefficient and area.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\nAssuming the reacting fluid to be an ideal liquid and noting that the inlet volumetric flow rate is constant, the instantaneous reacting fluid volume is given by equation (11). The rate, \\(r_1\\), appearing in the design equations can be calculated using the rate expression, equation (2). The rate coefficient and concentrations that appear in the rate expression can be calculated using equations (12), (13), and (14). Equation (15) gives the inlet molar flow rate of reagent B, and noting that reagent B is NaOH, its mass flow rate can be calculated using equation (16). Finally the rate of heat transfer is related to the heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area, equation (17).\n\\[\nV = \\dot{V}_{in} t + V_0 \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nk_1 = k_{0,1}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_1}{RT}\\right)} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_B = \\frac{n_B}{V} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{B,in} = \\dot{V}_{in} C_{B,in} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{B,in} = \\dot{n}_{B,in}M_{NaOH} \\tag{16}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q} = UA\\left(T - T_{ex} \\right) \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to know the initial and final values in Table 10.1. I defined \\(t_0\\) to equal 0. The initial moles of B, S, and W are zero, and \\(T_0\\), \\(T_{ex,0}\\), and \\(V\\) are known. The initial molar amount of A can be calculated from the known initial reacting fluid volume and the initial concentration of A. The final time can be calculated from the knowledge that 5 L of base will be added at a constant rate of 0.25 L min-1.\n\\[\nt_f = \\frac{V_B}{\\dot{V}_{in}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = C_{A,0}V_0 \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nt_f = \\frac{V_B}{\\dot{V}_{in}} \\tag{19}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the reactor design equations can be solved. Since they are IVODEs, doing so will yield corresponding sets of corresponding values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\) spanning the range from their initial values to the point where the reactor becomes full.

The heat exchanger would not be able to remove that heat rapicly enough to keep the temperature under control. Figure 10.3 shows that by operating as an SBSTR and adding the base slowly over time, the temperature can be safely controlled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nAn external heat exchanger like that depeicted in Figure 9.1 (c) is used to cool the reactor. If the reactor had a jacket through which the cooling water circulated, the heat transfer area might change as the base was added. Initially the reactor would be approximately half full. If the jacket was the full height of the reactor, that would mean that the reacting fluid was only contacting half of the heat transfer area at the start of the reaction. This would reduce the rate of heat removal by half at the start of the process, leading to a larger temperature increase. As the reactor filled, the reactor would contact a larger and larger fraction of the heat transfer area. Only when the reactor became full, would the reacting fluid contact the entire heat transfer area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Yield in an SBSTR\nThe rate expressions for reactions (1) and (2) are shown in equations (3) and (4).

If the total reaction time is always 8 h, compare the overall conversion of B, the selectivity for D over U (final moles of D per final moles of U), and the yield of D from B (final moles of D per total moles of B added to the reactor) if the solution of B is added over the first 1, 3, 5, or 7 hours of operation.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow D \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 B \\rightarrow U \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_AC_B \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_2 = k_2C_B^2 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves the analysis of an isolated SBSTR.

Mole balances are always included in the design equations. I’ll write a mole banance for each of the four reagents. The general SBSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.19. Two reactions take place in this system, so the summation expands to two terms. The inlet molar flow rates of A, D, and U are all equal to zero. The only difference when there is a second phase of operation is that the inlet molar flow rate of reagent B is also equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\Rightarrow \\dot n_{i,in} + \\nu_{i,1} V r_1 + \\nu_{i,2} V r_2\n\\]\nThe reactor is not isothermal, so the mole balances cannot be solved independently of an energy balance. The general energy balance for an SBSTR is given in Equation 6.20. The narrative provides a volumetric heat capacity that applies to solutions of A and B. Presumably this heat capacity is essentially equal to that of the solvent, so it can be used for both the reacting fluid and the feed stream, replacing the summations over molar heat capacities. The heat capacity is constant, so it can be taken outside of the integral, and the resulting trivial integral can be evaluated. The reactor is adiabatic, so \\(\\dot{Q}\\) is equal to zero and apart from agitation, no work is being done so \\(\\dot{W}\\) is neglibible. The reacting fluid is a liquid, so the pressure is constant and its time derivative is zero. Finally, two reactions are taking place, so the final summation expands to two terms. The only differences when there is a second phase of operation is that the \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) term and the inlet volumetric flow rate are equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\cancelto{V \\breve{C}_p}{\\sum_i \\left( n_i \\hat C_{p,i}\\right)}  \\frac{dT}{dt} &-V\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dP}{dt}} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} \\\\&- \\cancelto{\\dot{V}_{in} \\breve{C}_p \\left( T - T_{in} \\right)}{\\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT}  - V\\cancelto{\\left(r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2\\right)}{\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nBeing an adiabatic reactor, there isn’t an exchange fluid, so an exchange fluid energy balance is not needed.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for reagents A, B, D, and U are presented in equations (5) through (8). In the second stage of BSTR operation, the only change is that \\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\) is equal to zero. The energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (9). In the second stage of BSTR operation, the only change is that the first term on the right side of the equals sign is becomes zero.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -r_1V \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = \\dot{n}_{B,in} -\\left(r_1 + 2 r_2\\right)V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_D}{dt} = r_1V \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_U}{dt} = r_2V \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nV \\breve{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\dot{V}_{in}\\breve{C}_p \\left(T - T_{in} \\right)  - r_1V \\Delta H_1 - r_2V \\Delta H_2 \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five IVODEs and six dependent variables, which means either an IVODE must be added or one of the dependent variables must be eliminated. Assuming the reacting fluid to be an ideal, incompressible solution, the instantaneous rate of change of the volume will equal the inlet volumetric flow rate. This can be used to eliminate \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) from the energy balance.\n\n\n\nAssuming the reacting fluid to be an ideal, incompressible solution, the instantaneous rate of change of the volume will equal the inlet volumetric flow rate, equation (10). Substitution into equation (9) and rearranging yields equation (11). Equations (5), (6), (7), (8), and (11) are a set of five IVODEs with five dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_D\\), \\(n_U\\), and \\(T\\).\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot{V}_{in} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{-\\dot{V}_{in}\\breve{C}_p \\left(T - T_{in} \\right)  - r_1V \\Delta H_1 - r_2V \\Delta H_2 + P \\dot{V}_{in}}{V \\breve{C}_p} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations are IVODEs, with two stages of operation. I can define \\(t=0\\) to be the time when the flow of reagent B into the reactor begins. At that time only reagent A is present in the reactor. The first stage of operation ends when the flow of reagent B ends at \\(t_{add}\\).\nThe second stage begins immediately. Consequently the initial values are equal to the final values from the first stage. I will use a subscript “sb,f” to denote values at the end of the semi-batch stage of operation. The second stage ends after 8 h of operation.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (5) - (8) and (11) for the first stage of the operating protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{add}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_D\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_U\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.3: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (5) - (8) and (11) for the second stage of the operating protocol (i. e. if \\(t_{add} &lt; t_f\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t_{add}\\)\n\\(t_f\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,sb,f}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(n_{B,sb,f}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_D\\)\n\\(n_{D,sb,f}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_U\\)\n\\(n_{U,sb,f}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_{sb,f}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 10.2 and Table 10.3.\nI’ll start by writing the ancillary equations that I’ll need in order to evaluate the derivatives appearing in the reactor design equations. The design equations already take the form of derivative expressions (see Appendix J) so they do not need to be rearranged.\nI’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables (\\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_D\\), \\(n_U\\), and \\(T\\)) will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions.\nLoodking at the design equations I see that they contain the following unknown quantities: \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\), \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\), and \\(V\\) (\\(V\\) is the instantaneous volume of the reacting fluid, not the total capacity of the reactor). The rates can be calculated using the rate expressions provided in the assignment, but that introduces the rate coefficients and concentrations of A and B. The Arrhenius expression can be used to calculate the rate coefficients and the defining equations for concentration can be used to calculate the concentations.\nNoting that the inlet flow rate is constant, equation (10) can be integrated to get an expression for the instantaneous volume during the time that fluid is flowing into the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot{V}_{in} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\int_{V_0}^V dV = \\dot{V}_{in} \\int_{0}^t dt\n\\]\nThe inlet volumetric flow rate is constant, so it can be calculated by simply divining the volume of B to be added by the time over which it is added. The inlet molar flow rate of B is then just the inlet volumetric vlow rate times the concentration of B in the fluid being added.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\nThe instantaneous volumetric flow rate and reacting fluid volume appearing in the design equations can be calculated using equations (12) and (13). The rates, \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\), are given by equations (3) and (4). The rate coefficients in those expressions can be calculated using equations (14) and (15), and the concentrations can be calculated using equations (16) and (17).

The assignment asks for the final yield of D from B and the final conversion of B. The former can be calculated using its defining equation. Normally the conversion is calculated as the fraction of the initial amount of a reactant that has been converted. Here, the initial amount of B is zero, so that definition won’t work.

The conversion of B decreases as its addition gets spread over longer times. This is reasonable because the later in the process that the B is added, the less time it has to react. Separate calculations show that if the reaction is run in a batch reactor the conversion is 85.7 % with a selectivity for D over U of 2.88 and a yield of D from B of 50.6 %.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.4: Effect of addition time upon the conversion of B and the yield of D from B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition Time (h)\nConversion of B (%)\nSelectivity for D over U\nYield of D from B (%)\n\n\n\n\n1\n84.4\n3.18\n51.5\n\n\n3\n80.8\n3.77\n52.4\n\n\n5\n75.5\n4.4\n51.7\n\n\n7\n68\n5.35\n49.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the B to A over time keeps the concentration of A as large as possible at all times and keeps the concentration of B lower than if it was all added at the start. The expression for the instantaneous selectivity for D over U for these reactions, Equation 10.1 and reproduced below, suggests that this should result in greater selectivity, and indeed, Table 10.4 shows that the slower the B is added (i. e. the longer the time during which it is added), the greater the selectivity for D over U.\n\\[\nS_{D/U,inst} = \\frac{k_D}{k_U} \\frac{C_A}{C_B}\n\\]\nWhile the selectivity is increasing, the conversion of B is decreasing. As a consequence, the yield of D from B is nearly constant at approximately 50%, passing through a weak maximum when B is added over 3 h. The processing time in all cases is the same, 8 h. Hence, the operating costs, are basically the same. The net rate of production of D is essentially the same, too, because the yield of D is effectively constant.\nIn effect, the same amount of B is converted to D in all four cases, but as the addition time increases, the amount of B converted to U decreases while the amount of unreacted B increases. Comparing batch processing to semi-batch processing where the B is added during the first 7 h of the 8 h process, the same amount of D is produced at the same net rate. The difference is that in semi-batch mode there is more unreacted B while in batch mode there is more undesired U.\nSemi-batch processing where the B is added during the first 7 h of the 8 h process has an advantage of batch processing in two scenarios. First, if reagent B is easily and inexpensively separable from the product mixture, not converting it to U, but instead recovering it and re-using it in a subsequent semi-batch run mitigates the low conversion.\nThe other scenario is when U is a valueless hazardous waste. The disposal of such a waste can add significantly to the cost of the process, thereby decreasing profits. In this scenario, even if the unconverted B cannot be separated and re-used, the cost of wasting reagent B (i. e. low conversion) can be more than offset by significantly lower expenses associated with disposal of U (because less U is generated).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.3 Maximizing the Net Rate in an SBSTR\nThe hydrolysis of acetic anhydride, reaction (1), can run away thermally in a batch reactor, but this can be prevented using semi-batch operation. Suppose the rate can be described using the rate expression shown in equation (2) where the reaction is first order in acetic anhydride with a pre-exponential factor of 1.192 x 1015 min-1 and an activation energy of 97,600 J mol-1. The heat of reaction may be taken to be constant and equal to -58,615 J mol-1.\nThe reacting fluid is cooled by water that is fed to the perfectly mixed, 300 cm3 reactor jacket at 60 °C and 250 cm3 min-1. The product of the heat transfer area and the heat transfer coefficient, \\(UA\\), equals 260 cal min-1 K-1.\nThe reactor operates at atmospheric pressure and initially contains an ideal liquid mixture of 67 cm3 of water, 283 cm3 of acetic acid (the solvent and product) and 0.30 cm3 of sulfuric acid at 60 °C. Initially the temperature of the water in the jacket is 60 C, too. The heat capacity of the fluid in the reactor may be taken to be constant and equal to 2.68 J cm-3 K-1. A total of 350 cm3 of acetic anhydride at 21 °C needs to be processed. To do so, it will be fed to the reactor at a constant volumetric flow rate until all of it has been added, after which the reactor will operate in batch mode until the reacting fluid cools to 65 °C. At no time during processing can the reacting fluid temperature exceed 95 °C. What volumetric feed rate will minimize the processing time, and at that feed rate what will the final conversion of A equal? Plot (a) the temperature of the fluid in the reactor and (b) the concentration of acetic anhydride in the reactor as a function of processing time when that feed rate is used.\nYou may assume the liquid mixture to be ideal, and that the densities of acetic anhydride, acetic acid, and water are constant and equal to 1.082, 1.0, and 1.049 g cm-3, respectively. Their molecular weights are 102, 18, and 60 g mol-1, respectively, and the heat capacity of acetic anhydride being added to the reactor can be taken to be 168.2 J mol-1 K-1.\n\\[\n\\left(CH_3CO\\right)_2O + H_2O \\rightarrow 2 CH_3CO_2H \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_{\\left(CH_3CO\\right)_2O} \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis problem is loosely based upon the work of Haldar and Rao (1992a, 1992b), but the rate expression was modified and additional assumptions regarding fluid and reactor properties were introduced. This was done to avoid intricate details from obscuring the basic approach to the analysis of a semi-batch reactor. Therefore, the results presented here should not be used for engineering purposes, but rather the original work should be consulted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment requires the analysis of an isolated reactor with a two-stage operational protocol. During the first stage it operates as an SBSTR. The first stage ends when all of the acetic anhydride has been added. During the second stage the reactor operates as a BSTR.\nI will begin by summarizing the information provided in the assighment narrative. To simplify the notation I well let A represent acetic anhydride, W represent water, and Z represent acetic acid. With this notation, the reaction is \\(A+W\\rightarrow 2Z\\). I will use a subscripted “0” to denote initial values, “sb” to denote values at the end of semi-batch processing (stage 1), “f” to denote final values (at the end of stage 2), and “in” to denote inlet values.\n\n\n\n\n10.5.3.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 1.192 x 1015 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 97,600 J mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -58,615 J mol-1, \\(V_{ex}\\) = 300 cm3, \\(T_{ex,in}\\) = 60 °C, \\(\\dot{V}_{ex,in}\\) = 250 cm3 min-1 \\(UA\\) = 260 cal min-1 K-1, \\(P\\) = 1 atm, \\(V_{W,0}\\) = 67 cm3 \\(V_{Z,0}\\) = 283 cm3, \\(V_{H_2SO_4,0}\\) = 0.30 cm3, \\(T_0\\) = 60 °C, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) = 60 °C, \\(\\breve{C}_p\\) = 2.68 J cm-3 K-1, \\(V_A\\) = 350 cm3, \\(T_{in}\\) = 21 °C, \\(T_f\\) = 65 °C, \\(T_{max}\\) = 95 °C, \\(\\rho_A\\) = 1.082 g cm-3, \\(\\rho_W\\) = 1.0 g cm-3, \\(\\rho_Z\\) = 1.049 g cm-3, \\(M_A\\) = 102 g mol-1, \\(M_W\\) = 18 g mol-1, \\(M_Z\\) = 60 g mol-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\) = 168.2 J mol-1 K-1, \\(\\rho_{ex}\\) = 1.0 g cm-3, and \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\) = 1 cal g-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Cooled stirred tank with a 2-stage operating protocol where the reactor is an SBSTR during the first stage and a BSTR during the second stage.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(\\dot{V}_{opt} = \\underset{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\arg\\min}\\left( t_f \\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\big\\vert_{\\dot{V}_{in} = \\dot{V}_{opt}}\\) (as a graph), and \\(C_A\\left(t\\right)\\big\\vert_{\\dot{V}_{in} = \\dot{V}_{opt}}\\) (as a graph).\n\n\n10.5.3.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment requires the modeling of an isolated SBSTR/BSTR, so I need to generate the reactor design equations for it. Mole balances are always needed when modeling a reactor. The general SBSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.19. Only one reaction is taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term, and only reagent A flows into the reactor, so \\(\\dot n_{W,in}\\) = \\(\\dot n_{Z,in}\\) = 0. I won’t write a mole balance for the acid since it does not react, and its molar amount is constant. The only difference in the second stage is that the flow a A into the reactor is also equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\Rightarrow \\dot n_{i,in} + \\nu_{i,1} V r_1\n\\]\nThe reactor is not isothermal, so an energy balance on the reacting fluid, Equation 6.20, must also be included among the reactor design equations. I am given the volumetric heat capacity of the reacting fluid, so I can replace the summation over the molar heat capacities in the first term. The reacting fluid is a liquid, so the pressure is constant and its time derivative is equal to zero. The only reagent flowing into the reactor during operation as an SBSTR is A, so the first summation on the right-hand side of the equation reduces to a single term. Additionally, the heat capacity of A is a constant so it can be taken outside of the integral and the integral can be evaluated. Finally, only one reaction is taking place, so the sum over the reactions reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\cancelto{V \\breve{C}_p}{\\sum_i \\left( n_i \\hat C_{p,i}\\right)}  \\frac{dT}{dt} &- \\cancelto{0}{V\\frac{dP}{dt}} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} \\\\&- \\cancelto{\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\hat{C}_{p,A} \\left(T - T_{in}\\right)}{\\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT}  - V\\cancelto{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\nV \\breve{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot{n}_{A,in} \\hat{C}_{p,A}\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)  - V r_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nThe reactor is cooled using water that gains sensible heat, so an energy balance on the exchange fluid, Equation 6.2, is also needed. Again, because the heat capacity is constant it can be taken outside of the integral and the integral can be evaluated. Dividing both sides of this equation by \\(\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\) will convert it to the form of a derivative expression.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex} \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, W, and Z are presented in equations (3), (4), and (5). The energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (6). In the second stage of operation, \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\) in equations (3) and (6) is equal to zero, as is the \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) term. An energy balance on the heat exchange fluid is shown in equation (7).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \\dot n_{A,in} - V r_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_W}{dt} = - V r_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = V r_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nV \\breve{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot{n}_{A,in} \\hat{C}_{p,A}\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)  - V r_1 \\Delta H_1 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = \\frac{-\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex} \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right)}{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations are IVODEs. There are five of them, but they contain six dependent variables. Therefore, I need to either add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable. Assuming the reacting fluid to be an ideal, incompressible solution, the instantaneous rate of change of the volume will equal the inlet volumetric flow rate. This can be used to eliminate \\(\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) from the energy balance.\n\n\n\nAssuming the reacting fluid to be an ideal, incompressible solution, the instantaneous rate of change of the volume will equal the inlet volumetric flow rate, equation (8). Substitution into equation (6) and rearranging yields equation (9). Equations (3), (4), (5), (7), and (9) are a set of five IVODEs with five dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\). In the second stage, \\(\\dot{n}{A,in}\\) and \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) are equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot{V}_{in} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot Q - \\dot{n}_{A,in} \\hat{C}_{p,A}\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)  - V r_1 \\Delta H_1 + P\\dot{V}_{in}}{V \\breve{C}_p} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations are IVODEs, so initial values and a stopping criterion are needed to solve them. I can define \\(t=0\\) to be the instant that acetic anhydride begins to flow into the reactor. The initial values are the values of the dependent variables at that time. Here, there isn’t any A present, so it’s initial value is zero. The first stage of operation ends when all of the A has been added to the reactor. I can designate that as \\(t_{sb}\\).\nIf the conversion of A at the end of semi-batch processing is less than 99%, there will be a second, BSTR stage. The second stage of operation begins immediately, so the initial values for the second stage are simply equal to the final values from the first stage. The second stage ends when the temperature reaches \\(T_f\\).\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 10.5: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (3), (4), (5), (7), and (9) for the first stage of operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{sb}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_W\\)\n\\(n_{W,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(n_{Z,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T_{ex}\\)\n\\(T_{ex,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 10.6: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations (3), (4), (5), (7), and (9) for the second stage of operation.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t_{sb}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,sb}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_W\\)\n\\(n_{W,sb}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(n_{Z,sb}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_{sb}\\)\n\\(T_f\\)\n\n\n\\(T_{ex}\\)\n\\(T_{ex,sb}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 10.5 and Table 10.6.\nI’ll start by writing the ancillary equations that I’ll need in order to evaluate the derivatives appearing in the reactor design equations. The design equations are in the form of differential expressions (see Appendix J), so no manipulation is needed to put them in that form.\nI’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables (\\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\)) will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions. Looking at equations (3), (4), (5), (7), and (9) I see that they contain the following unknown quantities: \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(V\\), \\(r_1\\), \\(\\dot{Q}\\), and \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\).\nIn this analysis, I will be choosing values of \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) to see which one gives the smallest acceptable processing time. Knowing the volume of A to be added and the volumetric flow rate at which it will be added, the semi-batch processing time, \\(t_{sb}\\), can be calculated. Before that time, the inlet molar flow rate of A will be non-zero, and it can be calculated from its volumetric flow rate since the density and molecular weight are known. The volumetric and molar flows are equal to zero during the second stage of operation.\n\\[\nt_{sb} = \\frac{V_A}{\\dot{V}_{in}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{in} \\rho_A}{M_A} \\qquad \\qquad t \\le t_{sb}\n\\]\nThe reacting liquid is an ideal solution. During the first stage of operation, liquid is being fed to the system, so the reacting fluid volume increases over time. Equation (8) can be integrated to generate an expression for the instantaneous reacting fluid volume during the first stage of operation. During the second stage of operation, the reacting fluid volume is constant and equal to its value at the end of the first stage.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot{V}_{in} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\int_{V_0}^V dV = \\dot{V}_{in} \\int_{0}^t dt\n\\]\n\\[\nV = \\dot{V}_{in} t + V_0 \\qquad \\qquad t \\le t_{sb}\n\\]\nThe given rate expression, equation (2), can be used to calculate \\(r_1\\), but that introduces the unknowns, \\(k_1\\) and \\(C_A\\). The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression and the concentration of A using the definition of concentration. The rate of heat exchange can be calculated using the heat transfer area and heat transfer coefficient, and the mass flow rate of the cooling water can be calculated from its volumetric flow rate and the density of water.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\nThe volumetric flow rate of A into the reactor during the first stage of operation will be varied over a range of values to find the one that minimizes total processing time. The corresponding inlet molar flow rate can be calculated using equation (10). The instantaneous reacting fluid volume is given by equation (11). The rate can be calculated using equation (2), with the rate coefficient and concentration of A that appear in it calculated using equations (12) and (13). The rate of heat exchange is given by equation (14) and the mass flow rate of the cooling water by equation (15).\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{in} \\rho_A}{M_A} \\qquad \\qquad t \\le t_{sb} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nV &= V_0 + \\dot{V}_{in}t; \\qquad t \\le t_{sb}\\\\\nV &= V_0 + V_A; \\qquad t &gt; t_{sb}\n\\end{aligned}\\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nk_1 = k_{0,1} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT}  \\right)} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q} = UA\\left(T - T_{ex} \\right) \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{ex} = \\dot{V}_{ex} \\rho_{ex} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to know the initial and final values Table 10.5 and Table 10.6. For the first stage of operation, the initial molar amounts can be calculated from the initial volumes, densities and molecular weights. The initial temperatures are known. I will be choosing values of \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) to see which one gives the smallest acceptable processing time. Knowing the volume of A to be added and the volumetric flow rate at which it will be added, the semi-batch processing time, \\(t_{sb}\\), can be calculated. The reactor design equations then can be solved for the first stage of processing. The resulting final values then can be used as the initial values for the second stage of operation.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values\nThe unknown initial molar amounts for the first stage of operation can be found using equations (16) and (17). The semi-batch processing time can be calculated using equation (18). The design equations for the first stage can then be solved. The resulting final values can then be used as the initial values for the second phase of operation.

From those results I can determine the total processing time and the maximum temperature. I can repeat that process using a range of values for \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) to find the value of \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) where the reaction time is a minimum and the maximum temperature is less than 95 °C.\nHaving found the optimum volumetric flow rate, I can solve the reactor design equations using it to get corresponding values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\). The conversion can be calculated using its defining equation, and I can calculate corresponding values of \\(C_A\\) using equations (11) and (13).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest\nWith the information provided above, the design equations can be solved using a range of values of \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\).

For that value of \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\), the total prcessing time is the final value of \\(t\\), and the maximum value of \\(T\\) can be determined. If the maximum value of \\(T\\) is less than 95 °C, the result satisfies the temperature constraint. After doing this for each value of \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) the resulting \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) vs. \\(t_f\\) data can be plotted to indentify the \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) that minimizes \\(t_f\\),\nThe reactor design equations then can be solved using that optimum volumetric feed rate to get corresponding values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\).

If the acetic anhydride was fed any faster, the temperature would exceed the specified maximum. Lowering the feed rate would increase the processing time. Table 10.4 shows that the cooling water reaches a maximum temperature of 77.7 °C.\nQualitative Analysis The shapes of the profile curves are consistent with a qualitative analysis of the process. During semi-batch processing two factors are at work with respect to the reactant concentration and three factors are at work with respect to the temperature. The flow into the reactor tends to increase the reactant concentration while the reaction tends to increase it. Figure 10.5 shows that the concentration passes through a maximum. Prior to the maximum, the feed is adding A faster than the reaction is consuming it. After the maximum, the opposite is true. Of course increasing the concentration tends to increase the rate and decreasing it tends to decrease the rate.\nAs for temperature, the cold feed and the cooling water remove heat and tend to lower the temperature while the reaction releases the heat of reaction. Figure 10.4 shows that initially the temperature drops very slightly. This is a result of the cold feed; heat generation is negligible because the reactant concentration is near zero making the rate very small. As the concentration of A increases the rate increases, which, in turn, increases the amount of heat being added to the system. At about the point where the concentration reaches its maximum, the temperature rise slows. This occurs because the rate is no longer increasing so rapidly. The rising temperature tends to increase it, but the decreasing reactant concentration tends to lower it.\nFinally, after all of the A has been added, the remaining A is quickly consumed. At that point, the rate goes to zero and heat is no longer being added to the system. From that point forward, the temperature drops as heat is removed by the cooling water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.",

    "text": "11.1 Design Principles and Scale\nDesign assignments can vary in scale from design of a single reactor to design of an entire process. There are principles that should guide the design no matter the scale. Among the more important principles, the process should be safe to operate, it should comply with all governmental regulations, it should not have unfavorable or unjust environmental and societal impacts, and it should be profitable.\nChemical reactors are virtually always one part of a larger process. At the largest scale, reactive process design starts with a decision to build a process from scratch. The decision to do this would be informed by some number of preliminary analyses of the market for the products from the process, the economic potential of the process, the technical feasibility of the process, etc. Full reactive process design will involve a team comprising members with expertise in finance, planning, procurement, law, construction, chemistry, engineering, safety, etc. The members with engineering expertise would include a reaction engineer among other engineering specializations such as process design, separations, control, heating and cooling, etc.\nSome of the economic factors that must be evaluated as part of the process design are capital costs (one time expenses to purchase the necessary equipment, etc.), operating costs (including labor, utilities, feedstock costs, waste disposal, etc.), maintenance costs, licensing costs (e. g. royalties for use of patented technology), income the process will generate and the return on investment. Business and legal activities include choosing the site for the process, securing necessary permits, licensing any necessary technology, identifying all regulatory restrictions that apply to the process, purchasing the equipment as specified by the design engineers, and others. The engineering team lays out the piping and processing equipment and designs the individual components, making sure that they are all properly and efficiently integrated. Specific tasks that a reaction engineer would be involved in include selecting the type of reactor(s) to be used, sizing the reactor(s) and specifying operational prameters (heating and cooling, feed temperature and composition, etc.), specifying turn-around tasks and timing for non-continuous processes, and developing procedures for start-up, operation, shut-down, and various possible emergencies.\nParticipation in a full reactive process design of the kind just described requires much deeper knowledge of reaction engineering and much more reaction engineering experience than most readers of this book are likely to possess. Preliminary design involves a more limited scope. A preliminary reactor design might be one of the factors that go into the decision to build the full process. This chapter considers preliminary design that only includes the reactor.",

    "section": "11.2 Preliminary Reactor Design",
    "text": "11.2 Preliminary Reactor Design\nA review of the examples in Chapters 9 and 10 will reveal that simply analyzing a reactor requires a relatively shallow level of understanding of reactor performance and a relatively low level of thinking. That is, if one learns how to generate and simplify the reactor design equations for a given system along with some important definitions, modeling the reactor always follows the same general steps. (Write and simplify the design equations, specify the initial and final values, write ancillary equations needed to evaluate the derivatives at the start of an integration step, write ancillary equations to calculate the initial and final values, solve the reactor design equations, and write ancillary equations and use them to calculate any other quantities of interest.) When one has that minimum level of knowledge and knows the steps to follow to solve the design equations, response and optimization tasks can be completed without too much additional thought or understanding.\nLooking at the discussion that follows many of the examples in Chapters 9 and 10, and particularly at the qualitative analyses, reveals a deeper level of understanding and a higher level of thinking. At that level, physical explanations for observed phenomena are sought and developed. That is, those discussions seek to explain in physical (not mathematical) terms why a graph has a given shape or passes through a minimum or maximum, or why increasing the inlet temperature or inlet flow rate affects the output in the way that it does. It requires deeper knowledge (e. g. what factors can cause temperature or reaction rate to change) and higher level of thinking (e. g. which of those factors are at play or important at a given point in the process; how will the importance of those factors change over the course of processing; how are those factors related to the reactor inputs).\nIt can be argued that reactor design requires an even deeper level of understanding of reactor performance and an eveh higher level of thinking. During reactor design the reaction engineer isn’t trying to explain an observed reactor response. Rather, the engineer needs to predict how to cause a desired reactor response by altering the reactor, what goes into it, and how it is operated. When a reaction engineer lacks an appropriate level of understanding or has not learned to think at an appropriate level, their design strategy can devolve to the point of trial and error which is at best inefficient and at worst, ineffective.\n\n11.2.1 Design Task Characteristics\nThe aspect of design tasks that differentiates them from response and optimization tasks is that a design task begins with an underspecifed reactor process. For BSTRs and SBSTRs the reactor design equations are a set of IVODEs with time as the independent variable. As explained in Appendix J, a set of IVODEs can be solved either to find the values of the dependent variables over time or the value of an unknown constant together with the values of the dependent variables over time. Quite simply, an underspecified reactor process does not provide enough information to solve the reactor design equations.\nRecall from Appendix J that when a set of IVODEs is solved to find the values of the dependent variables over time the following must be known: the initial values of the independent and dependent variables, the final value of one variable, and the value of every other quantity that appears in the design equations. When the set of IVODEs is solved for the value of an unknown constant, together with the values of the dependent variables over time, a second final value must be known.\nThe quantities that must be known when solving the IVODEs can be referred to collectively as the reactor model parameters. From this perspective, the distinguishing characteristic of a design assignment is that some of the reactor model parameters are not known, and the purpose of the design assignment is to find the “best” values for those parameters.\n\n\n11.2.2 Choice of the Reactor Type\nAs already mentioned, reactor design tasks begin with an underspecified reactor. In almost all cases, the assignment identifies the chemical to be produced, but very often it does not specify the type of reactor to be used. If the type of reactor to use is not specified, that is the first decision a design engineer needs to make. This chapter only considers the design of non-continuous reactors, so the choice boils down to a BSTR or an SBSTR. This choice was discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. Chapter 10 identified three situations where an SBSTR can offer a clear advantage over a BSTR: fast, highly exothermic reactions, reactions where the selectivity is strongly affected by the relative amounts of the reactants, and reversible reactions where a product can be selectivity removed. If one of these situations clearly pertains, the choice to use an SBSTR is obvious.\nWhen the choice between a BSTR and an SBSTR isn’t clear, the engineer might initially select a BSTR and begin the design process. The operation of a BSTR is slightly less detailed than an SBSTR because it isn’t necessary to start, control and stop flow going into the reactor. As such, using a BSTR simplifies operation slightly and perhaps reduces labor costs compared to an SBSTR. As the design calculations proceed, the engineer may find that an SBSTR would be more appropriate, in which case the use of a BSTR can be abandoned, and replaced with design of an SBSTR. If the engineer had initially selected an SBSTR and successfully completed a preliminary design for it, they wouldn’t know whether a BSTR could accomplish the same task more easily or economically.\n\n\n11.2.3 Reactor Metrics as Economic Indicators\nThe reactor design equations needed to model the reactor, and therefore identity of the reactor model parameters, are known once the type of reactor has been specified. The design assignment will specify some, but not all, of the values of the reactor model parameters. The design engineer must specify all of the missing reactor model parameters to create a fully specified reactor model. Before considering ways of doing that, it is helpful to understand how the fully specified reactor model will be used.\nOne of the primary goals of process design is to arrive at a fully specified reactor that will yield greatest rate of financial profit while satisfying the specifications included in the design assignment. At the preliminary design stage there are still too many unknowns for that sort of financial analysis. Instead, reactor metrics (reactor parameters and outputs) that are related to profit are used to assess and compare fully specified reactors.\nFor example, the capital and operating costs for a reactor often scale with its volume. In that case, one of the goals of the preliminary design would be to minimize the reactor volume while satisfying the specifications in the design assignment. Similarly, the use of steam or another medium for heating and the use of chilled water or another coolant have associated costs, and the amount of each heat exchange fluid used can serve as a cost indicator. The selling price of the product may depend upon its purity, and production of hazardous wastes can add to operating costs. In both of these cases, conversion and selectivity may be important metrics that are related to process profit. Any reactor design assignment is likely to have several metrics that are related to the economics of the reactor process.\nTypically the engineer will choose any one of the metrics as the key metric. The key metric would be the one that the engineer thinks will have the greatest effect upon the economics of the process. The engineer then would specify the missing reactor model parameters such that the fully specified model represents an optimization task where the key metric will be minimized or maximized, as appropriate.\n\n\n11.2.4 Specification of the Missing Reactor Model Parameters\nIn order to solve the reactor design equations and calculate the important reactor metrics, all of the missing reactor model parameters must be specified. As mentioned above, one reactor metric can be identified as the key metric. The key metric could be a reactor model parameter, such as the reactor volume, or it could be the final value of a variable, such as the final value of the amount of reactant from which the conversion could be calculated. In either case, the key metric will be maximized (or minimized, as appropriate). Thus, if the key metric is one of the missing reactor model parameters, it would be specified by saying it has the largest (or smallest) value possible.\nThe second way in which a missing reactor model parameter can be specified is by saying it is an optimization parameter. This means that its value is the value that results in key metric having the largest (or smallest) value possible. In other words, the key metric will be maximized or minimized with respect to the optimization parameters. Often, the optimization parameters are also economically important reactor metrics. Clearly, the engineer must have an understanding of reaction engineering that allows them to identify which of the missing reactor model parameters can significanly affect the key metric in order to use this type of specification effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThere can only be one key metric that is being maximized or minimized. The optimization tasks illustrated in Chapters 9 and 10 involved minimizing or maximizing a key metric with respect to a single optimization parameter and possibly a single constraint. However computer functions are readily available for maximizing or minimizing the key metric with respect to multiple optimization parameters and subject to multiple constraints (see below).\n\n\n\nThe other way of specifying a missing reactor model parameter is to assign a fixed value to it. Once all of the missing reactor model parameters have been specified, the key metric can be minimized or maximized using the fully specified reactor model. Doing so will yield the final values of the variables and the values of the key metric and the optimization paramters. At this point all of the economically important reactor metrics will be known or can be calculated.\n\n\n11.2.5 Comparing Fully Specified Reactors\nAs just described, all of the economically important reactor metrics will be known or can be calculated after the missing reactor model parameters are specified and the key metric is maximized or minimized. In the simplest design assignments, this might be all that is needed.\nIt may happen that when the key metric is minimized, one or more of the other economically important metrics has a large and unfavorable value. In design assignments, a trade-off between the economically important metrics is often observed. That is, as one important metric is optimized, another important metric changes in an unfavorable way. Sometime in this situation, the engineer might decide to analyze the same fully specified reactor system multiple times, maximizing a different metric each time. This can provide useful insight into the magnitude of the coupling between the important metrics.\nAt this point, guided by insight, knowledge and intuition, the engineer might elect to specify the missing reactor model parameters in a totally different way and see how the important metrics change and how they compare to the first fully specified reactor. The results might inspire or suggest yet more ways to specify the missing reactor model parameters.\nUltimately the engineer selects one of the fully specified reactors as the one that is most preferred. A few of the other fully specified reactors may be designated as alternatives, pointing out the trade-offs between the economically important reactor metrics. The quantity or quantities chosen as key metrics, the other quantities identified as economically important metrics, and the different ways the engineer specified the missing reactor model parameters leading up to the selection of the preferred and alternative reactor systems can be referred to as that engineer’s design strategy.\n\n\n11.2.6 Preliminary Design Constraints\nThe engineer may not have complete freedom when specifying the missing reactor model parameters. Other considerations may constrain their freedom. For example, there may be temperature limits on various process streams. These might include a maximum allowed reaction temperature (to prevent undesired reactions, phase changes in the reactor, or catalyst deactivation), a maximum outlet temperature on chilled water, or a maximum final temperature for a batch process. Safety can also impose other constraints such as a maximum temperature and/or pressure that feed and product piping can withstand, composition limits to avoid danger of explosion, etc. If anything is being discharged to the atmosphere or waterways, regulations may restrict composition.\nThe design specifications often set the net production rate (see Equation 9.1) or equivalently, the total volume to be processed and the total time during which that must happen. For a non-continuous process, this establishes a relationship between the volume per batch (i. e. the reactor volume) and the total time per batch. Specifically, both the volume per batch and the time per batch are related to the number of batches, Equation 11.1.\n\\[\nN_{batches} = \\frac{V_{total}}{V_{batch}} = \\frac{t_{total}}{t_{batch}}\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nIf the design assignment specifies the net production rate, but does not fix either the volume per batch or the time per batch, then the design engineer can specify one or the other. If the reaction engineer specifies the volume per batch, the time per batch is constrained as shown in Equation 11.2, and if the engineer specifies the time per batch, the volume per batch is constrained as shonw in Equation 11.3. Equations 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 are written in terms of the volume being processed, but any measure of the amount to be processed could be used.\n\\[\nN_{batches} = \\frac{V_{total}}{V_{batch}} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t_{batch} \\le \\frac{t_{total}}{N_{batches}}\n\\tag{11.2}\\]\n\\[\nN_{batches} = \\frac{t_{total}}{t_{batch}} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad V_{batch} \\ge \\frac{V_{total}}{N_{batches}}\n\\tag{11.3}\\]\nConstraints often do not apply directly to the specifications that the engineer adds to the design specifications. Instead, they indirectly limit the choices the engineer can make. That is, after the engineer specifies the missing reactor model parameters, the reactor model equations must be solved in order to determine whether any of the constraints are violated. Computer functions that perform constrained, multi-parameter optimization are available in many software packages.",

    "text": "11.3 Example\nReaders who have assimilated the knowledge and skills from Chapters 9 and 10 are capable of non-continuous reactor analysis. This chapter emphasizes design strategy, not analysis. More specifically, the focus is on choosing the reactor type, identifying a key reactor metric and other economically important metrics, and specifying the missing reactor model parameters.\nFor this reason, the example provided here does not include any calculations. Instead, it focuses on the engineer’s thought processes and the resulting design strategy the engineer develops. The engineer may revise or expand their design strategy as they proceed through the analyses, but since analysis is not included in these examples, that aspect of the design process is not illustrated.\nEven though it is quite simple, the following example describes one engineer’s thinking and the design strategy that engineer develops based on that thinking. A different engineer might think differently and develop a different design strategy. Assuming they are competent, both engineers will arrive at a preliminary design that satisfies the design specifications, but their preliminary designs may be different from each other. It is critially important for readers to recognize that this example is not a “cook book” for what you should be thinking while developing your design strategy, but rather an example of what one engineer might be thinking as they develop their design strategy. Since the engineer’s thinking is the essence of this example the usual “Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point” callouts are not used.\n\n11.3.1 Preliminary Reactor Design for an Autocatalytic Reaction\nBackground: A specialty chemical company is considering producing reagent Z in a non-continuous process. A preliminary marketing study suggests yearly sales of 30,000 gal per year might be expected if the purity is 99% or greater. The proposed process would produce Z three times per year with each production period lasting four-weeks. The reactor would be used for other purposes the rest of the time. Chilled water at 18 °C is available as is saturated steam at 50 psi. Storage tanks will be used to hold the 99% pure product between the time it is produced and the time it is sold.\nZ can be produced from reagent A which is available in essentially pure form at ambient temperature (20 °C). The irreversible, exothermic, autocatalytic reaction, \\(A + Z \\rightarrow 2Z\\), is first order in A and in Z. In the absence of Z, the rate is very small. When both A and Z are present, the rate is measurable at 20 °C. The reaction is moderately exothermic. Reagents A and Z are liquids and form an ideal solution. The product, Z, has the lower boiling point, 96 °C. A rate expression and all necessary thermochemical data are available.\nAssignment: Perform a preliminary design of a reactor that can be used as described above.\n\n\n11.3.1.1 Design Strategy\nAs the engineer who was given this assignment, here’s what I’m thinking:\n\nFor this non-continuous process, I could use either a BSTR or an SBSTR.\n\nThe reaction is exothermic, so if the temperature cannot be safely controlled, I will have to use an SBSTR.\nI’ll start my analysis assuming the reactor operates as a BSTR.\n\nI’ll use one week as the basis for my calculations.\n\n30,000 gal must be processed over 12 weeks or 2500 gal per week.\n\nI’ll assume that capital and operating costs scale with the reactor volume, in which case I’ll want to minimize the volume of the reactor.\n\nThe resulting volume will impose an upper limit constraint on the processing time, Equation 11.2.\n\nI want the rate to be as large as possible at all times.\nHaving some Z present initially is essential for an acceptable rate.\n\nThis suggests that during turnaround the reactor should not be emptied completely.\n\nThe reaction is exothermic; the temperature will rise continually if no cooling is provided.\n\nI’ll assume that some cooling will be necessary, but I’d like to use as little cooling water as possible to reduce operating costs.\nSince the reaction rate is “measurable” at ambient conditions, I’ll assume no heating is necessary.\n\nThe conversion must be at least 99%.\nTo provide a margin of safety and keep the product from boiling (at 96 °C), I’ll specify a maximum temperature of 90 °C.\nThe product that is left in the reactor during turnaround will be hot and the A that is added to it will be at 20 °C (ambient temperature)\n\nThe initial temperature will depend upon the relative amounts of A and Z.\n\nFor cooling I’ll assume the reactor is jacketed and that the jacket volume and heat transfer area are geometrically related to the volume.\n\nI’ll assume that I can determine that relationship along with the heat transfer coefficient from stirred tank vendor literature.\n\nIf the temperature cannot be controlled below 90 °C, I’ll switch to using an SBSTR.\n\nBased upon my thinking above, here is my design strategy.\n\nAssume the reactor is a jacketed BSTR with a volume, \\(V\\).\n\nUse stirred tank manufacturer’s literature to estimate the jacket volume, heat transfer area and heat transfer coefficient.\nAssume that chilled water flows into the jacket at 18 °C with a flow rate of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\).\n\nAt the end of processing \\(X\\)% of the reactor contents are removed and transferred to storage.\n\nthe turnaround time needed for this can be estimated.\n\nTo start a batch, a sufficient amount of pure A at 20 °C to fill the reactor is added instantaneously.\n\nAssuming perfect mixing, the initial temperature and molar amounts of A and Z can be calculated.\n\nThe processing ends when the conversion of A reaches 99%.\n\nUsing the reactor design equations for this system, the reactor volume can be minimized with respect to \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) and \\(X\\) subject to the constraints that the temperature is below 90 °C at all times and that the processing time satisfies Equation 11.2.\nThe reactor volume is the key metric to be minimized. The coolant flow rate is also an economically important metric that should be as small as possible.\nIt may not prove possible to meet the design specifications and satisfy the constraints using my initial specifications for the missing reactor model parameters. Whether or not it is possible, the following modifications of the system should be analyzed.\n\nDuring turnaround, partially cool the fluid that is not removed from the reactor prior to adding the fresh feed and starting the next batch.\nDrain the jacket during turnaround and initially operate the reactor adiabatically, starting the coolant flow when the temperature reaches \\(T_1\\), with \\(T_1\\) as an additional optimization parameter.\nOperate as an SBSTR, adding the fresh feed at a steady rate, \\(V_{in}\\), with \\(V_{in}\\) as an additional optimization parameter.\n\nThe minimized volumes for each system should be compared and the one with the smalles \\(V\\) should be reported as the preferred design. If any of the other designs have a volume close to the volume of the preferred design, but with a coolant usage much smaller than the preferred design, they should be reported as alternative designs.\n\n\n11.3.1.2 Discussion\nThis was a very simple example, and many details were not included in the design strategy. One thing to note is that by minimizing with respect to the coolant flow rate, the possibliity that no cooling is necessary is included. In that case the optimim coolant flow rate would be essentially zero.\nThe total volume to be processed per week in this example is 2500 gal. It is important to recognize that the minimized volume, \\(V\\) that is found using the design equations is the total reactor volume. However, at the start of the process \\(X\\)% of that volume was not fresh feed. Also, the time per batch is the processing time plus the turnaround time. As a result, the constraint on the processing time is given by equation (1).\n\\[\nt_{batch} \\le \\frac{t_{total}}{N_{batches}}\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{batches} = \\frac{2500\\text{ gal}}{\\left(1 - \\frac{X}{100}\\right)V}\n\\]\n\\[\nt_{turnaround} + t_{processing} \\le \\frac{1\\text{ week}}{2500\\text{ gal}}\\left(1 - \\frac{X}{100}\\right)V\n\\]\n\\[\nt_{processing} \\le \\frac{1\\text{ week}}{2500\\text{ gal}}\\left(1 - \\frac{X}{100}\\right)V - t_{turnaround} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nThere are a lot of “what-if’s” associated this assignment. For example, what if, with no cooling, the heat of reaction only caused the temperature to rise to 50 °C? In that case, it might be beneficial to use heat to raise the initial temperature. That would lead to a higher rate, and consequently a smaller reactor. (Of course the costs associated with the heating would need to be offset by the lower capital and operating costs due to a smaller volume.) A good design engineer is constantly asking and answering these what-if’s as one means of refining and improving their design strategy.",

    "text": "12.1 CSTR Characteristics\nAs was the case for BSTRs and SBSTRs, one essential characteristic of CSTRs is that the contents are perfectly mixed at all times. While stirred tanks are the most common type of CSTR in commercial facilities, other physical geometries and formats are possible, but their contents must always be perfectly mixed. Stirred tanks are well-suited to liquid phase reactions because a simple impeller can be used to do the mixing. Attaining perfect mixing of gases in large vessels can be more challenging.\nThe characteristic that differentiates a CSTR from BSTRs and SBSTRs is the continuous flow of fluid into and out of the reactor as the reaction is taking place. This is what allows them to operate continuously. Unlike BSTRs and SBSTRs, there isn’t a need to stop the reaction, and drain and re-fill the reactor. A fresh feed stream enters continuously and a converted product stream leaves continuously.\nThis results in two possible modes of operation, steady-state and transient. At steady-state, nothing changes over time. The inlet flow rate, temperature, and composition; the outlet flow rate, temperature, and composition; and the heat exchange fluid flow rate, inlet temperature, and outlet temperature are all constant. CSTRs are designed to operate at steady-state. Once a steady state has been reached, the labor demands to operate the reactor are minimal. Integration with other operations in the process such as feed purification, product separation, etc. is easier to implement when the entire process operates at steady-state.\nThere are times when a CSTR must operate in a transient mode, such as when the process is being started up and when it is being shut down. This type of transient operation is typically planned, for example, the reactor might be shut down periodically so that routine maintenance can be performed. Unexpected events can also initiate transient operation of a CSTR. For example, a sudden change in the coolant flow rate or temperature or a change in the feed flow or temperature will initiate transient operation.\nCompared to the other type of ideal continuous reactor, namely the PFR, the most significant feature of a CSTR is the instantaneous mixing of the feed into the reacting fluid. As a consequence of this mixing the temperature and composition of the reacting fluid is constant for the entire time that the fluid is in the reactor at steady-state. Furthermore, the temperature and composition of the reacting fluid are the final or outlet temperature and composition. Depending upon the reaction kinetics, this can be either an advantage or a disadvantage, as described later in this chapter. Generally use of a CSTR can be advantageous when the reaction is exothermic and/or auto-catalytic. It can be disadvantageous when the reaction is endothermic and/or when the reaction kinetics are typical (i.e. higher reactant concentrations result in larger rates).\nBeing continuous reactors, CSTRs are well-suited to the production of high volumes of product compared to non-continuous reactors. Another advantage of CSTRs is that they can have a wide range of heat transfer area relative to the reacting fluid volume. This is possible because in addition to exchanging heat through the walls of the reactor, a coil through which heat exchange fluid flows can be submerged in the reacting fluid and/or reacting fluid can be rapidly recirculated through an external heat exchanger. (These heat exchange geometries are illustrated for BSTRs in Figure 9.1.)\nThe requirement that the reacting fluid be perfectly mixed can be a disadvantage. If the reacting fluid has a high viscosity, mixing it thoroughly can be very difficult and can consume a great deal of power. Similarly if the reaction requires a solid catalyst, use of a CSTR is impractical or impossible because “stirring” a tank full of solid particles doesn’t work.",

    "text": "12.2 CSTR Operation\nCSTRs are designed to operate at steady-state for extended periods of time. Before that can happen, the reactor must be started up. Start-up is a transient process. There are many, many different ways to start up a CSTR. Three goals of start-up are to bring the reactor to steady-state as quickly as possible, to minimize waste while doing so, and to do it all safely. One option is to fill the reactor with the feed and operate it as a batch reactor until the composition and temperature are close to their intended steady-state values, at which time the feed and product flow can be started.\nOccasionally CSTRs must be shut down, too. This may be necessary to perform maintenance on the reactor itself, or it may be necessary because an upstream, downstream, or utility (chilled water, etc.) process needs to be shut down. Again, shut-down is a transient process, and the same guidelines as for start-up apply. It is particularly important to analyze the shut-down process prior to implementing it, especially for exothermic processes. If the wrong procedure is used to shut down a reactor, explosions and other undesired events can ensue.\nDuring steady-state operation, automatic control systems can be used to maintain steady-state processing of the feed. Such control systems can make small adjustments to compensate for minor variations in the reactor inputs. Reactor models like those described in this chapter can be used when designing control systems for a CSTR.",

    "section": "12.3 Qualitative Analysis of Steady-State Reaction in a CSTR",
    "text": "12.3 Qualitative Analysis of Steady-State Reaction in a CSTR\nThe qualitative analysis of BSTRs was described in Chapter 9. It involves setting the initial temperature and composition and then considering how they would change during small increments of time. In this way the curvature of graphs of temperature, composition, rate, etc over time can be predicted. If the curvature will not lead to equilibrium, events that must occur to cause them to lead to equilibrium can be inferred. In a steady-state CSTR, nothing changes with time, but nonetheless, a very similar approach can be used.\nIn a CSTR, the time during which the reaction occurs is the amount of time that the fluid remains in the reactor. It is not related to elapsed clock time. For a fixed reactor volume, the slower the volumetric flow through the reactor, the longer the time the fluid spends in the reactor. Recall that the space time is the reacting fluid volume divided by the inlet volumetric flow rate. Thus, the space time is a measure of the time during which reaction takes place. With that understanding, the qualitative analysis of a CSTR is analogous to the qualitative analysis of a BSTR except that small increments of the space time are used in place of small increments in reaction time.\nThere is one important difference between an increment of reaction time in a BSTR and an increment of space time in a CSTR. Consider the concentration of a reactant in the reactor at some point during processing. When qualitatively analyzing a BSTR, any change in that concentration during the next small increment of reaction time only applies during that increment. When qualitatively analyzing a CSTR, a change in concentration due to a small increment of the space time applies for the entire time when reaction occurs.\nPut differently at a given CSTR space time, the reactant concentration is constant for the entire time the fluid spends in the reactor, i. e. for the entire time during which reaction occurs. If the space time is increased incrementally, the fluid will spend slighly more time in the reactor, that allows slightly more reaction to occur, and consequently the reactant concentration will be slightly smaller. The important difference is that the slightly smaller reactant concentration will prevail for the entire time that the fluid spends in the reactor. Because each incremental change of space time applies over the entire reaction time in a CSTR, the changes it causes will generally be greater than those in a BSTR where an incremental change only affects that increment of time and not the entire reaction time.\nIt is instructive to compare the effects of composition and temperature over the entire time during which reaction occurs in a BSTR and a CSTR. For illustrative purposes consider a first-order reaction in isothermal reactors. In a BSTR, the reaction rate is high initially. Then as the reactant is consumed, the rate decreases over time. In a CSTR oprating at a space time equal to the BSTR reaction time, the concentration of the reactant is at its lowest value for the whole time, so the rate is low the entire time reaction is taking place. As a consequence, the overall conversion in the CSTR will be smaller.\nThe same effect is seen with temperature, but for an adiabatic, exothermic reaction, this gives an advantage to the CSTR. The temperature will rise over time in the BSTR, but in the CSTR the temperature is at its final, highest value the entire time the reaction is taking place. Assuming Arrhenius temperature dependence of the rate coefficient, that means that the rate coefficient will be larger in the CSTR than at the start of batch processing.",

    "section": "12.4 CSTR Design Equations",
    "text": "12.4 CSTR Design Equations\nThe reactor design equations for CSTRs are derived in Appendix H and discussed in Chapter 6. The general CSTR mole balance, Equation 6.24, and reacting fluid energy balance, Equation 6.25, are reproduced below along with the energy balances for the heat exchange fluid for the two situations where it exchanges only sensible heat, Equation 6.2, and where it exchanges only latent heat, Equation 6.6. The choice of which equations to use when modeling a particular reactor is also discussed in Chapter 6.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} + \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\\frac{dV}{dt} - \\frac{\\dot n_iV}{\\dot V^2}\\frac{d \\dot V}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) &\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\&- \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\]\nThe transient CSTR design equations are IVODEs. The numerical solution of IVODEs requires initial values for each of the dependent variables. This can lead to confusion when first learning to model transient CSTRs because both initial and inlet variables are used when solving the design equations. The key point to remember is that the dependent variables in the IVODEs are the outlet molar flow rates, temperature and exchange fluid temperature. As a consequence, the initial values that are needed to solve the IVODEs are the initial values of the outlet molar flows and temperatures, not their inlet values.\nIt is noted in Chapter 6 that when a CSTR operates at steady-state, nothing changes over time. consequently the time derivatives in the design equations all equal zero. The corresponding reactor design equations are reproduced below.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot Q - \\dot W - \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\]\nIt is important to note that the \\(V\\frac{dP}{dt}\\) and \\(P\\frac{dV}{dt}\\) terms in the transient reacting fluid energy balance will have different units than the other terms, as was the case for the BSTR and SBSTR reacting fluid energy balances. As described in Chapter 6, the CSTR design equations can be modified and simplified, depending upon the particular CSTR being modeled. For liquid phase reacting fluids, the gravimetric or volumetric heat capacity may be known instead of the molar heat capacities of the individual reagents, in which case the sensible heat terms can be modified.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\tilde C_pdT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\breve C_pdT\n\\]\nThe power associated with an agitator that is used to stir a liquid-phase reacting fluid is often negligible, \\(\\dot{W} = 0\\). In most cases involving a gas phase reacting fluid, the pressure and reacting fluid volume in a CSTR are constant, so their time derivatives are equal to zero. For liquids, if the inlet and outlet flow rates are not equal, the reacting fluid volume in a CSTR will change over time as was the case for SBSTRs.\nWhen rate expressions are substituted into the CSTR design equations, they will introduce concentrations or, for gases, partial pressures. Noting that the CSTR is perfectly mixed so that the outlet composition and temperature are the same as that of the reacting fluid, the concentrations or partial pressures in the rate expressions should be expressed in terms of the outlet molar flow rates and temperature.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{V}}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\sum_i \\left(\\dot{n}_i\\right)}\\frac{P}{RT} \\qquad i = \\text{ ideal gas}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\sum_i \\left(\\dot{n}_i\\right)}P \\qquad i = \\text{ ideal gas}\n\\]",

    "text": "12.5 Steady-State Multiplicity\nUpon substitution of rate expressions, the steady-state CSTR design equations are non-linear because the rate expression contains an exponential term and may also contain terms other than concentrations raised to the first power. Non-linear equations can have more than one solutions. For example, a quadratic equation has two solutions. Therefore it is possible for there to be more than one solution of the steady-state CSTR design equations.\nSometimes when model equations have two or more soltuions, only one of them is phycially meaningful, and the others can be ignored. This is not the case when the steady-state CSTR reactor design equations have multiple solutions. As an example, Example 12.7.4 describes an adiabatic, steady-state CSTR and shows that the reactor design equations have three solutions. Furthermore, each of the three solutions is physically feasible.\nFigure 12.2 shows the outlet temperature of the adiabatic, steady-state CSTR described in Example 12.7.4 calculated as a function of inlet temperature. The figure shows that between the two vertical red lines, the temperature curve doubles back above itself twice leading to an “S” shape. Clearly, at any inlet temperature between the two red lines, there are three steady-state outlet temperatures. (The three compositions corresponding to those steady-states are also different from each other, see Example 12.7.4.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Steady-state outlet temperature as a function of inlet temperature for the adiabatic CSTR described in Section 12.7.4.\n\n\n\nIf a vertical line is drawn at any inlet temperature between the red lines in Figure 12.2, it will cross the curve three times. The points where a vertical line crosses are the three steady-state outlet temperatures for that inlet temperature. This phenomenon is known as steady-state multiplicity. Other features of Figure 12.2 will be discussed below; the important point here is that the steady-state CSTR design equations can have multiple solutions that are physically feasible.\nIt is worth noting that while some of the inlet temperatures result in multiple outlet temperatures, there is only one inlet temperature that coresponds to each outlet temperature. That is, if a horizontal line is drawn at any outlet temperature, it will cross the curve only one time.\nOne might wonder, then, if the inlet temperature to the actual reactor corresponding to Figure 12.2 is set to say 60 °C, which of the three outlet temperatures shown in the figure will actually be observed? The answer to this question is that the transient procedure used to start up the reactor and bring its inlet temperature to 60 °C will determine which of the steady states is actually observed.",

    "text": "12.6 Steady-State Stability and Sensitivity\nWithin the range of inlet temperatures where multiple steady states are possible, Figure 12.2 shows the upper and lower outlet temperatures as solid lines, but it shows the intermediate outlet temperature as a dashed line. The significance of the dashed line is that the steady states with the intermediate outlet temperature are unstable.\n\n12.6.1 Stability of Steady States\nIf the steady-state, adiabatic CSTR corresponding to Figure 12.2 was somehow operating at an outlet temperature on the dashed portion of the curve, the steady state would be unstable. A slight perturbation of any reactor property would initiate a period of transient operation, and at the end of that transient period, the reactor would be at either the high steady-state outlet temperature or at the low steady state temperature. That is, if a CSTR somehow operates at an unstable steady state, it will not return to that unstable steady state following even a small perturbation away from it.\nExample 12.7.6 presents a rigorous analysis of such a perturbation. However, a non-rigorous analysis may provide insight and understanding as to why the middle-temperature steady state is unstable. It involves a very roundabout way of solving the steady-state CSTR design equations, and can be illustrated by reference to Example 12.7.4.\nThe reacting fluid energy balance in Example 12.7.4, reproduced below, consists of two terms. One term represents sensible heat absorbed by the feed as it enters the reactor, Equation 12.1 and the other represents the heat generated by the reaction, Equation 12.2. Clearly, the reacting fluid energy balance is only satisfied if the two terms are equal, Equation 12.3.\n\\[\n0 = -\\dot{V}_{in} \\rho \\tilde{C}_p \\left( T - T_{in}\\right) - Vr_1 \\Delta H_1 = \\epsilon_5\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{abs} = \\dot{V}_{in} \\rho \\tilde{C}_p \\left( T - T_{in}\\right)\n\\tag{12.1}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{gen} = - Vr_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\tag{12.2}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{abs} = \\dot{Q}_{gen}\n\\tag{12.3}\\]\nA very roundabout way of solving the full set of steady-state CSTR design equation begins by choosing a range of values for the reactor outlet temperature. Knowing the outlet temperature, the mole balance design equations can be solved to find all of the outlet molar flow rates corresponding to each outlet temperature. Knowing the inlet and outlet molar flow rates and the inlet temperature, \\(\\dot{Q}_{abs}\\) and \\(\\dot{Q}_{gen}\\) can be calculated for each outlet temperature in the chosen range using Equation 12.1 and Equation 12.2. Finally \\(\\dot{Q}_{abs}\\) and \\(\\dot{Q}_{gen}\\) can each be plotted vs. the outlet temperatures on a single graph. The reacting energy balance is satisfied when the two curves cross, Equation 12.3, so the steady-state temperatures corresponding to the points where the curves cross can be read from the graph.\nThat roundabout way of solving the design equations was applied to Example 12.7.4. The resulting heat generated and heat absorbed curves are shown in Figure 12.3. The curves cross three times corresponding to the three steady states. In the figure the three steady states are labeled “low”, “middle,” and “high.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Heat absorbed and heat generated as function of the outlet temperature in Example 12.7.4.\n\n\n\nSuppose a CSTR was operating at the low temperature steady state and somehow the temperature was increased very slightly. That is, on the graph, suppose the operating point shifted slightly to the right of the intersection labeled low. At that new point the heat absorption (blue) would be greater than the heat generation (red), causing the operating temperature to decrease (i. e. to shift back toward the low point).\nSimilarly, if the CSTR was operating at the low steady state and somehow the temperature was decreased (shifted left) slightly, heat generation (red) would be greater than heat absorption (blue), causing the temperature to increase (i. e. to again shift back toward the low point). This argument suggests that the low temperature steady state is stable because following a small perturbation away from it, the system returns back to it. The exact same argument can be applied to the high temperature steady state. Following any small perturbation from it, the system returns to it.\nNow consider the middle temperature steady state. If somehow the operating temperature is increased very slightly (i. e. shifted to the right), the heat generation will be greater than the heat absorption. This will cause the temperature to rise. That is, the point will move even farther to the right. In fact, it will continue to move to the right until it reaches the high temperature steady state.\nIf somehow the temperature of a CSTR operating at the middle temperature steady state is decreased very slightly (i. e. shifted slightly to the left), the heat absorbed will exceed the heat generated and the temperature will decrease. That is, the point will move farther to the left. This will continue until the point reaches the low temperature steady state.\nThese arguments are not rigorous because the curves in Figure 12.3 only apply at steady state, and once the system is perturbed, it is operating in transient mode. Nonetheless, the conclusions drawn are correct (see Example 12.7.6 for a rigorous confirmation.) The middle steady state is unstable. Any perturbation to a reactor operating at the middle steady state will initiate a transient that ends at one of the two stable steady states.\nThere is another possible result of perturbing a steady-state reactor. The reactor could go into a state of sustained, periodic oscillations. This possibility is not considered in Reaction Engineering Basics. The topic of steady state stability is often considered in detail in more advanced reaction engineering books and courses.\n\n\n12.6.2 Parametric Sensitivity of CSTRs\nFor reasons just described, real CSTRs do not operate at unstable steady states. This leads to one type of parametric sensitivity known as hysteresis. Figure 12.4 shows only the stable steady states from Figure 12.2. Consider a CSTR operating at steady state with an inlet temperature of -20 °C, where only one steady state is possible. If the inlet temperature is very slowly increased in a way that the reactor remains at steady-state, the outlet temperature will slowly rise along the lower black curve in the figure until it reaches the solid red line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Steady-state outlet temperature of a CSTR as a function of the inlet temperature.\n\n\n\nThe point where the temperature just reaches the solid red line is called the ignition point. A slight increase in the temperature beyond the ignition point causes the reactor to rapidly “jump” to the upper curve. That is, if the temperature is raised just slightly above the ignition point, the temperature jumps from ca. 100 °C to over 300 °C. This is clearly undesirable and unsafe.\nIf the CSTR was operating at an inlet temperature of 100 °C (outlet temperature ~320 °C) and the feed temperature was very slowly decreased so that the reactor remained at steady state, it would follow the upper black curve in the figure until it reached the dashed red line. The point where the temperature just reaches the dashed red line is called the extinction point. Lowering the temperature just slightly below the extinction point would cause the reactor temperature to drop to the lower black curve. That is, the reaction rate would suddenly become very small.\nIgnition and extinction are demonstrated quantitatively in Example 12.7.6. The area bounded on the sides by the red lines and on top and bottom by the black lines is known as a hysteresis loop. As the temperature is slowly raised, the system follows the lower black curve until it reached the solid red line, where upon it jumps to the upper black curve. Upon cooling, the system traces the upper black curve until it reaches the dashed red line at which point it jumps to the lower black curve.\nIgnition and extinction are one type of parametric sensitivity. More generally, when a small change in a reactor operating parameter results in an extreme change in the output, the reactor is said to be parametrically sensitive to the parameter being changed. Identifying and avoiding operation at conditions near points of parametric sensitivity is essential for the safe operation of CSTRs.\nOther types of parametric sensitivity and methods for identifying them are typically presented in more advanced books and courses on reaction engineering. They have been introduced here so that readers are aware of the phenomenon.",

The former involves two liquid-phase reactions while the second involves a gas phase reaction. In Example 12.7.1 the assignment is to calculate the reactor output, while in Example 12.7.2 the assignment is to calculate the input needed to achieve a specified output.

In the first analysis the CSTR is operating at an unstable steady state, and when it is perturbed, the transient ends when it reaches a different, stable steady state. The other two analyses illustrate ignition and extinction.\n\n12.7.1 Response of a Steady-State CSTR\nReactants A and B can react irreversibly to produce either a desired product, D, or an undesired product, U, as shown in equations (1) and (2).

A liquid mixture containing 10 mol A gal-1 and 12 mol B gal-1 at 350 K is fed to an adiabatic 25 gal CSTR at a rate of 12.5 gal min-1.

I’ll simply write a mole balance for every reagent. Here the reactor operates at steady-state, so the general mole balance is given by Equation 6.31. Two reactions are taking place, so the summation expands to two terms. Only A and B are flowing into the reactor, so \\(\\dot{n}_{D,in}\\) and \\(\\dot{n}_{U,in}\\) are equal to zero.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + \\cancelto{V\\left(\\nu_{i,1}r_1 + \\nu_{i,2}r_2\\right)}{V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j}\n\\]\nThe reactor is not isothermal, so an energy balance must also be included among the reactor design equations. For a steady-state CSTR the general energy balance is given by Equation 6.32. This reactor is adiabatic, so the rate of heat transfer is equal to zero. There are no shafts or moving boundaries that are doing work, so the rate of doing work is also equal to zero. Only A and B flow into the reactor, so the sum over the reagents reduces to two terms. Also, since the heat capacities are constant, the integral can be evaluated. Finally, there are two reactions taking place, so the final sum expands to two terms.\n\\[\n0 = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - \\cancelto{\\left(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\hat{C}_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_{B,in}\\hat{C}_{p,B}\\right)\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)}{\\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT} - \\cancelto{V\\left(r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2\\right)}{V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\]\nThis reactor is adiabatic, so there isn’t a heat exchange fluid to write an energy balance for.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, D, and U are presented in equations (5) through (8), and an energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (9), all in the form of residual expressions. These equations can be solved to find the outlet molar flow rates and temperature, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{A,in} - \\dot n_A + V \\left( -r_1 - r_2\\right) = \\epsilon_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{B,in} - \\dot n_B + V \\left( -r_1 - r_2\\right) = \\epsilon_2 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot n_D + V r_1 = \\epsilon_3 \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot n_U + V r_2 = \\epsilon_4 \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = -\\left( \\dot{n}_{A,in}\\hat C_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_{B,in}\\hat C_{p,B}\\right) \\left(T - T_{in}\\right) - V\\left( r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2\\right) = \\epsilon_5 \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this assignment reactor design equations will be solved for the unknown outlat molar flow rates and temperature. In order to solve the ATEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the residuals for each guess and provide an initial guess.\nStarting with evaluating the residuals, I’ll need to evaluate them each time a new guess for the solution is generated. At that point, values for each of the unknowns (\\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\)) will be available along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the residuals expressions. Examination of equations (5) through (9) shows that I’ll need to write equations for calculating the inlet molar flow rates of A and B, the reaction rates, and the heats of reaction. (Note that the assignment narrative provided the standard heats of reaction at 298K, but it did not indicate that the heats were constant with temperature.)\nThe volumetric feed rate and the feed concentrations of A and B are given. The inlet molar flow rates of A and B can be found using the defining equation for concentration in a flow system.\n\\[\nC_{i,in} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{i,in}}{\\dot{V}_{in}} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\dot{n}_{i,in} = C_{i,in}\\dot{V}_{in}\n\\]\nThe reaction rates can be calculated using the rate expressions, equations (3) and (4), but that introduces the rate coefficients and outlet concentrations of A and B which must be calculated. The rate coefficients can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression , Equation 4.8.\n\\[\nk_j = k_{0,j} \\exp{\\left(  \\frac{-E_j}{RT} \\right)}\n\\]\nThe outlet concentrations can be calculated using their definitions. The reacting fluid here is an ideal liquid, and is assumed to be incompressible, so the inlet and outlet volumetric flow rates will be equal.\n\\[\nC_{i} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{V}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{V}_{in}}\n\\]\nFinally, the heats of reaction can be calculated using Equation D.3.

I have no idea what the outlet molar flow rates or the outlet temperature will equal. To start, I’ll simply guess that half of the A remains along with an equal amount of B, and that the amounts of D and U are one-tenth the initial amount of A. (These are just guesses; they don’t need to be stoichiometrically consistent.) I expect that the temperature will have the greatest effect with respect to the ATE solver converging, so I’ll just guess that the temperature increases by only 10 K. If the ATE solver does fail to converge, I’ll have to revise these guesses.\nAt this point, the reactor design equations can be solved numerically to find the unknowns, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\). In addition to the outlet temperature, the conversion of the limiting reagent and the selectivity for D over U are of interest in this assignment.\nThe inlet concentration of A is smaller than that of B, so A is the limiting reagent. Its conversion can be calculated using the defining equation for conversion in a flow system. The calculation of the selectivity is straightforward.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest\nSolving the reactor design equations yields \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\). The conversion of A and the selectivity for D over U can be calculated using equations (18) and (19).\n\\[\nf_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_{A,in}} \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nS_{D/U} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_D}{\\dot{n}_U} \\tag{19}\n\\]\nCalculations Summary\n\nSubstitute given and known constants into all equations.\nWhen it is necessary to evaluate the residuals\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\) will be available.\ncalculate \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(k_1\\), \\(k_2\\), \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), \\(\\Delta H_1\\), and \\(\\Delta H_2\\) using equations (10) through (17).\ncalculate \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) using equations (3) and (4).\ncalculate \\(\\epsilon_1\\), \\(\\epsilon_2\\), \\(\\epsilon_3\\), \\(\\epsilon_4\\), \\(\\epsilon_5\\) using equations (5) through (9).\n\nWhen it is necessary to calculate the quantities of interest, \\(f_A\\) and \\(S_{D/U}\\)\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\) will be available.\ncalculate \\(f_A\\) and \\(S_{D/U}\\) using equations (18) and (19)\n\n\n\n\n12.7.1.3 Numerical implementation of the Solution\n\nMake the given and known constants available for use in all functions.\nWrite a residuals function that\n\nreceives guess values for \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\),\nevaluates the residuals as described in step 2 of the calculations summary, and\nreturns the values of the residuals.\n\nWrite a reactor model function that\n\nreceives, as an argument, an initial guess for the unknowns, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\),\ngets a solution for the ATEs by calling an ATE solver and passing the following information to it\n\nthe initial guess and\nthe name of the residuals function from step 2 above, d, checks that the solver converged, and\n\nreturns the values returned by the ATE solver.\n\nPerform the analysis by\n\nsetting an initial guess for the unknowns\ngetting \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\) by calling the reactor model function from step 3 above with the initial guess as the argument,\ncalculating the quantities of interest as described in step 3 of the calculations summary, and\ndisplaying the results.\n\n\n\n\n12.7.1.4 Results and Discussion\nThe calculations were performed as described above. The conversion of A is 54.9 %, the selectivity is 8.39 mol D per mol U, and the outlet temperature is 383 K.\nThe instantaneous selectivity is defined in Equation 4.5. Applying that definition to this system yields equation (20). According to that equation, the only way to increase the selectivity is to increase \\(k_1\\) or decrease \\(k_2\\). The only way to change the rate coefficients is by changing the temperature, but changing the temperature will change both rate coefficients.\n\\[\nS_{D/U} =  \\frac{r_D}{r_U} = \\frac{k_1 C_AC_B}{k_2 C_AC_B} = \\frac{k_1}{k_2} = \\frac{k_{0,1} \\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_1}{RT}\\right)}}{k_{0,2} \\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_2}{RT}\\right)}}  \\tag{20}\n\\]\nThe activation energy for reaction (2) is larger than that for reaction (1), so increasing the temperature will increase \\(k_2\\) more than \\(k_1\\), resulting in a lower selectivity for D over U. Thus, the selectivity for D over U can be increased by decreasing the temperature. However, if everything else remains fixed, decreasing the temperature will decrease the conversion. That is, decreasing the temperature will increase the selectivity but decrease the conversion while increasing the temperature will decrease the selectivity but increase the conversion.\nTo verify this prediction, the feed temperature was decreased to 325 K and the calculations were repeated. The selectivity did indeed increase to 10.6 mol D per mol U, and the conversion decreased to 46.7 %. Increasing the temperature to 375 K gives a selectivity of 6.9 mol D per mol U and a conversion of 61.5 %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen completing reaction engineering assignments involving CSTSs, it is important to be able to determine whether the reactor is transient or at steady-state. If the assignment describes start-up or shut-down or mentions that some parameter was perturbed or suddenly changed, the reactor will be transient. Basically, transient operation occurs following some change to the way the reactor operates.\nOne situation that can cause confusion when first studying CSTRs is when an assignments asks how a reactor output changes as a reactor input varies. This type of assignment must be read carefully. In many cases the assignment is asking how the steady-state output changes as the steady-state input varies. If the assignment is to calculate the transient change of the output, then the assignment must specify how the input changes. That is it would need to something like “show how the outlet concentration changes if the feed temperature changes by 5 °C min-1,” and not just “show how the outlet concentration changes as the feed temperature is varied.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7.2 Gas Phase Reaction in an Adiabatic, Steady-State CSTR\nThe amount of A, (10%), in a gas mixture with B (65%), and inert, I, (25%) at 165 °C and 5 atm needs to be reduced to 0.1%. This is going to be accomplished by converting the A into Z according to reaction (1). An adiabatic, steady-state CSTR is going to be used. The rate expression is given in equation (2) where the pre-exponential factor is 1.37 x 105 m3 mol-1 min-1 and the activation energy is 11,100 cal mol-1. The heat of reaction is constant and equal to -7200 cal mol-1, and the heat capacities of A, B, I, and Z are equal to 7.6, 8.2, 4.3, and 13.8 cal mol-1 K-1, respectively.

To summarize the assignment, I’ll assign an appropriate variable symbol to each quantity provided in the assignment narrative. This is a gas phase system, so I’ll add values of the ideal gas law in both energy and pressure-volume units. I’ll use a subscripted “in” to designate inlet quantities, and I won’t use an extra subscript for outlet quantities.\n\n\n\n\n12.7.2.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(y_{A,in}\\) = 0.1, \\(y_{Bin}\\) = 0.65, \\(y_{I,in}\\) = 0.25, \\(T_{in}\\) = 165 °C, \\(P\\) = 5 atm, \\(y_A\\) = 0.001, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 1.37 x 105 m3 mol-1 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 11,100 cal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = –7200 cal mol-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\) = 7.6 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,B}\\) = 8.2 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,I}\\) = 4.3 cal mol-1 K-1, and \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Z}\\) = 13.8 cal mol-1 K-1, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1 = 8.206 x 10-5 m3 atm mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Adiabatic, steady-state CSTR\nQuantities of Interest: \\(\\tau\\) and \\(T\\)\n\n\n12.7.2.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to generate the reactor design equations. This reactor operates at steady-state and is adiabatic. The reactor design equations always include at least one mole balance. I’ll simply write a mole balance for every reagent. The general form of the steady-state CSTR mole balance design equation is given in Equation 6.31. In this assignment there is only one reaction, so the summation reduces to a single term. There isn’t any Z in the feed, so \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\) is equal to zero.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\cancelto{\\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j}\n\\]\nThe reactor isn’t isothermal, so I can’t solve the mole balances independently of an energy balance on the reacting fluid. The general form of the steady-state energy balance is given in Equation 6.32. This reactor is adiabatic, so the rate of heat exchange, \\(\\dot{Q}\\), is zero. There aren’t any shafts or moving boundaries doing work, so assuming the energy associated with mixing the gases is negligible, the power term, \\(\\dot{W}\\), is also equal to zero. The heat capacities are constants, so they can be taken outside of the integral, making it trivial to evaluate the integral. Finally, there is only one reaction taking place, so the final summation reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n0 = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = -\\left(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\hat{C}_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_{B,in}\\hat{C}_{p,B} + \\dot{n}_{I,in}\\hat{C}_{p,I} \\right)\\left(T - T_{in}\\right) - Vr_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nThere isn’t a heat exchange fluid, so a heat exchange fluid energy balance is not needed. The design equations as written here are already in the form of residual expressions, so they are ready for numerical solution.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nResidual expressions corresponding to mole balance design equations for A, B, I, and Z are presented in equations (3) - (6). The energy balance on the reacting gas is given as a residual expression in equation (7).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{A,in} - \\dot n_A - Vr_1 = \\epsilon_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{B,in} - \\dot n_B - Vr_1 = \\epsilon_2 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{I,in} - \\dot n_I = \\epsilon_3 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot n_Z + Vr_1 = \\epsilon_4 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = -\\left(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\hat{C}_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_{B,in}\\hat{C}_{p,B} + \\dot{n}_{I,in}\\hat{C}_{p,I} \\right)\\left(T - T_{in}\\right) - Vr_1 \\Delta H_1 = \\epsilon_5 \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point I have five reactor design equations, so I can solve them to find five unknown quantities. Usually I solve for the outlet molar flow rates and the outlet temperature, but in this assignment I’m given the outlet mole fraction of A. That means that I can calculate the outlet molar flow of A using its outlet mole fraction. Also, the assignment is to find the space time, but the space time doesn’t appear in the design equations. However, the volume does appear in the design equations, it is unknown, and it is related to the space time. So I’ll solve the five reactor design equations for \\(V\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_I\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\), and then, knowing \\(V\\), I’ll calculate the space time using Equation 6.1.\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{V}{\\dot V_{in}}\n\\]\nTo do that, I’ll need to know the inlet volumetric flow rate, but the inlet volumetric flow rate isn’t given in the assignment. Looking more carefully at the assignment summary, I see that all of the given and known quantities are intensive. That is, they do not establish the size of the system. In that situation I am free to choose the value of one extensive quantity as a basis for my calculations. I’ll use an inlet volumetric flow rate of 1 m3 min-1 as my basis. That way I’ll be able to calculate the space time after solving the design equations for \\(V\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_I\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\).\nIn order to solve the ATEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the residuals for each guess and provide an initial guess. I’ll need to evaluate the residuals each time a new guess for the solution is generated. At that point, values for each of the unknowns (\\(V\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_I\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\)) will be available along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the residual expressions. Looking at equations (3) through (7) I see that for this assignment I’ll need to calculate the inlet molar flow rates, \\(\\dot{n}_{i,in}\\), the outlet molar flow rate of A, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), and the rate, \\(r_1\\).\nHaving chosen an inlet volumetric flow rate, I can use the ideal gas law to calculate the inlet molar flow rates. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, and I sum to 1, so the inlet mole fraction of Z must equal zero.\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{i,in} = y_{i,in}\\frac{P\\dot{V}_{in}}{RT}\n\\]\nThe outlet molar flow rate of A can be calculated using its known outlet mole fraction.\n\\[\ny_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_B + \\dot{n}_I + \\dot{n}_Z} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\dot{n}_A = \\frac{\\left(\\dot{n}_B + \\dot{n}_I + \\dot{n}_Z\\right)y_A}{1-y_A}\n\\]\nThe rate can be calculated using equaion (2), but to do that I must calculate the rate coefficient and the outlet concentrations of A and B.

Very often, CSTRs are used to process liquid feeds. Assuming the liquids to be ideal, incompressible solutions makes the volumetric flow rate constant; there is no expansion or contraction of the fluid. The concentrations that are substituted into the rate expressions are simply the outlet molar flow rate divided by the outlet volumetric flow rate, and since the volumetric flow rate is constant, the inlet and outlet volumetric flow rates are equal.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{i}}{\\dot{V}} \\qquad \\underset{\\text{liquids}}{\\Rightarrow} \\qquad \\frac{\\dot{n}_{i}}{\\dot{V}_{in}}\n\\]\nGeneraly, for gas phase reacting fluids, the inlet and outlet volumetric flow rates are not equal. Setting the concentration equal to the molar flow rate divided by the inlet volumetric flow rate of a gas will result in an incorrect solution of the reactor design equations. Instead the volumetric flow rate must be calculated using the ideal gas law as was done in equations (13) and (14).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7.3 Maximizing Conversion for a Reversible Reaction in a Steady-State CSTR\nTo produce Z, equation (1), reagent A will be fed to a 0.5 m3 adiabatic, steady state CSTR at 70 mol s-1 and B will be fed at 1500 mol s-1 giving a total liquid feed rate of 40 L s-1.

I always just write a mole balance on every reagent. The general form of the steady-state CSTR mol balance is given in Equation 6.31.

In order to solve the ATEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the residuals for each guess and provide an initial guess.\nI’ll need to evaluate the residuals each time a new guess for the solution is generated.

I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the residuals expressions.\nLooking at equations (4) through (7), I see that the only thing I’ll need to calculate is the rate, \\(r_1\\). I can use equation (2) for that, but that means I’ll also need to calculate \\(k_1\\), \\(K_1\\), and the outlet concentrations of A, B, and Z. (I’ll be choosing a range of values for \\(T_{in}\\) and solving the design equations for each value in the range, so \\(T_{in}\\) will be known.) The rate coefficient can be calculated using the outlet temperature in the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8. The equilibrium constant can be calculated using equation (3).

The conversion is plotted as a function of the feed temperature in Figure 12.5. The maximum conversion, 33.1 %, occurs at an inlet temperature of 94.7 °C. When that inlet temperature is used, the outlet temperature is 110 °C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Variation in the conversion as the inlet temperature changes.\n\n\n\nQualitative Analysis\nThe results shown in Figure 12.5 are reasonable. For any feed temperature heat will be released by reaction leading to an outlet temperature that is greater than the inlet temperature. The rate expression, equation (2), contains two temperature dependent terms, namely the rate coefficient, \\(k_1\\), and the equilibrium constant, \\(K_1\\). The rate coefficient increases as the temperature increases, but the equilibrium constant decreases. Looking at the rate expression, the rate will increase as \\(k_1\\) increases. As \\(K_1\\) decreases with increasing temperature, the second term in parentheses increases. Because the second term is being subtracted from 1, the term in parentheses decreases. To summarize, as the temperature increases, \\(k_1\\) increases and this alone would cause the rate to increase. As the temperature increases \\(K_1\\) decreases, and this alone would cause the rate to decrease.\nAt lower feed temperatures, the reaction has not come close to equilibrium. As the temperature increases, the effect upon \\(k_1\\) predominates and the rate increases. Consequently, the conversion increases. At intermediate feed temperatures, the reaction begins to approach thermodynamic equilibrium. As the temperature increases both \\(k_1\\) and \\(K_1\\) affect the rate, and consequently the rate, and by extension, the conversion, rises less steeply. At some temperature, the effects of \\(k_1\\) and \\(K_1\\) on the rate become equal and the rate (and conversion) reaches a maximum. At still higher temperatures, the reaction becomes close to thermodynamic equilibrium. At this point, as the temperature increases, the effect of \\(K_1\\) predominates and the rate, while still positive, decreases with increasing temperature. Consequently, as the rate decreases, the conversion decreases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7.4 Multiple Steady States in a CSTR\nAn adiabatic, steady-state CSTR with a volume of 500 cm3 is going to be used to convert A and B into Y and Z.

In this assignment, I need to find three different solutions of the design equations. For reasons I won’t go into here (but related to the fact that the middle steady state is unstable), I expect the middle steady state to be the most difficult to find.\nI expect the molar flow rates of A and B to decrease, the molar flow rates of Y and Z to increase, and the temperature to increase (exothermic reaction in an adiabatic reactor). As a first guess, I’ll use small values for the changes. Once I’ve converged to the low temperature steady state, I’ll increase the temperature guess by 100 °C and also increase the guesses for the changes in the molar flow rates. I may need to revise the guesses, but eventually I should be able to get the ATE solver to converge to the high temperature steady state.\nTo find the middle temperature steady state, I’ll start by using the average of the high and low temperature steady states. If the solver does not converge to the middle steady state, I’ll vary the temperature guess a small amount until I find the middle steady state.\nFor each of the steady states, I can calculate the conversion using its definition.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest\nSolving the reactor design equations yields \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\) for each of the three steady states.

The steady-state outlet temperatures and conversions are presented in Table 12.1.

In most cases, however, an engineer won’t know whether or not multiple steady states are possible. It is critically important to know when multiple steady states exist so that the desired steady state can be identified and appropriate start-up procedures can be developed to reach it.\nOne way to determine whether multiple steady states are possible is to plot the outlet temperature as a function of the inlet temperature. The “trick” that makes this easier to do is to choose a range of outlet temperatures and then solve the reactor design equations to find the outlet molar flow rates and the inlet temperature corresponding to each outlet temperature. As noted in Section 12.5, for each outlet temperature there is only one inlet temperature.\n\n\n\nThe reactor model was used to calculate the steady-state outlet temperature and the steady-state conversion as functions of the feed temperature for this reactor. The results are presented in Figure 12.6 and Figure 12.7. In both cases the curves exhibit the “S” shape described in Section 12.5. The dashed sections of the (black) curves are unstable steady states (see Section 12.6.1). The ignition point occurs at an inlet temperature of 90.5 °C and is shown as a solid red line. The extinction point occurs at an inlet temperature of 3.9 °C and is indicated by a dashed red line.\nThe outlet temperature corresponding to the ignition point is 103 °C, and the outlet temperature corresponding to the extinction point is 188 °C. The reactor should not be operated at temperatures close to these points because it would be highly sensitive to small changes in any of the reactor operating parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: Steady-state outlet temperature as a function of inlet temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Steady-state conversion as a function of inlet temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7.5 Start-Up of a CSTR\nA 10 gal CSTR with a 1.25 gal shell is going to be used for the conversion of A and B according to reactions (1), (2), and (3). Both the reactor and the shell are perfectly mixed. Before flow into the reactor begins, it is filled with a solution containing only B at a concentration of 3 mol gal-1 and a temperature of 20 °C, while the shell is filled with cooling water at 20 °C. To start up the reactor, 0.5 gal min-1 of a feed consisting of a liquid solution of A (7.5 mol gal-1) and B (3 mol gal-1) at 50 °C starts flowing into the reactor and simultaneously cooling water at 20 °C starts flowing into the shell at a rate of 250 g min-1. The heat transfer coefficient between the reactor and the shell is 190 cal ft-2 min-1 K-1 and the heat transfer area is 4 ft2. The entire process operates at a constant pressure of 1 atm.\nEach of the reactions is first order in the concentration of A and first order in the concentration of B. The pre-exponential factors, activation energies and heats of reaction are listed in the table below. The heats of reaction may be taken to be constant. The cooling water has a constant density of 1 g cm-3 and a constant heat capacity of 1 cal g-1 K-1. The reacting fluid may be assumed to have a constant heat capacity of 1600 cal gal-1 K-1.\nPlot the temperature of the reacting fluid, the temperature of the cooling water in the jacket, and the concentration of B in the reactor during the first 30 minutes of the start-up process.\n\nReaction Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaction\nk0 (gal mol-1 min-1)\nE (kcal mol-1)\n\\(\\Delta H\\) (kcal mol-1)\n\n\n\n\n1\n4.3 x 108\n14.2\n-11.0\n\n\n2\n2.7 x 108\n16.1\n-11.6\n\n\n3\n3.9 x 108\n14.8\n-12.1\n\n\n\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow W + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow X + Z \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves the start-up of a cooled CSTR. Start-up is always a transient process. To summarize this assignment, I will assign an appropriate variable symbol to each quantity mentioned in the assignment. Transient CSTR involve changes in molar flow rates that occur both spatically and temporily (over time). I’ll use a subscripted “in” to denote quantities associates with the feed into the reactor and I’ll use a subscripted “0” to denote the initial values of quantities.\n\n\n\n\n12.7.5.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(V\\) = 10 gal, \\(V_{ex}\\) = 1.25 gal, \\(C_{B,0}\\) = 3 mol gal-1, \\(T_0\\) = (20 + 273.15) K, \\(\\dot V_{in}\\) = 0.5 gal min-1, \\(C_{A,in}\\) = 7.5 mol gal-1, \\(C_{B,in}\\) = 3 mol gal-1, \\(T_{in}\\) = (50 + 273.15) K, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) = \\(T_{ex,in}\\) = = (20 + 273.15) K, \\(\\dot m_{ex,in}\\) = 250 g min-1, \\(U\\) = 190 cal ft-2 min-1 K-1, \\(A\\) = 4 ft2, \\(P\\) = 1 atm, \\(\\rho_{ex}\\) = 1 g cm-3, \\(\\tilde C_{p,ex}\\) = 1 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\breve C_p\\) = 1600 cal gal-1 K-1, \\(k_{0,j}\\) in Table 1, \\(E_j\\) in Table 1, \\(\\Delta H_j\\) in Table 1, \\(t_f\\) = 30 min, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Transient, cooled CSTR\nQuantities of Interest: \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T_{ex}\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(C_B\\left(t\\right)\\) as graphs.\n\n\n12.7.5.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to generate the reactor design equation needed to model this reaction. I’ll start by writing a mole balance on each reagent, A, B, W, X, Y, and Z. The general form of the transient CSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.24. This reactor is full at the start of the transient, and a steady flow of liquid into the reactor is maintained throughout. Assuming the liquid to be an incompressible, ideal solution, this means that the reacting fluid volume and the outlet volumetric flow rate are both constant. Because they are constant, their time derivatives are equal to zero. Only A and B flow into the reactor so \\(\\dot{n}_{W,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{X,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\) are equal to zero. There are three reactions taking place, so the summation expands to three terms.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} + \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}} - \\frac{\\dot n_iV}{\\dot V^2}\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{d \\dot V}{dt}} = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\cancelto{\\nu_{i,1}r_1 + \\nu_{i,2}r_2 + \\nu_{i,3}r_3}{\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j}\n\\]\nWhen these IVODEs are solved numerically, it will be necessary to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. That will be straightforward if they are written in the form of derivative expressions (see Appendix J), so I’ll multiply both sides of the equations by the volumetric flow rate and divide both sides by the reacting fluid volume.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{V} \\left(\\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V\\left(\\nu_{i,1}r_1 + \\nu_{i,2}r_2 + \\nu_{i,3}r_3\\right)\\right)\n\\]\nThe reactor is not isothermal, so the mole balances cannot be solved independently, and an energy balance on the reacting fluid must be added to the design equations. The general form of the transient energy balance on the reacting fluid in a CSTR is given in Equation 6.25. As previously noted, the time derivative of the reacting fluid volume is zero. The pressure is also constant, so its time-derivative is also zero. There are no shafts or moving boundaries that do work, so \\(\\dot{W}\\) is also equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) &\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dP}{dt}} - P\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}} = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} \\\\&- \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe volumetric heat capacity of the reacting fluid as a whole is given, so it can be used in place of the molar heat capacities. The volumetric heat capacity is a constant, so it can be brought outside of the integral and the integral can be evaluated. Also, the final summation can be expanded to three terms, one for each of the three reactions.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\cancelto{\\dot{V}\\breve{C}_p}{\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right)} \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{\\dot{V}\\breve{C}_p\\left(T - T_{in}\\right)}{\\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT} - V\\cancelto{r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2 + r_3 \\Delta H_3}{\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\]\nAgain, evaluation of the derivative will be facilitated if the energy balance is written as a derivative expression.\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{Q} - \\dot V_{in} \\breve C_p \\left(T - T_{in}\\right) - V \\left( r_1\\Delta H_1 + r_2\\Delta H_2 + r_3\\Delta H_3 \\right)}{V \\breve C_p }\n\\]\nFinally, this reactor is cooled using chilled water. The inlet temperature of the water is known, but not the temperature within the jacket. Therefore, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid must also be included in the reactor design equations. In this system, the cooling water only exchanges sensible heat, so the general form of the exchange fluid energy balance is given by Equation 6.2. The exchange fluid heat capacity is constant, so it can be taken outside of the integral, and the integral can be evaluated. Dividing both sides of this equation by \\(\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\) will put it in the form of a derivative expression.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, W, X, Y, and Z are presented in equations (4) through (9). The energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (10). An energy balance on the heat exchange fluid is shown in equation (11).\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot n_A}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot V}{V}\\left(\\dot n_{A,in} - \\dot n_A - V\\left(r_1 + r_2 + r_3\\right)\\right) \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot n_B}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot V}{V}\\left(\\dot n_{B,in} - \\dot n_B - V\\left(r_1 + r_2 + r_3\\right)\\right) \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot n_W}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot V}{V}\\left(- \\dot n_W + Vr_1\\right) \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot n_Z}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot V}{V}\\left(- \\dot n_Z + V\\left(r_1 + r_2 + r_3\\right)\\right) \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot n_X}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot V}{V}\\left(- \\dot n_X + Vr_2\\right) \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot n_Y}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot V}{V}\\left(- \\dot n_Y + Vr_3\\right) \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{Q} - \\dot V_{in} \\breve C_p \\left(T - T_{in}\\right) - V \\left( r_1\\Delta H_1 + r_2\\Delta H_2 + r_3\\Delta H_3 \\right)}{V \\breve C_p } \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = \\frac{-\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex} \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right)}{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex }\\tilde C_{p,ex}} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are eight IVODEs and they contain eight dependent variables, so there is no need to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable. I can define \\(t=0\\) to be the instant that the flows start. The initial values are then equal to the outlet molar flow rates and temperatures at that instant. Initially the reactor contains only B, so when the flow starts that is the only reagent flowing out of the reactor.

The reacting fluid temperature, exchange fluid temperature and concentration of B during the first 30 min of startup are shown in Figures 12.8, 12.9, and 12.10. All three quantities appear to be approaching steady-state values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Reacting Fluid Temperature During the First 30 Minutes of Startup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Cooling Water Temperature During the First 30 Minutes of Startup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.10: Concentration of Reagent B During the First 30 Minutes of Startup\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to start-up a reactor. Here the reactor was filled with one reactant and the feed flow was initiated. Another option would be to charge the reactor with the feed and let it react in BSTR mode until the composition and temperature are near their steady-state values, and then start the flow. The start-up procedure that is ultimately used will likely be chosen, at least in part, on the basis of economics. For example, in this assignment the reactor operated for 30 minutes and still hadn’t quite reached steady-state. During that time it was not producing the intended product. If there is no use for that partially reacted product, of if the reactants are relatively expensive, the alternative method described above might be preferred because it wastes less feed and generates less partially reacted product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7.6 Perturbations from an Unstable Steady State and Near Ignition and Extinction Points\nExample 12.7.4 showed conditions where three steady states are possible when reaction (1) takes place in an adiabatic CSTR. Specifically, the reactor volume is 500 cm3 and the feed is 1.0 cm3 s-1 of a solution containing 0.015 mol cm-3 each of A and B at 50 °C. The heat capacity is 0.35 cal g-1 K-1, and the density is 0.93 gm cm-3. The heat of reaction is -20 kJ mol-1, and the rate is given by equation (2) with the pre-exponential factor equal to 3.24 x 1012 cm3 mol-1 s-1 and the activation energy equal to 105.0 kJ mol-1. The steady-state conversions were 0.03%, 39.9%, and 97.5%, and the corresponding outlet temperatures were 50, 183, and 265 °C.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_AC_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe outlet temperature for this reactor was plotted as a function of the feed temperature in Figure 12.6. That graph is reproduced here as Figure 12.11, with three steady states highlighted as red dots labeled “u,” “ign,” and “ext.” Steady state u is the unstable steady state from Example 12.7.4. Steady state ign (\\(T_{in}\\) = 89 °C, \\(f_A\\) = 3.2%, and \\(T\\) = 96 °C) is just below the ignition point at \\(T_{in}\\) = 90.5 °C, and steady state ext (\\(T_{in}\\) = 6 °C, \\(f_A\\) = 88.1%, and \\(T\\) = 200 °C) is just above the extinction point at \\(T_{in}\\) = 3.9 °C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.11: Steady-state temperatures prior to perturbation.\n\n\n\nTo show that steady state u is unstable, plot the outlet temperature vs. time if the temperature of a CSTR at steady state u is perturbed from 138 to 140 °C holding all of the inputs constant.\nTo show that there is an ignition point at \\(T_{in}\\) = 90.5 °C, plot the outlet temperature vs. time if the inlet temperature of a CSTR at steady state ign is increased from 89 to 91 °C and held there.\nTo show that there is an extinction point at \\(T_{in}\\) = 3.9 °C, plot the outlet temperature vs. time if the inlet temperature of a CSTR at steady state ext is increased from 6 to 3 °C and held there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an isolated reactor modeling problem involving an adiabatic CSTR. The assignment asks me to calculate how the temperature will change over time following a sudden change to a parameter, so the reactor is not at steady state, it is transient.\nI’m asked to analyze 3 different scenarios: one involving perturbation from an unstable steady state, one involving perturbation from a steady state close to the ignition point, and one involving perturbation from a steady state close to the extinction point. For quantities that change from one scenario to the next I will use a subscripted \\(u\\) to denote the unstable steady state, \\(ign\\) to denote the steady state close to the ignition point, and \\(ext\\) to denote the steady state close to the extinction point.\nI’ll use a subscripted \\(in\\) to denote reactor inlet values and a subscripted \\(0\\) to denote initial values. I’ll begin by summarizing the assignment using appropriate variable symbols for all quantities.\n\n\n\n\n12.7.6.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(V\\) = 500 cm3, \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) = 1.0 cm3 s-1, \\(C_{A,in}\\) = 0.015 mol cm-3, \\(C_{B,in}\\) = 0.015 mol cm-3, \\(T_{in,u}\\) = 50 °C, \\(T_{in,ign}\\) = 91 °C, \\(T_{in,ext}\\) = 3 °C, \\(T_{0,u}\\) = 140 °C, \\(T_{0,ign}\\) = 96 °C, \\(T_{0,ext}\\) = 200 °C, \\(f_{A,0,u}\\) = 39.9%, \\(f_{A,0,ign}\\) = 3.2%, \\(f_{A,0,ext}\\) = 88.1%, \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\) = 0.35 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\rho\\) = 0.93 gm cm-3, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -20 kJ mol-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 3.24 x 1012 cm3 mol-1 s-1, \\(E_1\\) = 105.0 kJ mol-1, and \\(R\\) = 8.314 J mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Transient, adiabatic CSTR\nQuantities of Interest: \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\) following perturbations from three steady states, as graphs.\n\n\n12.7.6.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis involves a transient, adiabatic CSTR. To model it I will need mole balances and an energy balance on the reacting fluid. The general form of the transient CSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.24. In all three cases, the volumetric flow rate and the reacting fluid volume do not change, so their time derivatives are equal to zero. Only A and B flow into the reactor, so \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\) and \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\) will equal zero. There is one reaction, so the summation reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} + \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}} - \\frac{\\dot n_iV}{\\dot V^2}\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{d \\dot V}{dt}} = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\cancelto{\\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j}\n\\]\nThe general form of the transient CSTR reacting fluid energy balance is presente d in Equation 6.25. As already noted, the reacting fluid volume is constant and its derivative is zero. The same is true of the pressure. Furthermore there is no heat exchange and negligible work.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) &\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dP}{dt}} - P\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}} = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q }- \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} \\\\&- \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThe sensible heats can be expressed in terms of the given gravimetric heat capacity. That heat capacity is constant. It can be taken outside of the integral, and the integral can be evaluated. The summation over the reactions reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\cancelto{\\dot{V}\\rho\\tilde{C}_p}{\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right)} \\frac{dT}{dt} = - \\cancelto{\\tilde{C}_p \\rho \\dot{V}_{in}\\left( T - T_{in}\\right)}{\\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT} - V\\cancelto{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\]\nThe mole balances can be written as derivative expression by multiplying both sides of the equations by \\(\\dot{V}\\) and dividing by \\(V\\). The energy balance can be written as a derivative expression by dividing both sides by \\(V\\tilde{C}_p\\rho\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z are presented in equations (3) - (6). The energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (7).\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_A}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{V}\\left(\\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A - V r_1\\right) \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_B}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{V}\\left(\\dot{n}_{B,in} - \\dot{n}_B - V r_1\\right) \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_Y}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{V}\\left( - \\dot{n}_Y + V r_1\\right) \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_Z}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{V}\\left( - \\dot{n}_Z + V r_1\\right) \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{ - \\tilde{C}_p \\rho \\dot{V}_{in} \\left( T - T_{in}\\right) - V r_1 \\Delta H_1}{V\\tilde{C}_p \\rho} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations consist of five IVODEs and they contain five dependent variables, so there isn’t any need to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable.\nInitial values and a stopping criterion will be needed when solving the IVODEs. I can define \\(t=0\\) to be the instant that the system was perturbed. The initial values are then the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, Y, and Z and the outlet temperature at that instant. These will be different for each of the three analyses. I can choose a final time that is large enough to show where the transient will end.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 12.3: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the reactor design equations, (3) through (7) for scenario \\(x\\) (\\(u\\), \\(ign\\), or \\(ext\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_f\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,0,x}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_B\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{B,0,x}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Y,0,x}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Z,0,x}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_{0,x}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 12.3.\nI’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables, \\(t\\), \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\), will be known along with the given and known constants.

The outlet concentraions of A and B needed to calculate the rate can be calculated using the defining equation for concentration. Because the fluid is an ideal, incompressible liquid, the inlet and outlet volumetric flow rates will be equal.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{V}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{V}_{in}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,in} = \\dot{V}_{in} C_{A,in} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{B,in} = \\dot{V}_{in} C_{B,in} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nk_1 = k_{0,1} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_!}{RT} \\right)} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{\\dot n_A}{\\dot{V}_{in}} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_B = \\frac{\\dot n_B}{\\dot{V}_{in}} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to calculate the initial and final values in Table 12.3.

Figure 12.12 shows the temperature as a function of time following perturbation from the unstable steady state at temperature of 138 °C to a temperature of 140 °C holding all of the inputs constant. Since none of the reactor inputs changed, the temperature would have returned to 138 °C had that been a stable steady state. Instead, the figure shows that the temperature increases to 265 °C, whereupon it becomes stable. Referring back to Example 12.7.4, 265 °C is the high temperature steady state for that reactor. This provides a rigorous confirmation of the argument made in Section 12.6.1 that the middle temperature steady state is unstable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.12: Reacting fluid temperature following a 2 °C perturbation from an unsteady state.\n\n\n\nThe ign steady state in Figure 12.11 is just below the ignition point. Figure 12.13 shows how the temperature changes over time following an increase of the feed temperature from 89 to 91 °C. Prior to the change the outlet temperature was 99 °C. The figure shows that increasing the feed temperature by 2 °C, causes the outlet temperature increase by 210 °C to 309 °C. For approximately 2 h, the outlet temperature increased slowly, but then it jumped almost instantly to the final temperature.\nA rapid temperature rise like that shown in the figure is unsafe. In a real reactor, as opposed to the idealized model, the near vertical slope of the temperature vs. time curve might correspond to an explosion. In any case, this scenario must be avoided. To safely operate this reactor, the start-up procedure must bring the reactor to a high temperature steady state while keeping the feed temperature well below the ignition point of 90.5 °C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.13: Reacting fluid temperature following a 1 °C increase in the feed temperature.\n\n\n\nThe ext steady state in Figure 12.11 is just above the extinction point. Figure 12.14 shows that if the feed temperature drops from 6 to 3 °C, the reactor temperature will drop from 200 to 3 °C. While this doesn’t pose a safety risk like ignition does, it essentially stops the reaction so that the process is no longer producing any Y and Z. Clearly this is not desirable, and to prevent if from happening, the reactor should not operate at a steady state close to the extinction point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.14: Reacting fluid temperature following a 1 °C decrease in the feed temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.",

    "text": "13.1 PFR Characteristics\nThe distincitve characteristics of PFRs were summarized in Chapter 6, and they are presented in more detail in Appendix H. The biggest difference between PFRs and stirred tanks lies in the mixing. Stirred tanks are perfectly mixed at all times, so there are never any spatial variations of composition or temperature within the reactor. In contrast, the composition and temperature vary continuously along the length of a PFR as the reacting fluid flows through it. More specifically, as illustrated in Figure H.1, it is assumed that the fluid velocity in the axial distance does not vary in the radial direction. As a consequence, the fluid can be thought of as differentially thick disks that move from the reactor inlet to the outlet. There is perfect mixing in the radial direction (i. e. within each differentially thick disk) an no mixing at all in the axial direction (i. e. between disks).\nAnother difference between PFRs and CSTRs is that the pressure of the reacting fluid in a PFR can decrease as the fluid flows from the inlet to the outlet. When analyzing CSTRs it is assumed that pressure changes are negligible both between inlet and outlet and between the top and bottom of the fluid within the reactor.\nIn PFRs, heat is exchanged through the reactor walls. Commonly there is a concentric tube surrounding the reactor tube with heat exchange fluid flowing through the annular space. Alternatively, there may be many reactor tubes that all pass through a larger shell while heat exchange fluid flows through the shell. In some applications PFR tubes pass though a firebox within which some fuel is burned. In this situation the flue gases are the heat exchange fluid, and any PFR tubes that are within line of sight of the combustion flame are additionally heated radiantly. Reaction Engineering Basics only considers heat exchange with a fliud in a shell surrounding the PFR tube (see Chapter 6).\nBeing continuous flow reactors, PFRs can operate at steady-state or in a transient mode. At the minimum, transient operation occurs when the PFR is started up and shut down. Transient behavior will occur whenever a reactor input changes. Those changes can involve the flow rate, the feed composition, the feed temperature, the feed pressure, the heat exchange fluid flow rate, and the heat exchange fluid inlet temperature. Due to the nature of plug flow, PFR transients typically only last as long as it takes the reacting fluid to flow from the reactor inlet to its outlet.\nPFRs are well-suited to high throughput production. They can also be used for reactions that require solid catalyst particles. The absence of axial mixing can be an advantage because, unlike a CSTR, the reactants are not immediately diluted due to mixing with the fluid already present in the reactor. As a consequence, the concentration of reactant is high at the inlet. High reactant concentration typically results in a high reaction rate and a smaller reactor volume.\nThe absence of axial mixing can also be a disadvantage if the reaction is exothermic with limited or no heat removal. Unlike a CSTR, where the feed is instantly heated to the outlet temperature upon entering the reactor, fluid enters a PFR at the feed temperature, and its temperature rises continuously as it flows through the reactor. The lower temperatures near the inlet typically result in a lower rate, and therefore a larger reactor is needed to accomplish a given extent of conversion.\nAnother disadvangage of PFRs is the fixed heat transfer area. As noted, heat exchange with a PFR is typically limited to occur through the reactor wall. Unlike CSTRs, it isn’ feasible to add coiled tubes containing flowing heat exchange fluid within the PFR tube. Similarly, circulating the reacting fluid through an external heat exchanger is not practical. In some situations it is possible to break one long PFR into several shorter PFRs with additional cooling between the shorter lengths of reactor.",

When a PFR operates at steady state, the composition, temperature and pressure are all constant over time at any one axial position in the reactor. The temperature pressure and composition will be different at a different location, but at that location they again will be constant over time. Put differently, the steady-state composition, pressure and temperature in a PFR will vary spatitially, but not temporally.\nPFRs must operate in transient modes when they are started up and shut down, and they will also undergo transient operation if any reactor input changes. The absence of axial mixing can result in “odd” transients that intuitively seem to be incorrect. This aspect of transient PFR operation is discussed later in the chapter.",

    "text": "13.3 Qualitative Analysis of Steady-State Reaction in a PFR\nChapter 12 pointed out that in a continuous reactor, the amount of time during which reaction occurs is equal to the amount of time that the fluid spends in the reactor. As a consequence, when qualitatively analyzing the performance of a continuous reactor, the effects of small changes in space time are considered. When that is done, the qualitative analysis of a PFR is essentially the same as a BSTR except that the space time is used instead of elapsed clock time.\nIndeed, there is a relationship between BSTR reaction time and PFR space time. As already noted, each differential, disk-shaped element of fluid that enters a PFR flows through the reactor without mixing with the fluid that entered before it or the fluid that enters after it. Furthermore, being differentially thin and with perfect radial mixing in a PFR, that thin disk is essentially a small batch reactor that moves from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet, as illustrated in Figure 13.2. From the perspective of that thin disk, the reaction time is equal to the time it takes to flow from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Analogy between reaction time in a BSTR and space time in a PFR.\n\n\n\nFor incompressible liquid phase systems, the analogy of Figure 13.2 is exact. For gases, the volume of the thin disk may change as it moves through the reactor due to changes in temperature, pressure or total moles. The space time is defined in terms of the inlet volumetric flow rate, so it does not account for expansion or contraction of the thin disk. Nonetheless, for the purposes of a qualitative analysis the expansion effect is not important.\nSection 9.3 presented an approach to qualitative analysis of a BSTR wherein the effects of small increments in reaction time were assessed. The same procedure can be used for PFR, substituting the space time for the reaction time. Basically the changes experienced as a function of reaction time in a BSTR are the same as the changes experienced upon progressing from a PFR’s inlet to its outlet.",

Transient analysis of PFRs is not presented in Reaction Engineering Basics except for the special case, discussed later in the chapter, where a front propagates through the reactor.\nWhen a PRF is operating at steady state, the time derivatives are equal to zero and the partial derivatives become ordinary derivatives.

As a consequence it is sometimes necessary to add a differential equation or eliminate a dependent variable in order to solve the design equations.

    "section": "13.5 PFR Reaction Fronts",
    "text": "13.5 PFR Reaction Fronts\nAccording to the ideal PFR model fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial direction, but it does not mix at all in the axial direction. Furthermore, the velocity in the axial direction does not vary across the reactor tube. Figures H.1 and 13.2 show that with these assumptions the fluid flow through the reactor can be envisioned as differentially thick disks that move through the reactor one after the other. These disks never mix with the disk ahead of them or with the disk behind them.\nUnder certain conditions, these assumptions can result in transient behavior where a “front” moves through the reactor. Specifically if the feed temperature or the feed composition (but not the feed flow rate) changes abruptly, none of the fluid already in the reactor is affected. This is illustrated in Figure 13.3 for the situation where there isn’t any reaction taking place within the reactor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Development of a front in a PFR following an abrupt change in the feed temperature or composition. Gray shading indicates fluid with the temperature and composition prior to the feed change and turquoise indicates fluid with the temperature and composition after the feed change.\n\n\n\nThe figure indicates that there is an abrupt change, i. e. a step-change, in the feed temperature and/or composition that starts the transient response. Notice the sharp interface between the fluid that entered just before the change and the fluid entering to start the transient. That interface is called a “front”. As a result of the plug flow within the reactor, a short while later that front has moved part way through the reactor. It remains as sharp as it was at the instant the change occurred because the fluid just ahead of the front never mixes with the fluid at the beginning of the front.\nThe transient response of the reactor only lasts as long as it takes for the fluid to flow from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet. If the fluid is incompressible, the linear velocity of the front is equal to the volumetric flow rate divided by the cross-sectional area of the tube, Equation 13.6. The position of the front is then equal to the elapsed time since the front began times the velocity, Equation 13.7. The duration of the front is then equal to the time at which the front reaches the reactor outlet at \\(z=L\\), which is equal to the PFR space time, Equation 13.8. Equations 13.6, 13.7, and 13.8 only apply for an incompressible fluid.\n\\[\nv_{front} = \\frac{\\dot{V}}{\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}} = \\frac{4\\dot{V}}{\\pi D^2}\n\\tag{13.6}\\]\n\\[\nz_{front} = v_{front} t = \\frac{4\\dot{V}t}{\\pi D^2}\n\\tag{13.7}\\]\n\\[\nL = \\frac{4\\dot{V}t_{transient}}{\\pi D^2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad t_{transient} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\frac{L}{\\dot{V}} = \\frac{V_{PFR}}{\\dot{V}} = \\tau_{PFR}\n\\tag{13.8}\\]\nThe preceding discussion and Figure 13.3 assumed that no reaction was taking place when the step-change was applied to the feed composition and/or temperature. However, the same reasoning applies if reaction is taking place. The fluid ahead of the front is unaffected by the change in the feed, and similarly, the fluid behind the front is unaffected by the downstream presence of the front. In other words, the composition profile during this type of transient can be calculated using the steady-state PFR design equations.\nWhen a step change in the composition and/or temperature occurs at the inlet to a steady-state PFR, a front will propagate along the length of the reactor. The concentration and temperature profile between the reactor inlet and the front is the steady-state profile for the new feed. The concentration and temperature profile between the front and the reactor outlet is the steady-state profile that existed before the feed change. Example 13.7.5 illustrates the propagation of this type of front.\nIt is important to understand that this approach only applies when the step change in the feed does not affect the fluid already in the reactor. If the feed flow rate changed, or if the exchange fluid flow rate or inlet temperature changed, a front like that described above would not result, and this type of analysis would not be valid.",

    "section": "13.6 Packed Bed PFRs",
    "text": "13.6 Packed Bed PFRs\nOne of the advantages of PFRs is their suitability for heterogeneous catalystic reactions with solid catalysts. The catalyst takes the form of small particles, often cylindrical or spherical in shape with dimensions of the order of 0.25 in. The catalyst particles are highly porous. When they are examined using a microscope, they look similar to a common sponge, with interconnected void spaces throughout their volume.\n\n13.6.1 The Pseudo-Homogeneous PFR Model\nStirred tank reactors are not will suited to reactions that require such catalysts due to the necessity of agitating the fluid to keep it perfectly mixed. Stirring a tank full of solid pellets is not practical. PFRs do not require agitation, so the interior of the reactor can be filled with the catalyst pellets. Screens or other similar means are used to keep the pellets in place, and the reacting fluid flows in the space between the pellets. That space is called the void space. Reactors packed with catalyst pellets as described here are known as packed bed PFRs (assuming they still obey the assumptions of the PFR model).\nThe presence of the packed bed does introduce a few complications. One is that the fluid no longer flows in the axial direction only. Its path must twist and turn so it can flow around the catalyst particles. In many cases, he relatively small amount of non-axial flow does not significantly affect the assumption of a constant velocity in the axial direction in any reactor cross-section, and it does not introduce significant radial mixing. This allows the reactor to be treated as a pseudo-homogeneous PFR, Figure 13.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: In the pseudo-homogeneous PFR model (left), the entire reactor cross section is treated as if it is available for fluid flow (red), while in reality only the space between the (gray) catalyst particles is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.6.2 Normalization of Heterogeneous Catalytic Reaction Rates\nA second complication that arises due to the presence of a packed bed is related to the way the reaction rate is normalized. With homogeneous single-phase reactions, reaction rates are almost always normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid. Indeed, the reactor design equations used throughout Reaction Engineering Basics assume that the rate is normalized per reacting fluid volume, and the reacting fluid volume is essentially equal to the reactor volume.\nRate expressions for heterogeneous catalytic reactions are measured under conditions where concentration gradients (see below) are not significant. The reaction actually occurs on the surface of the catalyst particles. As such, the best way to normalize the rate is per unit catalyst surface area. Nonetheless, the catalyst surface area is not often used to normalize heterogeneous catalytic reaction rates. Most commonly the rates are normalized per unit mass of catalyst.\nA few other normalization factors are sometimes used instead of the catalyst mass or surface area. Sometimes the rate is normalized per unit catalyst bed volume. When the pseudo-homogeneous PFR model is used, the catalyst bed volume is equal to the reactor volume. In other words, a rate normalized per unit catalyst bed volume can be used directly in the reactor design equations. However, the catalyst bed volume is not a very good normalization factor. It depends how tightly the catalyst particles are packed into the bed. That is, one could load the same mass of catalyst pellets into a tubular reactor three times and find three different bed volumes depending on how well the particles had settled into the tube.\nAnother potential normalization factor for heterogeneous catalytic reactions is the volume of pellets only. The pellet volume includes the pores within the individual particles, but not the space between particles. Assuming that the catalyst particles are manufactured with a consistent pore volume, this is an acceptable heterogeneous catalytic reaction rate normalziation factor.\nThe rate expression used to calculate the rate that is substituted into the reactor design equations must be normalized per bed volume. As just noted, this is not a common rate normalization factor due to variations in packing the bed. As such, it is more likely that the rate expression will be normalized per catalyst surface area, per catalyst mass, or per catalyst particle volume, in which case it must be renormalized for use in the design equations.\nWhen the rate is normalized per unit catalyst mass, then the bed density must be measured when the catalyst is loaded into the reactor. Doing so is relatively straightforward. Before the catalyst is loaded into the reactor, the volume into which the catalyst will be loaded can be measured. The total mass of catalyst particles loaded into the reactor can then be measured. The bed density is simply the total mass of catalyst loaded divided by the volume into which it was loaded, Equation 13.9. The rate per catalyst mass can then be renormalized by multiplying it by the bed density, Equation 13.10.\n\\[\n\\rho_{bed} = \\frac{m_{cat}}{V_{bed}}\n\\tag{13.9}\\]\n\\[\nr_{\\text{(per reactor volume)}} = \\rho_{bed} r_{\\text{(per catalyst mass)}}\n\\tag{13.10}\\]\nThere are experimental techniques and instruments for measuring the catalyst’s specific surface area, \\(S_{cat}\\), that is, the surface area per mass of catalyst. When the rate is normalized per catalyst surface area, it can be renormalized simply by multiplying it by the specific surface area to get the rate per catalyst mass, and then applying Equation 13.10, as shown in Equation 13.11.\n\\[\nr_{\\text{(per reactor volume)}} =  \\rho_{bed} S_{cat} r_{\\text{(per catalyst area)}}\n\\tag{13.11}\\]\nWhen the rate is normalized per catalyst particle volume it is convenient to define \\(\\epsilon\\) as the catalyst bed void fraction, Equation 13.12. It is simply the fraction of the bed volume that is not occupied by catalyst particles. Using that definition, an expression for ratio of the particle volume to the bed volume can be generated, Equation 13.13. The rate per particle volume then can be renormalized by multiplying it by this ratio, Equation 13.14.\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\frac{V_{void}}{V_{bed}} = \\frac{V_{void}}{V_{void} + V_{part}}\n\\tag{13.12}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{part}}{V_{bed}} = \\frac{V_{bed} - V_{void}}{V_{bed}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{V_{void}}{V_{bed}}}{1} = 1 - \\epsilon\n\\tag{13.13}\\]\n\\[\nr_{\\text{(per reactor volume)}} = \\left( 1 - \\epsilon \\right) r_{\\text{(per particle volume)}}\n\\tag{13.14}\\]\n\n\n13.6.3 Concentration and Temperature Gradients in Packed Bed PFRs\nThe renormalizations described above all make the implicit assumption that the fluid composition and temperature is uniform in any reactor cross-section. As illustrated Figure 13.5, gradients can form at the interface between two phases, and if one of the phases is porous, gradients can also form within the pores. The middle of the figure shows a cross-section of a packed bed PFR and then zooms in at the bottom of the figure to just show portions of two porous catalyst particles in gray and the fluid in blue. The zoomed in view on the left side shows a uniform blue in the space between the catalyst particles and within the pores of the portions of the two particles that are visible. The uniformity of the blue means that the concentration and temperature are uniformly the same everywhere. This is what the renormalizations assume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Concentration and temperature gradients between the bulk of the fluid in the void space and the surface of the catalyst particles and within the catalyst particles.\n\n\n\nThe zoomed in view shown in the lower right of the figure shows that in fact, there can be temperature and concentration gradient between the bulk of the fluid and the external surface of the catalyst particles and there can be concentration and temperature gradients within the pores of the solid catalyst particles. The blue color in the bulk of the fluid (center of the zoomed view) is uniform, but a gradient in color (representative of concentration and temperture gradients) is seen as the external surface of the two particles are approached. Concentration and temperature gradients between the bulk of the fluid and the surface of the particles are referred to as external gradients. Looking more closely at the figure it can be seen that there is also a gradient within the catalyst particles. These gradients are called internal gradients.\nThe problem this presents is as follows. The concentrations and temperatures that are used in the rate expression and the reactor design equations are the bulk fluid concentrations and temperatures. If there are no gradients, as in the lower left of the figure, this does not cause a problem. However, if there are gradients, then the concentrations and temperature within the catalst particle are different from those in the bulk fluid. In other words, the rate should be calculated using the concentrations and temperatured within the catalyst pores because that is where the reaction is taking place, but instead, the rate is being calculated using the bulk fluid concentrations and temperature.\nThe consequences of using the bulk fluid reactant concentrations in the rate expression when there are gradients present is indicated in Figure 13.6. The upper panel, a in the figure, represents a situation where the catalyst (gray) is not porous, but there are gradients (pink) between the bulk fluid (blue) and the catalyst surface. The region within which the gradients exist (pink) is called the boundary layer. The graph on the right of the top panel plots the concentration of a reactant as a function of the distance into the boundary layer. The concentration of a reactant decreases across the boundary layer. As a consequence, the concentration at the surface of the catalyst, \\(C_{surf}\\), is smaller than the bulk fluid concentration \\(C_{bulk}\\). It is important to realize that no reaction occurs within the boundary layer because the reaction is catalyzed and only occurs on the catalyst surface. The net effect of the external gradient is that the concentration that should be used in the rate expression, \\(C_{surf}\\), is smaller than the bulk fluid concentration \\(C_{bulk}\\). \\(C_{surf}\\) is colored red in the graph to indicate that reaction takes place at that concentration. If the gradient is ignored and the rate is calculated using the bulk concentration, the rate will be larger than it should be, and the predictions made by the reactor design equaions will be incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: The effect of external gradients, internal gradients and both external and internal gradients in concentration upon the rate of reaction. The concentrations at the location were reaction occurs are indicated in red in the graphs.\n\n\n\nThe middle panel, b in Figure 13.6, depicts a situation where there are no external gradients, but the catalyst is porous and the reactant diffuses into a catalyst pore (yellow). Since there isn’t a boundary layer, the concentraton at the external surface of the catalyst is equal to \\(C_{bulk}\\). Being within the pore (and therefore in contact with the catalyst surface), some of the reactant can react as it diffuses into the catalyst pore. The graph to the right of that schematic plots the reactant concentration as a function of the distance into the catalyst particle. The line in the graph is colored red because reaction takes place all along the pore. In other words, the rate should not be evaluated only at \\(C_{bilk}\\), but at a range of concentrations that exist within the catalyst pore. Once again, if the rate is evaluated only at \\(C_{bulk}\\) it will be too large and the results from the reactor design equations will be incorrect.\nWithout going into as much detail, the bottom panel, c in Figure 13.6, depicts a situation where there are both external and internal gradients. The graph to the right of the schematic shows that in this situation the rate again occurs over a range of reactant concentrations, but all of them are less than the bulk fluid concentration. Yet again, if the rate is evaluated only at \\(C_{bulk}\\) it will be too large and the results from the reactor design equations will be incorrect.\nSeveral approaches are possible to account for concentration and temperature gradients associated with heterogeneous catalysts. This chapter does not attempt to present a comprehensive discussion of the topic, but instead considers one of the simplest of situations, illustrating one approach to accounting for concentration gradients. In particular, this chapter only considers concentration gradients (an analogous approach can be used to account for temperature gradients), it only considers a system where Fick’s law describes diffusion and where there is equal and opposite counter-diffusion. Additional limitations will be introduced during the analyses. In short, this chapter is intended to provide an introductory basis for those who wish to learn more through independent study or a second course on reaction engineering.\nAccounting for External Concentration Gradients The flux of a reactant, A, through the boundary layer is usually described in terms of a mass transfer coefficient, \\(k_c\\), where the subscript “c” denotes that the mass transfer coefficient is for use with concentrations as expressed in Equation 13.15. The mass transfer coefficient will depend upon the geometry of the system under consideration, the fluid flow rate and fluid properties. As a consequence, values for mass transfer coefficients are often found from dimensionless correlations. Equation 13.16 is an example of such a correlation for the dimensionless quantity, \\(j_D\\), in terms of the Reynolds number, \\(N_{Re}\\). Equations 13.17 and 13.18 are the defining equations for \\(j_D\\) and \\(N_{Re}\\). Equations 13.15 through 13.18 apply specifically to flow through a packed bed of spherical particles with Reynolds numbers greater than 50. A number of correlations of this type are available; a good mass transfer textbook or chemical engineering handbook should be consulted to find an appropriate correlation for other conditions. Both \\(j_D\\) and \\(N_{Re}\\) may be defined differently, depending on the specific correlation being used.\n\\[\nN_A = k_c\\left( C_{A,bulk} - C_{A,surf} \\right)\n\\tag{13.15}\\]\n\\[\nj_D = 0.61N_{Re}^{-0.41}\n\\tag{13.16}\\]\n\\[\nj_D = \\frac{\\pi D_{tube}^2k_c}{4\\dot{V}}\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho D_A} \\right)^{2/3}\n\\tag{13.17}\\]\n\\[\nN_{Re} = \\frac{2\\dot{V}\\rho}{3\\pi D_{tube}^2 \\mu \\left(1-\\epsilon \\right)D_{part}}\n\\tag{13.18}\\]\nIn general, the concentration of the reactant at the external surface of the catalyst particle is not known. Suppose, however, that the catalyst was not porous as in panel a of Figure 13.6, and that the system had reached steady state. At steady state, the flux given by Equation 13.15 must just equal the rate of reaction on the surface of the catalyst particle. If this weren’t true, reactant would accumulate at the surface, and accumulation does not occur at steady state. Note that the rate expression should be evaluated at \\(C_{A,surf}\\), not \\(C_{A,bulk}\\). Then, for a steady state system, the flux according to Equation 13.15 can be set equal to the rate predicted by the rate expression at \\(C_{A,surf}\\) (assuming the rate expression has been normalized per unit catalyst surface area).\nThe resulting expression can be solved to find the concentration of A at the surface. For example, if the reaction rate is first order in A, this leads to Equation 13.19 for the surface concentration of A. Substitution of Equation 13.19 back into the first order rate expression leads to a rate expression in terms of the bulk fluid concentration of A, Equation 13.20. The rate expression in terms of the bulk fluid concentration still has the appearance of a first order rate expression, Equation 13.21, but the apparent rate coefficient, \\(k^{\\prime}\\), is no longer a simple rate coefficient, Equation 13.22. Thus, if only external concentration gradients were present and the catalyst was non-porous, the rate expression in Equation 13.20 could be used in an ideal reactor model, and the model would correctly account for the external concentration gradient. This analysis only applies if the reaction is first order and the catalyst is non-porous.\n\\[\nC_{A,surf} = \\frac{k_c}{k + k_c}C_{A,bulk}\n\\tag{13.19}\\]\n\\[\n-r_A = \\frac{k k_c}{k + k_c}C_{A,bulk} = \\left( \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k_c} \\right)^{-1}C_{A,bulk}\n\\tag{13.20}\\]\n\\[\n-r_A = k^{\\prime}C_{A,bulk}\n\\tag{13.21}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{k^{\\prime}} = \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k_c}\n\\tag{13.22}\\]\nAccounting for Internal Concentration Gradients Accounting for internal concentration gradients associated with heterogeneous catalysts requires some sort of model for the pore structure of the catalyst. Each catalyst particle is likely to have its own unique pore structure. As a result, it is not practical to attempt to construct an exact physical model for the pore structure. Instead, common approaches are to construct a network of pores that are interconnected at nodes where a specified number of pores meet or to assume straight pores with circular cross sections and a distribution of pore diameters. An even simpler approach, that will be used here, is to adopt a pseudo-continuum pore model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: In the pseudo-continuum pore model, the reagents are assumed to diffuse in the radial direction as indicated by the arrows.\n\n\n\nThe pseudo-continuum pore model completely ignores the pore structure of the solid. Instead, it treats the catalyst particle as if it is a single homogeneous phase. It further assumes that the reactants diffuse in a straight line in the radial direction, as shown in Figure 13.7. Here, the diffusion process is assumed to obey Fick’s law, but an effective diffusivity is used in place of the true diffusion coefficient. With that, a steady state mole balance on reactant A within a spherical catalyst particle takes the form given in Equation 13.23. It should be noted, in particular, that the appropriate diffusion coefficient to use when modeling a porous solid depends upon the chemical species present, the nominal diameter of the catalyst pores and the mode of diffusion. Possible modes of diffusion include ordinary molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion, configurational diffusion and surface diffusion.\n\\[\n-D_{eff,A}\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 C_A}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{2}{r} \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial r}\\right) = r_A\n\\tag{13.23}\\]\nIn reality, of course, if you looked at any spherical shell within the catalyst particle, only a fraction of the surface of that shell would be available for diffusion because the reactant could not really diffuse through the solid, only the pores. It is commonly assumed that the fraction of the surface of any spherical shell that is available for diffusion is equal to the void fraction, \\(\\varepsilon\\), of the catalyst particle (not the void fraction of the packed bed of particles, \\(\\epsilon\\)). Similarly, the actual path followed by a diffusing reactant in reality will twist and turn so that the distance the reactant travels to reach the center of the particle is greater than the radius of the particle. A quantity known as the tortuosity, \\(\\tau\\), is used to account for the difference between the straight line distance to the center and the actual path length. With these two correction factors, the effective diffusivity can be related to the appropriate true diffusion coefficient for species A according to Equation 13.24.\n\\[\nD_{eff,A} = \\frac{\\varepsilon D_A}{\\tau}\n\\tag{13.24}\\]\nAssuming the total number of moles is not changed by reaction, a mole balance can be written for reactant A on a differentially thin spherical shell within the spherical catalyst particle. Assuming that the rate is again first order, but it is normalized per unit mass of catalyst, and letting \\(\\rho_{part}\\) represent the apparent density of a catalyst particle, Equation 13.25 results by taking the limit as the shell thickness goes to zero. Equation 13.25 is equivalent to Equation 13.23; it is a second order differential equation that can be integrated analytically to obtain an expression for the concentration of A as a function of radial position within the catalyst particle. Doing so leads to two constants of integration. The values of these constants of integration are found by applying the boundary conditions specified in Equations 13.26 and 13.27. The first boundary condition simply requires that the concentration of A at the entrance to the porous solid is equal to the external surface concentration of A. The second boundary condition is a symmetry condition that requires that the concentration gradient go to zero at the center of the particle.\n\\[\nD_{eff,A} \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left( r^2 \\frac{dC_A}{dr} \\right) = \\rho_{part}k C_A\n\\tag{13.25}\\]\n\\[\nC_A \\big\\vert_{r=R_{part}} = C_{A,surf}\n\\tag{13.26}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dC_A}{dr} \\Big \\vert_{r=0} = 0\n\\tag{13.27}\\]\nIntegrating Equation 13.25, finding the constants of integration and substituting them back into the result leads to Equation 13.28 for the concentration of A as a function of radial position within the catalyst particle. Equation 13.28 only applies for a spherical catalyst particle with a first order reaction taking place. E. W. Thiele was among the first to derive models of this kind, and consequently the name Thiele modulus is given to the dimensionless quantity \\(\\phi\\), Equation 13.29, which represents the ratio of reaction rate to diffusion rate. It should be noted that in general, the definition of the Thiele modulus depends upon the geometry of the catalyst particle and the form of the rate expression.\n\\[\nC_A\\left(r\\right) = C_{A,surf} \\frac{\\sinh{\\left(\\phi \\frac{r}{R_{part}}\\right)}}{\\frac{r}{R_{part}}\\sinh{\\phi}}\n\\tag{13.28}\\]\n\\[\n\\phi = R_{part}\\sqrt{\\frac{k\\rho_{part}}{D_{eff,A}}}\n\\tag{13.29}\\]\nThe flux of reactant A into the catalyst through its surface (i. e. in the negative \\(r\\) direction) is related to the gradient in the concentration of A at the surface according to Equation 13.30. Substitution of the derivative of Equation 13.28 into equation Equation 13.30 gives an expression for the flux of A into the catalyst particle, Equation 13.31. Multiplication of this flux by the external surface area of the catalyst particle gives the rate at which reactant A enters the particle.\n\\[\n-N_A = D_{eff,A} \\left( \\frac{dC_A}{dr}\\Big\\vert_{r = R_{part}} \\right)\n\\tag{13.30}\\]\n\\[\n-N_A = \\frac{\\phi D_{eff,A} C_{A,surf}}{R_{part}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tanh{\\phi}} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\right)\n\\tag{13.31}\\]\nAs before, at steady state, the rate at which A enters the catalyst particle must just equal the rate of reaction of A within the particle, because otherwise A would accumulate within the particle. It is interesting to compare the rate of reaction given above to the what the rate would equal if there were no concentration gradients. Letting \\(\\eta\\) represent the ratio of the actual rate of reaction (where concentration gradients exist) to the rate that would be observed if there were no concentration gradients (and \\(C_A = C_{A,surf}\\) everywhere within the catalyst particle) leads to Equation 13.32. This quantity is known as the effectiveness factor; its value is given by Equation 13.32 only when the reaction is first order and the catalyst particles are spherical.\n\\[\n\\eta = \\frac{3}{\\phi} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tanh{\\phi}} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\right)\n\\tag{13.32}\\]\nThe utility of the effectiveness factor can be understood by first considering a situation where the external concentration gradients are negligible, such as that depicted in panel b of Figure 13.6. That is, consider the case where the concentration gradient across the boundary layer is negligible. In this case, \\(C_{A,surf} = C_{A,bulk}\\) and the actual rate of reaction, including the effect of the concentration gradients within the pores, is simply equal to the rate of reaction given by the rate expression for the bulk fluid concentration multiplied by the effectiveness factor. Put differently, in the absence of concentration gradients in the boundary layer, all that is needed in order to correct one of the ideal reactor models so that it accounts for the concentration gradients within the spherical catalyst particles is to multiply the rate expression by the effectiveness factor, as in Equation 13.33, where the rate would be normalized per unit catalyst volume.\n\\[\n-r_A = \\eta \\rho_{part}kC_{A,bulk}\n\\tag{13.33}\\]\nFigure 13.8 plots the effectiveness factor for a first order reaction taking place in a spherical catalyst particle as a function of the Thiele modulus. The figure shows that as the Thiele modulus goes to zero, the effectiveness factor approaches one. The effectiveness factor remains close to one for values of the Thiele modulus up to ca. 1, so generally one would prefer to operate a reactor at a Thiele modulus around 1 or less. At values of the Thiele modulus greater than 1, the effectiveness factor decreases rapidly, eventually approaching an asymptotic slope equal to \\(\\frac{3}{\\phi}\\) (for a first-order reaction in a spherical particle).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Effectiveness factor for a first order reaction in a spherical catalyst particle.\n\n\n\nA word of caution is in order. When the reaction is first order, as in the analysis presented above, the Thiele modulus does not depend upon the concentration of A at the catalyst surface. This is rarely the case; for other reaction orders, the corresponding Thiele modulus, and consequently the effectiveness factor, depends upon the concentration of A at the catalyst surface. This means that as the reaction proceeds, the effectiveness factor will change. In addition, for a spherical catalyst particle and most reaction orders other than one, it has not proven possible to obtain an analytical expression for the effectiveness factor like Equation 13.32, which is for a first order reaction. Instead, the effectiveness factor must be calculated numerically. Thus, it is possible to construct a plot of the effectiveness factor as a function of the Thiele modulus, similar to Figure 38.3. The problem, however, is that when that effectiveness factor is substituted into the PFR design equation, as in Equation 13.33, it is no longer a constant. A rigorous solution of Equation 13.33 requires that the variation in the effectiveness factor be accounted for.\nAccounting for Simulaneuous External and Internal Gradients Returning to the first order case, if the concentration gradient across the boundary layer is significant, as in panel c of Figure 13.6, Equation 13.31 is still valid. The only problem is that \\(C_{A,surf}\\) is no longer equal to \\(C_{A,bulk}\\). However, for a steady state process, the flux into the catalyst must just equal the flux through the boundary layer. This is expressed in Equation 13.34 which can be solved for \\(C_{A,surf}\\) giving Equation 13.35, and the result can be substituted back into Equation 13.31 to get an expression for the flux of reactant A into the catalyst in terms of the bulk fluid concentration of A, Equation 13.36. From that, an expression for the global effectiveness factor, \\(\\eta_G\\), can be derived, Equation 13.37. The global effectiveness factor in Equation 13.37 is the actual rate of reaction (i. e. in the presence of concentration gradients in both the boundary layer and the pores) divided by the rate of reaction in the absence of concentration gradients (i. e. if \\(C_A = C_{A,bulk}\\) everywhere). Equation 13.37 only applies for a first order reaction taking place isothermally in a spherical catalyst particle.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\phi D_{eff,A} C_{A,surf}}{R_{part}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tanh{\\phi}} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\right) = k_c \\left( C_{A,bulk} - C_{A,surf} \\right)\n\\tag{13.34}\\]\n\\[\nC_{A,surf} = \\frac{\\gamma C_{A,bulk} \\tanh{\\phi}}{\\phi + \\left( \\gamma - 1 \\right)\\tanh{\\phi}}\\, \\qquad \\gamma = \\frac{k_c R_{part}}{D_{eff,A}}\n\\tag{13.35}\\]\n\\[\n-N_A = \\frac{\\gamma C_{A,bulk} D_{eff,A}}{R_{part}} \\frac{\\phi - \\tanh{\\phi}}{\\phi + \\left( \\gamma - 1 \\right) \\tanh{\\phi}}\n\\tag{13.36}\\]\n\\[\n\\eta_G = \\frac{3}{\\phi} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tanh{\\phi}} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\right) \\frac{\\gamma \\tanh{\\phi}}{\\phi + \\left( \\gamma - 1 \\right) \\tanh{\\phi}}\n\\tag{13.37}\\]\nOnce again, the approach presented in this unit is but one of many means of accounting for concentration gradients during heterogeneous catalysis. A similar approach can be applied to additionally account for temperature gradients. The approach used here uses the pseudo-continuum model for the porous solid; models can also be developed using other pore models. This approach can be adapted to catalyst geometries other than spherical and to situations where the total number of moles changes upon reaction. These topics are typically treated in much greater detail in advanced courses on kinetics and reaction engineering.",

    "text": "13.7 Examples\nThis chapter includes six examples of the analysis of an isolated PFR. The first three examples illustrate response tasks involving steady-state PFRs. A gas-phase reaction with negligible pressure drop is considered in Example 13.7.1, and a liquid-phase system in Example 13.7.2. In the former example, the reactor design equations are solved to find the PFR output, while in the latter they are solved to find the feed temperature in addition to the reactor output. Example 13.7.3 examines a gas-phase, packed-bed PFR where a momentum balance is used to account for pressure drop. Example 13.7.4 illustrates an optimization task for a gas-phase reaction with negligible pressure drop. Example 13.7.5 analyzes the start-up of the PFR from Example 13.7.2 where the transient takes the form of a front that propgates along the length of the reactor. Finally, a packed-bed PFR with concentration gradients within the catalyst pores is considered in Example 13.7.6.\n\n13.7.1 Steady-State Conversion in a Gas-Phase PFR\nThe heat of reaction (1) is 44.8 kJ mol-1, and the reaction is irreversible. The rate expression is equation (2) where the pre-exponential factor is 7.22 x 106 mol atm-2 cm-3 s-1 and the activation energy is 84.1 kJ mol-1. A 10 foot long tubular reactor with a diameter of 1 inch is heated by a vapor condensing at 200 °C on the outside of the tube wall. The overall heat transfer coefficient is 7.48 x 104 J h-1 ft-2 K-1. Pressure drop through the reactor is negligible. If a gas phase mixture of 60% A and 40% B enters the reactor at 282 L min-1, 2.5 atm and 175 °C and if the heat capacities of A, B and Z are equal to 18.0, 12.25 and 21.2 cal mol-1 K-1, what steady state outlet temperature and conversion of B will result?\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 P_A P_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment describes an isolated PFR and the manner in which it operates and asks questions about the reactor outputs. I will need to create a model for the reactor and use it to answer the questions. I’ll first summarize the assignment by assigning an appropriate variable symbol to each quantity provided in the narrative. I’ll use a subscripted “in” to denote values at the inlet to the reactor, a subscripted “out” to denote values at the reactor outlet, and I’ll add values for the ideal gas constant since I know I’ll need them. The assignment explicitly asks for the steady-state values of the quantities of interest, and from reading the assignment, I see that the PFR is neither isothermal nor adiabatic, but instead it is heated.\n\n\n\n\n13.7.1.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = 44.8 kJ mol-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 7.22 x 106 mol atm-2 cm-3 s-1, \\(E_1\\) = 84.1 kJ mol-1, \\(L\\) = 10 ft, \\(D\\) = 1 in, \\(T_{ex}\\) = 200 °C, \\(U\\) = 7.48 x 104 J h-1 ft-2 K-1, \\(y_{A,in}\\) = 0.60, \\(y_{B,in}\\) = 0.40, \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) = 282 L min-1, \\(P\\) = 2.5 atm, \\(T_{in}\\) = 175 °C, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\) = 18.0 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,B}\\) = 12.25 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Z}\\) = 21.2 cal mol-1 K-1, and \\(R\\) = 8.314 J mol-1 K-1 = 0.08206 L atm mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Heated, steady-state PFR with negligible pressure drop\nQuantities of Interest: \\(T_{out}\\) and \\(f_B\\)\n\n\n13.7.1.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to generate the reactor design equations for modeling this particular PFR as discussed in Chapter 6. The minimum number of mole balances is equal to the number of mathematically independent reactions plus one mole balance per inert species. Since I’m going to solve them numerically, it’s just as easy to write a mole balance on every reagent in the system (A, B, and Z in this assignment). The PFR operates at steady-state, so I’ll start with the general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance given in Equation 6.39. There is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\cancelto{\\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j}\n\\]\nThis reactor is not isothermal, so the mole balances cannot be solved separately from an energy balance on the reacting gas. To generate that equation, I’ll start from the general form of the steady-state PFR energy balance, Equation 6.40. There are three reagents present in the reactor, so the first summation expands to three terms. Again, there is only one reaction taking place, so the final summation reduces to a single term. Knowing that I will be solving the design equations numerically, and that I’ll have to evaluate each of the derivatives, I’ll rearrange the equation into the form of a derivative expression (Appendix J).\n\\[\n\\cancelto{\\left( \\dot{n}_A \\hat{C}_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_B \\hat{C}_{p,B} + \\dot{n}_Z \\hat{C}_{p,Z}  \\right)}{\\left(\\sum_i \\dot{n}_i \\hat{C}_{p,i} \\right)} \\frac{d T}{d z} = \\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right) - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\cancelto{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d T}{d z} = \\frac{\\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right) - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\dot{n}_A \\hat{C}_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_B \\hat{C}_{p,B} + \\dot{n}_Z \\hat{C}_{p,Z}}\n\\]\nThe PFR is being heated using the latent heat of a heat exchange fluid. Because only the latent heat is involved, the temperature of the exchange fluid is constant. That means that I can solve the combined mole and reacting fluid energy balances independently of an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid. (In this assignment I’m not provide with sufficient information to solve the exchange fluid energy balance, but neither does the assignment ask for anything that would need to be calculated using it.)\nFinally, for PFRs a momentum balance is needed to account for pressure drop along the length of the reactor. In this assignment, however, it is noted that pressure drop is negligible, so I won’t add a momentum balance to the reactor design equations.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, and Z are presented in equations (3) - (5).

The outlet temperature is 138 °C and the conversion of B is 81.6 %. Apparently the rate of heat transfer to the reactor from the vapor condensing on the outside of the reactor wall is less than the heat absorbed by the endothermic reaction. The feed enters at 175 °C, and despite the heat being supplied by the 200 °C heat exchange fluid, the reacting fluid temperature drops to 138 °C by the time it reaches the reactor outlet.\nAs the temperature drops, the reaction rate decreases. If heat was not being supplied, the temperature would have dropped even lower resulting in a lower conversion at the reactor outlet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.7.2 Required Steady-State PFR Feed Temperature\nA perfectly insulated tubular reactor with a diameter of 10 cm and a length of 5 m is fed an aqueous solution containing A and B at concentrations of 1.0 and 1.2 M, respectively. This feed stream flows at 75 L min-1. Reagents A and B react according to reaction (1) with a rate of reaction that is accurately described by equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor equal to 8.72 x 105 L mol-1 min-1 and an activation energy of 7200 cal mol-1. The heat of reaction (1) is –10,700 cal mol-1 and may be assumed to be constant. The heat capacity of the solution and the density of the solution may be taken to be constant and equal to those of water (1.0 cal g-1 K-1 and 1.0 g cm-3). The pressure drop in the reactor is negligible.

To begin, I’ll summarize the assignment by assigning appropriate variable symbols to all of the quantities it mentions. I’ll use a subscripted “in” to denote values that apply to the feed and a subscripted “out” to denote values that apply to the reactor outlet. I’ll add the ideal gas constant to the list since I know I’ll need it.\nThe assignment states that the reactor is perfectly insulated. That means that it does not exchange heat through its walls, i. e. it is adiabatic. The assignment does not explicitly state that it operates at steady-state, but there is no mention of a change in any of the reactor inputs anywhere in the narrative. If the reactor was operating in a transient mode, something would have had to change to initiate the transient. Since no such change is mentioned, I can safely assume steady-state operation.\n\n\n\n\n13.7.2.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(D\\) = 10 cm, \\(L\\) = 5 m, \\(C_{A,in}\\) = 1.0 M, \\(C_{B,in}\\) = 1.2 M, \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) = 75 L min-1, \\(k_{0.1}\\) = 8.72 x 105 L mol-1 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 7200 cal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = –10,700 cal mol-1, \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\) = 1.0 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\rho\\) = 1.0 g cm-3, \\(f_A\\) = 0.95, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Adiabatic, steady-state PFR with negligible pressure drop\nQuantities of Interest: \\(T_{in}\\) and \\(T_{out}\\)\n\n\n13.7.2.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to complete this assignment I will need to create a model of this PFR and use it to answer the questions posed. I need to generate the reactor design equations for this PFR in order to model it. The design equations always include mole balances. Knowing I’ll be solving the design equations numerically, I’ll just write a mole balance on every reagent present in the system. This reactor operates at steady-state, so the general form of the mole balance is given by Equation 6.39. There is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i,1}r_1\n\\]\nThe reactor is not isothermal, so I cannot solve the mole balances independently. I need to add an energy balance on the reacting fluid. The general form of the steady-state PFR reacting fluid energy balance is given by Equation 6.40. The narrative provides the gravimetric heat capacity and the density of the liquid phase reacting fluid, to the first term can be modified to use that information. This PFR is adiabatic, so the heat exchange term is equal to zero, and again, there is only one reaction taking place.\n\\[\n\\cancelto{\\rho \\dot{V} \\breve{C}_p}{\\left(\\sum_i \\dot{n}_i \\hat{C}_{p,i} \\right)} \\frac{d T}{d z} = \\cancelto{0}{\\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right)} - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\cancelto{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\]\nWhen I solve the design equations numerically, I’m going to need to evaluate the derivatives, so I will re-write the equation in the form of a derivative expression (see Appendix J).\n\\[\n\\frac{d T}{d z} = -\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\frac{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\rho \\dot{V} \\tilde{C}_p}\n\\]\nThe reactor is adiabatic, so there isn’t a heat exchange fluid to write an energy balance on. The pressure drop is negligible, so a momentum balance is not needed.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z are presented in equations (3) through (6), and an energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (7).\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_A}{dz} = - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_B}{dz} = - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_Y}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d T}{d z} = -\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\frac{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\rho \\dot{V} \\tilde{C}_p} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are five IVODE reactor design equations and they contain five dependent variables (\\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and %T%), so there isn’t a need to eliminae a dependent variable or add an IVODE.\nInitial values and a stopping criterion are needed when solving IVODEs numerically. I can define \\(z=0\\) to be the inlet to the reactor, in which case the other initial values are the molar flow rates and the temperture at the reactor inlet. The feed only contains A and B, so the inlet molar flow rates of Y and Z are zero. The length of the reactor is given, so that can serve as the stopping criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assignment also specifies the conversion of A. As such, I could have used the final value of A \\(\\left(\\dot{n}_{A,out} = \\dot{n}_{A,in}\\left( 1 - f_A \\right)\\right)\\) as the stopping criterion. In that case I’d calculate \\(T_{in}\\) below using an implicit equation that requires the reactor length to equal \\(L\\) \\(\\left(T_{in}: z_{out} = L\\right)\\).\nIn the solution presented here I am using \\(z=L\\) as the stopping criterion and calculating \\(T_{in}\\) below using an implicit equation requires the conversion to have the specified value \\(\\left(T_{in}: f_{A} \\big \\vert_{z=L} = f_A\\right)\\).\nBoth approaches are valid and will produce the same results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 13.2: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (numbers).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(L\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_B\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_{in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 13.2.

The rate can be calculated using the rate expression, equation (2). In order to do that, the rate coefficient and the concentrations of A and B must be calculated. The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8. The concentrations can be calculated using the defining equation for concentration in an open system, Equation 1.15. The reacting fluid is a liquid; assuming it to be an incompressible ideal mixture means that the volumetric flow rate will be constant and equal to the inlet volumetric flow rate.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\n\\[\nk_1 = k_{0,1} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{V}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_B = \\frac{\\dot{n}_B}{\\dot{V}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V} = \\dot{V}_{in} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to calculate the initial and final values in Table 13.2.

The reactor design equations will be some combination of mole balances, an energy balance on the reacting fluid, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid, and, since this is a PFR, a momentum balance. I prefer to write mole balances on every reagent (other than liquid solvents) in the system. The general steady-state form of the PFR mole balance is given in Equation 6.39. There is only one reaction, so the summation becomes one term.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\nu_{i,1}r_1\n\\]\nThe PFR is not isothermal, so I must add an energy balance on the reacting gas. Equation 6.40 presents the general, steady-state form of the energy balance. None of the terms in the equation can be eliminated, but the two summations can be expanded, and the equation can be rearranged into the form of a derivative expression (see Appendix J).\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i \\dot{n}_i \\hat{C}_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{d T}{d z} = \\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right) - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d T}{d z} =  \\frac{\\pi DU \\left(T_{ex} - T\\right)-{\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \\Delta H_1}}{\\dot{n}_A \\hat{C}_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_B \\hat{C}_{p,I} + \\dot{n}_Y \\hat{C}_{p,Y} + \\dot{n}_Z \\hat{C}_{p,Z}}\n\\]\nThere is a vapor that is exchanging its latent heat with the reacting gas. Because only latent heat is being exchanged, the temperature of the heat exchange fluid is constant. That temperature is known, so I can solve the mole and energy balances above independently of an energy balance on the exchange fluid. Furthermore, since the assignment does not ask anything about the exchange fluid, I won’t need to use an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid.\nThe assignment does not mention pressure drop, but it does provide all of the information needed for calculating it using the Ergun equation, Equation 6.42. More generally, in a real-world engineering assignment, I would not know wheter pressure drop will be significant or not, so I would want to calculate it.\n\\[\n\\frac{{dP}}{{dz}} =  - \\frac{{1 - \\varepsilon }}{{{\\varepsilon ^3}}}\\frac{{{G^2}}}{{\\rho {\\Phi _s}{D_p}}}\\left[ {\\frac{{150\\left( {1 - \\varepsilon } \\right)\\mu }}{{{\\Phi _s}{D_p}G}} + 1.75} \\right]\n\\]\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, Y, Z, and I are presented in equations (3) through (6).

Initial values and a stopping criterion are needed in order to solve the IVODEs numerically. I can define \\(z=0\\) as the inlet to the reactor in which case the other initial values are simply the values of the dependent variables at the reactor inlet. Inlet mole fractions of A and I are specified, and the sum to one, so there isn’t any Y or Z in the feed. The reactor length is specified, so that can be used as the stopping criterion.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 13.3: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (numbers).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(L\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_I\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{I,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_{in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(P\\)\n\\(P_{in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 13.3.

The rate expression, equation (2), can be used to calculate \\(r_1\\), but before that can be done, the two rate coefficients and the partial pressures of the reactants and products must be calculated. The rate coefficients can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8. The partial pressure of reagent \\(i\\) is simply its mole fraction times the total pressure.\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\sum_i \\dot{n}_i}P = \\frac{\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_Y + \\dot{n}_Z + \\dot{n}_I}P\n\\]\n\\(G\\) can be calculated using its defining equation. The density could be calculated by multipying each molar flow rate times the corresponding molecular weight, to get mass flow rates of each reagent. These could then be totaled and divided by the volumetric flow rate to calculate the density.

The outlet temperature is 363 °C, the outlet pressure is 2.91 atm, and the conversion is 83.3%. This system is similar to that of Example 13.7.1 in that while the feed is at 400 °C and the heat exchange fluid is at 375 °C, the gas leaving the reactor is at 363 °C. Apparently the heat absorbed due to reaction greater than that provided by the heat exchange fluid.\nThe pressure drop here is only 0.09 atm. It is likely that in this case, ignoring the pressure drop would not have affected the calculated outlet temperature and conversion significantly. However, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of the pressure drop in a packed bed. Consequently, it is wise to account for it in case it proves to be more significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.7.4 Minimum Water-Gas Shift Reactor Volume\nThe water-gas shift, equation (1), is used to reduce the amount of CO in gas mixtures containing CO, CO2, H2, H2O, and other gases. It is exothermic, \\(\\Delta H\\) = –9120 cal mol-1, and reversible with the equilibrium constant given by equation (3) with \\(K_{0,1}\\) = 0.132. The heat capacities of CO, H2O, CO2, H2, and inert, I, can be take to be constant and equal to 29.3, 34.3, 41.3, 29.2, and 40.5 J mol-1 K-1, respectively. Two reactors are often used, one operating at higher temperatures and the other at lower temperatures. The steam to CO feed ratio is often in the range from 3 to 6.

The reactor is an adiabatic PFR with negligible pressure drop, so I won’t need an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid (because there isn’t one) or a momentum balance (because pressure drop is negligible). So for this assignment the reactor design equations will consist of mole balances and an energy balance on the reacting gas. I’ll write mole balances for each of the five reagents. The general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance is given in Equation 6.39. In this assignment, however, the reactor diameter and length are not mentioned, only the volume.

The assignment provides some guidance on selecting that range in the statement that the steam to carbon monoxide ratio is normally between 3 and 6.\nHaving chosen a range of values for the inlet molar flow rate of steam the reactor design equations can be solved numerically for each value in the range to get corresponding sets of values of \\(z\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{CO}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{H_2O}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{CO_2}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{H_2}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{I}\\), and \\(T\\) spanning the range from their initial (inlet) values to their final (outlet) values.

Figure 13.9 shows the reactor volume as a function of the steam feed rate, and Figure 13.10 shows the outlet temperature. The minimum reactor volume, 2.2 x 103 cm3, occurs at an H2O feed rate of 4.82 mol h-1. The corresponding outlet temperature is 380 °C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: Reactor volume as a function of H2O feed rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.10: Outlet Temperature as a function of H2O feed rate.\n\n\n\nThe results are reasonable, based upon a quantitative analysis. First, as the amount of steam in the feed increases, it is expected that the outlet temperature will decrease if the conversion is held constant. By holding the conversion constant, the heat given off by the reaction is also constant. As the amount of steam in the feed increases, the heat of reaction gets spread across a larger number of moles, and consequently the temperature rise of the gas is smaller. Since the inlet temperature is constant, this means that the average temperature in the reactor decreases as the amount of steam in the feed increases.\nWith respect to the rate of reaction, increasing the steam in the feed leads to a greater average partial pressure of steam and a lower average temperature in the reactor. Examining the rate expression, it can be seen that decreasing the average temperature will cause the rate coefficient to decrease, and taken alone, this will always cause the rate to decrease. If the rate is decreasing, then the volume should increase. While that eventually does occur, Figure 13.9 shows that at lower steam feed rates, the volume is decreasing, so there must be other factors that are important.\nThe temperature also affects the equilibrium constant. It will increase as the average temperature decreases (i. e. as the steam feed rate increases). This causes the second term in parentheses in equation (2) to increase. Since that term is being subtracted, increaseing it, taken alone, would also tend to decrease the rate and increase the volume. Thus, the decreasing temperature, taken alone, would lead to a steadily decreasing rate because the rate coefficient would decrease and the term containing the equilibrium constant, which is being subtracted, would increase.\nHowever, increasing the steam feed rate will also lead to a larger average partial pressure of steam in the reactor. The rate expression shows that, taken alone, this would tend to increase the reaction rate. So, the increasing partial pressure of steam tends to increase the rate while the decreasing temperature tends to decrease it. As such, the minimum in the volume seen is Figure 13.9 can be explained qualitatively. At lower steam feed rates, the increased steam partial pressure predominates over the decreased temperature leading to an increase in the rate and a corresponding decrease in the volume needed to reach the fixed conversion. Eventually, the effects of increasing steam partial pressure and decreasing temperature become equal and the volume reaches a minimum. Upon further increase in the steam feed rate, the effect of decreasing temperature predominates over the effect of increasing steam partial pressure, and the rate decreases, leading to an increased reactor volume.\nThe water-gas shift reaction offers an excellent example of a reversible, exothermic reaction. It was noted in the assignment narrative that two reactors are often used. The reactor considered in this assignment is representative of the first of the two reactors. While the system is far from thermodynamic equilibrium, this reactor can operate at higher temperatures where the rate is larger and the corresponding volume is smaller. However, the reaction approaches equilibrium at conversions that are much smaller than desired.\nTherefore in commercial practice, in order to reach higher conversions, the product stream from the first reactor is cooled and fed to a second reactor that operates at much lower temperature. The rate in the second reactor is not as large, due to the lower temperature, but the reaction can proceed to much higher conversion before it approaches equilibrium because the equilibrium constant is much smaller. This situation creates an interesting system design/oprimization situation where the total volume of the two reactors can be minimized with respect to the steam feed rate, the temperature of the feed entering the first reactor, the conversion in the first reactor, and the temperature of the feed entering the second reactor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.7.5 Start-up of the PFR from Example 13.7.2\nA perfectly insulated PFR with a diameter of 10 cm and a length of 5 m is going to be used for reaction (1). To start up the reactor, a steady, 75 L min-1 flow of pure water at 25 °C is established. A switching valve is then used to instantaneously change the feed to an aqueous solution containing A and B at concentrations of 1.0 and 1.2 M, respectively. This feed stream is at a constant inlet temperature of 30 °C and flows at the same rate as the water it replaces, 75 L min-1. Reagents A and B react according to reaction (1) with a rate of reaction that is accurately described by equation (2). The pre-exponential factor in equation (2) is 8.72 x 105 L mol-1 min-1 and the activation energy is 7200 cal mol-1. The heat of reaction (1) is -10,700 cal mol-1 and may be assumed to be constant. The heat capacity and density of the solution may be taken to be constant and equal to those of water (1.0 cal g-1 K-1 and 1.0 g cm-3). The pressure drop in the reactor is negligible. Plot the molar flow rate of A and the temperature as a function of axial position within the reactor 0.131 minutes after the feed was switched. Plot the same variables again 0.262 min, 0.393 min and 0.524 min after the feed was switched. (Note: the specified times correspond to one-fourth of the space time, one-half of the space time, three fourths of the space time and the space time.)\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_AC_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment describes the start-up of a PFR, so the reactor will be operating in a transient mode. However, the changes that are made to initiate the transient only affect the fluid at the reactor inlet. The flow rate of fluid within the reactor does not change, nor does the amount of heat being exchanged through the reactor wall (the reactor is adiabatic). Because there is no mixing in the axial direction, the sudden change in the reagent concentrations and temperature only affect the inlet. The changes will propagate through the reactor as a front, and, in this case, can be described using the steady-state axial profiles before and after the change. I’ll begin by assigning appropriate variable symbols to each quantity mentioned in the assignment. In addition to sub-scripted “in” and “out” to denote quantities at the reactor inlet and outlet, I will use “b” and “a” to indicate values before and after the step changes in concentrations and temperature are applied to the reactor inlet.\n\n\n\n\n13.7.5.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(D\\) = 10 cm, \\(L\\) = 5 m, \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\) = 75 L min-1, \\(T_{in,b}\\) = 25 °C, \\(C_{A,in,b}\\) = 0.0 M, \\(C_{B,in,b}\\) = 0.0 M, \\(C_{A,in,a}\\) = 1.0 M, \\(C_{B,in,a}\\) = 1.2 M, \\(T_{in,a}\\) = 30 °C, \\(k_{0.1}\\) = 8.72 x 105 L mol-1 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 7200 cal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = –10,700 cal mol-1, \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\) = 1.0 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\rho\\) = 1.0 g cm-3, \\(\\tau\\) = 0.131, 0.262, 0.393, and 0.524 min, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Adiabatic PFR with a transient front.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(\\dot{n}_A \\left(z\\right)\\) and \\(T\\left(z\\right)\\) as graphs at \\(\\tau\\) = 0.131, 0.262, 0.393, and 0.524 min\n\n\n13.7.5.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the change propagates as a front I can calculate the position of the front as a function of time. The concentration and temperature profiles ahead of the front are the steady-state profiles prior to the switch and those behind the front are the steady-state profiles after the switch. Therefore, I only need to calculate the steady-state profiels prior to the switch and after the switch.\nI really don’t need to calculate the front prior to the switch. Pure water at \\(T_{in,b}\\) is flowing steadily through the reactor.

I don’t need an energy balance on the exchange fluid because there isn’t one, and I don’t need a momentum balance because pressure drop is negligible.\nThe general form of the mole balance is given by Equation 6.39.

Profiles of the molar flow rate of A and the temperature within the reactor 0.131, 0.262, 0.393, and 0.524 min after the feed switch are shown in Figure 13.11. For an incompressible fluid flowing through a PFR at steady-state, the space time is equal to the amount of time the fluid spends within the reactor. Thus, as the figure shows, the front has just reached the outlet of the PFR at a time equal to the space time. For any times greater than this, the profile be invariant with the shape shown in the bottom panel of the figure because after one spece time, the reactor will have reached its new steady state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.11: Concentration (blue) and temperature (red) profiles 0.131, 0.262, 0.393, and 0,524 min after the feed flow started (top to bottom).\n\n\n\nThe profiles shown in Figure 13.11 seem a bit unrealistic. Consider what the transient PFR model would predict if only the temperature of the water flowing into this had been changed and without adding reactant to the feed. The model would predict that 0.262 minutes later the temperature of the first half of the reactor would be at 30 °C, and the temperature in the second half of the reactor would be 25 °C, with an abrupt change at the middle of the reactor. A very sharp transition like that is counter-intuitive. Instead, one might expect a smoother transition from hot to cold, not an instantaneous step change. The axial dispersion model presented in Chapter 22 pridicts a smoother, and intuitively more reasonable, temperature transition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe method of analysis used in this example only applies in the special case where the transient is initiated by step changes in reagent concentration and or temperature at the inlet to the PFR. If the volumetric flow rate had changed, this method of analysis would not be applicable because a change in inlet flow rate affects all of the fluid in the reactor, not just the fluid entering it. Similarly, if there had been heat exchange through the reactor wall and the temperature of the exchange fluid had changed, this method of analysis would not be applicable, again because all of the fluid in the reactor would be affected, not just that entering it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.7.6 Gas-Phase Reaction in a Packed-Bed PFR with Internal Concentration Gradients\nThe gas-phase conversion of A to Z, equation (1), takes place at steady-state in a packed bed PFR operating isothermally at 400 °C. The reaction rate per unit catalyst particle volume is first order in A, equation (2), and at the operating temperature, the rate coefficient is equal to 0.15 cm3fluid cm3particle s-1. The void fraction within the packed bed is equal to 0.4. Pure A, flowing at 1.0 cm3 s-1 (0.054 g s-1), 400 °C, and 30 atm is fed to the reactor. There are no temperature gradients anywhere in the reactor or in the catalyst particles, and there are no concentration gradients external to the spherical catalyst particles which have a diameter, \\(D_p\\) of 4 mm. The effective diffusion coefficient of A within the porous catalyst particles is equal to 0.0029 cm2 s-1 and the gas viscosity may be assumed to be constant and equal to 0.022 cP. If the reactor diameter is 1.5 cm and the conversion of A in the reactor is to equal 85%, what reactor length is required?\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 C_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis problem describes operation of an isothermal steady-state PFR.

The reactor design equations must always include mole balances. I will write mole balances for both A and Z. The general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance is shown in Equation 6.39.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nHowever, that form of the mole balance assumes that the rate is normalized per volume of reactor (or here per volume of packed bed), that there aren’t any composition or temperature gradients between the fluid and the catalyst particles, and that there aren’t any gradients within the particles. The rate expression provided in the assignment is normalized per catalyst particle volume. Noting that there is only one reaction taking place, the mole balance can be modified to account for the normalization of the rate.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i,1}\\frac{V_{part}}{V_{bed}}r_1\n\\]\nThe particle volume is the bed volume minus the void volume, and the void volume is equal to the bed volume times the void fraction.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z} &= \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i,1}\\frac{V_{part}}{V_{bed}}r_1 \\\\&= \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i,1}\\frac{V_{bed} - V_{void}}{V_{bed}}r_1 \\\\&= \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i,1}\\frac{V_{bed} -  \\epsilon V_{bed}}{V_{bed}}r_1 = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i,1}\\left( 1 -  \\epsilon \\right)r_1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThat accounts for the rate normalization. The assignment states that there aren’t any gradients external to the particles and that there aren’t any temperature gradients within the particles. However, there may be concentration gradients within the particles. One way to account for any internal concentration gradients is to multiply the rate by the effectiveness factor. Doing so yields a mole balance where the normalization of the rate has been accounted for as have any concentration gradients within the particles.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i,1}\\left( 1 -  \\epsilon \\right)\\eta r_1\n\\]\nThe assignment states that the reactor is isothermal and there aren’t any temperature gradients anywhere. In that case, I can solve the mole balance equations independently of the energy balance on the reacting fluid and the energy balance on the heat exchange fluid. Since the assignment does not ask any questions associated with either of those balances, I do not need to include them. The assignment does not mention whether or not there is a pressure drop in the reactor. As such, I’ll need to include a momentum balance in case pressure drop is significant. The steady-state momentum balance for a PFR is given in Equation 6.42.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A and Z are presented in equations (3) and (4), and a momentum balance is shown in equation (5).\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{dz} = - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\left(1-\\varepsilon \\right)\\eta r_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\left(1-\\varepsilon \\right)\\eta r_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{dP}}{{dz}} =  - \\frac{{1 - \\varepsilon }}{{{\\varepsilon ^3}}}\\frac{{{G^2}}}{{\\rho {\\Phi _s}{D_p}}}\\left[ {\\frac{{150\\left( {1 - \\varepsilon } \\right)\\mu }}{{{\\Phi _s}{D_p}G}} + 1.75} \\right] \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations consist of three IVODEs and they contain three dependent variables (\\(\\dot{n}_A\\),\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(P\\)) so there isn’t any need to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable.\nInitial values and a stopping criterion are needed when solving IVODEs numerically. I can define \\(z=0\\) as the reactor inlet, in which case the other initial values are simply the values of the dependent variables at the reactor inlet. Here the reactor is fed pure A, so the initial molar flow rate of Z is equal to zero. I know the conversion, so I can calculate the outlet molar flow rate of A and use it as the stopping criterion.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 13.6: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (numbers).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,out}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(P\\)\n\\(P_{in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 13.6.\nAt the start of each integration step \\(z\\), \\(\\dot{n}_A\\),\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(P\\) will be known along with the given and known constants listed in the assignment summary. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions. Examination of equations (3) - (5) shows that for this assigment I’ll need to calculate \\(\\eta\\), \\(r_1\\), \\(G\\), \\(\\rho\\), and \\(\\Phi_s\\).\nThe catalyst particles are spherical, so I can calculate the effectiveness factor using Equation 13.32. In order to do that, I will first need to calculate the Thiele modulus for a spherical particle using Equation 13.29 and noting that the particle radius is half of its diameter.\n\\[\n\\eta = \\frac{3}{\\phi}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\tanh{\\phi}} - \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\phi = R_{\\text{part}}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_{eA}}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{part}}}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_{eA}}}\n\\]\nThe rate can be calculated using the given rate expression, equation (2), but in order to do so the concentration must first be calculated. Than can be done using the defining equation for concentration in an open system and the ideal gas equation.\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{V}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_Z}\\frac{P}{RT}\n\\]\nThe mass flux, \\(G\\), can be calculated using its definition.

During the calculations it is found that the effectiveness factor is 0.885, resulting in a reactor length of 13.5 cm. If the effectiveness factor was not used to correct for the concentration gradients within the catalyst particles, a significantly shorter length of 11.9 cm would have been calculated corresponding to an error of almost 12%.\nThe calculations also show that the pressure drop is negligible; the calculated outlet pressure is 30 atm, which is equal to the inlet pressure. Nonetheless, this calculation was necessary because there was no way of knowing ahead of time whether the pressure drop would be significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example serves to show that when a reacting system consists of more than one phase, it is essential to check for gradients in the fluid phases close to interfaces and, if there are porous solids, within the pores. The equations developed and used in Reaction Engineering Basics assume that the reacting fluid is homogeneous, i. e. that no such gradients exist. Using those reactor design equations to model systems where gradients do exist can result is significant error.\nThere are much more rigorous ways to account for gradients in a reacting system. Doing so is often a substantial component of intermediate and advanced reaction engineering textbooks and courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.",

    "text": "14.1 The Choice Between Non-Continuous and Continuous Processes\nMost of the criteria used when choosing between a continuous process and a non-continuus process have already been mentioned in previous chapters. This section simply gathers them together in one place. The most important criterion, perhaps, is the anticipated amount of the product to be produced anually. If the product is a commodity that is going to be produced and sold in large volumes, a continuous process is most likely preferred. The profit margin on commodity chemicals is often small, and production costs need to be minimized because they cannot be passed on to the consumer easily. Generally the additional labor and logistics of a non-continuous process lead to a larger production cost per pound of product compared to a continuous process.\nIn contrast, when a small annual production is anticipated, but the profit margin is large, a non-continuous process may be preferred. A non-continuous process allows production of value-added products on demand. This can reduce the costs associated with storing the products during seasons of low demand while allowing for ramping up production when demand is greater.\nAnother important factor is the number of different reactor operating conditions required to produce the product. If the “recipe” for making the product involves multiple reactive steps at different temperatures and of different durations, a non-continuous process will likely be preferred. For example if the reactive processing requires holding at one temperature for some period of time, then adding a reagent and holding at a different temperature for a different amount of time, a non-continuous process would probably be preferred. It is simply easier to follow this kind of recipe using a non-continuous process.\nSimilarly, if the reaction must be run at conditions where the reaction rate is very low, a non-continuous process may be the better choice. For processes where the rate is much faster, where additional reagents do not need to be added part way through the reaction process, and where multiple reaction temperatures are not required, a continuous process can be advantageous.\nFlexibility is another consideration when deciding between a continuous and a non-continuous process. A non-continuous process may be more suitable if the same reactor will be used to produce different products at different times. That is, it may be more challenging to use the same feed and product piping to conduct one chemical processes part of the time and a different reaction at other times in a continuous reactor system. Generally continuous processes are best when they can be started up and allowed to operate at steady state for extended periods of time.\nIn the final analysis, though, none of these criteria are definitive. Ultimately the choice between using a non-continuous process or a continuous process comes down to economics.",

    "section": "14.2 The Choice Between CSTRs and PFRs in Continuous Processes",
    "text": "14.2 The Choice Between CSTRs and PFRs in Continuous Processes\nIn some instances the choice between a CSTR and a PFR is an easy one, but under other circumstances it is not clear at all. The most significant difference between the two reactor types is how the temperature and composition vary during the reaction time. In continuous reactors, the reaction time is the length of time that the reacting fluid spends in the reactor.\nThe choice between a CSTR and a PFR is easiest when only one reaction is taking place and the reactor is isothermal. For typical reaction kinetics a high rate is favored by large reactant concentrations and, if the reaction is reversible, by small product concentrations. In an isothermal CSTR the concentrations are the outlet values and they do not vary during the reaction time. The reactant concentrations are smaller than in the feed, the product concentrations are larger than in the feed, and the reaction rate does not change during the reaction time.\nIn an isothermal PFR the concentrations change monotonically during the reaction time. The reactant concentrations start at their feed values and decrease steadily to their outlet values during the reaction time. The product concentrations start at their feed values and increase steadily to their outlet values. Based on those variations the rate of a typical reaction decreases steadily during the reaction time in a PFR.\nComparing equal feeds at equal conversions, the rate will be constant during the reaction time in a CSTR. When comparing at equal conversions, the outlet composition from a PFR will equal the CSTR composition. Therefore rate in a PFR will become equal to the CSTR rate at the end of the reaction time. Except at the very end of the reaction time, the rate in the PFR will be greater than the rate in the CSTR, so a PFR volume smaller than the CSTR volume is needed to reach the same final conversion.\nComparing equal feeds at equal space times means the reaction times for the reactors are the same, but the conversions differ. Again, the CSTR rate will be constant during the reaction time. Because the initial rate in the PFR is higher, the PFR will reach the same conversion as the CSTR in less reaction time than the CSTR. the PFR fluid will continue to react for the remainder of the reaction time, so its final conversion will be greater than the CSTR conversion.\nThus the choice between a CSTR and a PFR for a slngle, isothermal reaction is quite straightforward, but few commercial reactors operate isothermally. When the reactors are adiabatic, the composition effects are the same as in isothermal reactors, but temperature effects must also be considered. In a CSTR, the temperature does not change during the reaction time. The temperature and composition in the CSTR are constant and equal to their outlet values.\nThe temperature will change during the reaction time in a PFR, and the effect of that change can either reinforce the effect of composition change or it can oppose it. If the reaction is endothermic the temperature decreases steadily during the reaction time. Taken alone, this change decreases the rate and so it reinforces the effect of decreasing reactant concentration. If the reaction is exothermic, the temperature increases during the reaction time. Taken alone, this increases the rate, so for an exothermic reaction the effect of changing temperature during the reaction time opposes the effect of composition. This results in three possible rate behaviors in an adiabatic PFR with an exothermic reaction.\n\nThe rate increases steadily during the reaction time as would happen if the temperature effect was stronger than the composition effect over the reactor’s entire conversion range.\nThe rate increases, passes through a maximum, and then decreases during the reaction time as would happen if the temperature effect predominated at early reaction times and the concentration effect predominated at later reaction times.\nThe rate decreases steadily during the reaction time as would happen if the concentration effect was stronger than the temperature effect over the reactor’s entire conversion range. (As noted above, this rate behavior also occurs when the reaction is endothermic.)\n\nComparing equal feeds at equil conversions as above, the rate will not change during the reaction time in a CSTR, and because the conversions are equal, the rate in a PFR will become equal to the CSTR rate at the end of the PFR reaction time. If the rate in the PFR increases steadily during the reaction time (first rate behavior above) the required PFR volume will be larger than the CSTR. This is because the rate only become equal to the CSTR rate at the very end of the reaction time; prior to that the PFR rate is lower than the CSTR rate so the required volume is larger. Conversely, if the rate in the PFR decreases steadily (third rate behavior above) the required PFR volume will be smaller than the CSTR. If the PFR rate increases, passes through a maximum, and then decreases during the reaction time, the required PFR volume could be smaller or larger than the CSTR volume.\nComparing equal feeds at equil space times for a single reaction in adiabatic reactors, the rate again will not change during the reaction time in the CSTR. The reaction time in the PFR will equal the reaction time in the CSTR. If the PFR rate increases steadily during the reaction time, the conversion will be smaller in the PFR than in the CSTR. If the PFR rate decreases steadily during the reaction time, the conversion will be larger in the PFR than in the CSTR. Not surprisingly, if the PFR rate increases, passes through a maximum, and then decreases during the reaction time, the conversion in the PFR could be either larger or smaller than that in the CSTR.\nSome reactors are neither isothermal nor adiabatic, and in these cases the variation of the rate during the reaction time will differ from the rate behaviors described above. When more than one reaction is taking place the selectivity may be just as important as the reaction rate. The effects of temperature and composition upon the selectivity may be different from their effects upon the rate. This can lead to trade-offs between conversion and selectivity.\nIn summary, for a single reaction in an isothermal reactor the choice between a CSTR and a PFR is straightforward. For single reactions in adiabatic reactors it is straighforward if the reaction is endothermic. When the reaction is exothermic it won’t be known which of the three rate behaviors applies without performing at least a few preliminary calculations.\nFurthermore, all of the preceding qualitative analysis assumed typical kinetics. For atypical kinetics (autocatalytic reactions, reactant-inhibitie reactions, etc.) a similar analysis can be used. As was found for typical kinetics, in some cases the choice between a CSTR and a PFR will be straightforward while in others it won’t.\nIn the simplest of situations it may be possible to make a choice between a CSTR and a PFR on the basis of a qualitative analysis. In many other situations preliminary modeling of both reactor types may be needed to inform the choice of which reactor type to use. Finally, CSTRs are not well-suited to reactions that require a solid catalyst, in which case the use of a PFR is obvious.",

    "section": "14.3 Examples",
    "text": "14.3 Examples\nThe example presented in Chapter 11 describes possible design strategies an engineer might use when tasked with designing a non-continuous reactor for an auto-catalytic reaction. It focuses more upon selecting a key metric (the reactor volume) and identifying the operating parameters that can be varied to minimize that metric than on choosing the type of reactor to use.\nThe examples presented here focus upon initially choosing to use a CSTR, to use a PFR, or to analyze both reactor types before choosing one of them. Once that choice is made, design strategies analogous to the one presented in Example 11.3 can be developed for the chosen reactor type(s). As was the case in Chapter 11, these examples describe one possible design strategy, but they do not include any analysis. The reader should have learned how to model and analyze CSTRs and PFRs in Chapter 12 and Chapter 13.\nAs was true in Chapter 11, the engineer’s thinking is the essence of these examples, the usual “Click Here TSee What an Expert Might be Thinking” callouts are not used.\n\n14.3.1 Preliminary Design of a Continuous Reactor for an Exothermic Autocatalytic Reaction\nBackground: A chemical company is considering construction of a new plant to produce 15 million pounds of reagent Z per year. This will be the first time the company will produce Z. It is produced from reagent A in an irreversible, autocatalytic, exothermic reaction, equation (1). The rate expression is shown in equation (2) where the rate coefficient \\(k_2\\) is much, much smaller than \\(k_1\\). Kinetics and thermodynamic data are available for the system. The product, Z, must be at least 95% pure, and the reacting fluid temperature cannot exceed 115 °C. A small steam generator and a chilled water plant will be built to support the process.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_AC_Z + k_2C_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nAssignment: Perform a preliminary design for the reactor to be used in the new plant.\n\n14.3.1.1 Design Strategy\nThe annual production is large, so the process will be continuous. There isn’t an existing plant that I can use for reference, so I’ll need to decide whether to use a CSTR or a PFR. Some qualitative reasoning may help me make that choice. If I use a CSTR, it will operate at the final conditions where the temperature will be as high as allowed and the composition will consist of 95% Z and 5% A. Both of these factors favor a high rate, and consequently a small volume. (The reaction is auto-catalytic, so the rate remians high despite a lower reactant concentration and higher product concentration.) If I use a PFR, near the inlet the composition will be almost all A and the temperature will be low. This will lead to a very low rate near the inlet, a lower average rate, and consequently a large reactor. Based on this reasoning, it seems clear that a CSTR should be used.\nI’d like the reactor to be as small as possible which means I’d like the rate to be as large as possible. I can’t exceed 115 °C, so to provide a margin of safety, I’ll set the outlet temperature to be 100 °C. For the rate to be as large as possible, and knowing the conversion must equal 95%, that fixes the outlet composition and temperature.\nI’ll assume two weeks of down time per year, which fixes the outlet flow rate of Z at 1.5 x 106 lb per 50 weeks. I can convert that to a molar outlet flow rate, then, knowing the conversion, I can calculate the inlet molar flow rate of A. Then, knowing the rate and the inlet flow rates, I can calculate the reactor volume.\nI’m not sure whether the heat of reaction is sufficiently high to operate adiabatically. I might need to add heat or I might need to remove it so that the outlet temperature is 100 °C. I’ll need to calculate the necessary heat transfer area and exchange fluid temperature. I’ll assume that steam and cooling water will be available at the same temperatures as in other plants the company operations for the purposes of this preliminary design. If the design proceeds to a larger scale, the design of the steam and chilled water plants will need to be integrated into the reactor design.\nSince the reactor volume is essentially fixed by the specified production rate, the costs that scale with the reactor volume are also fixed. I expect that the steam and/or chilled water will be the next most significant contributors to the operating costs. If I need cooling, I can minimize the amount of coolant used by adjusting the heat transfer area.\nEven if I don’t need steam for steady-state operation, I will likely want to supply heat during process start-up. I’ll need to devise a start-up procedure and calculate its heat exchange requirements. If the steady-state process also requires steam, I’ll need to design the reactor for the more demanding of the two operating modes. I’ll assume that any steam used will be saturated, and adjust the heat transfer area to minimize the steam flow rate. I’ll assume that only 85% of the steam condenses to provide a margin of error.\n\n\n14.3.1.2 Discussion\nIn this assignment, the choice between a CSTR and a PFR was quite easy. The kinetics were such that high product concentration favors a high rate, and the reaction was exothermic, so adiabatic operation would give a high temperature, which also favors a high rate. The choice of a CSTR could be made on the basis of a qualitative analysis without requiring any computational analysis of a PFR.\nIn Example 11.3, the reactor volume was used as the key metric affecting the operating costs for the process. Here the reactor volume was effectively established by the specified production rate, product purity, and maximum temperature. Thus, the coolant and steam flow rates could be used as the key metrics affecting operating costs. Further, if both cooling (during steady-state operation) and heating (during start-up) were required, they could both be minimized because they would not be used simultaneously. The cooling could be minimized for steady-state operation and the heating for start-up.\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Preliminary Design of a Continuous Reactor for an Endothermic Reaction\nBackground: Z is the monomer used to produce a commodity polymer. Typically Z is produced from A via the endothermic, irreversible dehydrogenation reaction (1). The gas-phase dehydrogenation reaction is second order in A. A company wants to build a process to produce 10,000 tons of Z per year. The feed A will be avialable at 200 °C and 10 atm. The reactor must operate at 98% conversion, and its temperature must be kept below 800 °C.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z + H_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\nAssignment: Perform a preliminary design of a reactor for use in this process.\n\n14.3.2.1 Design Strategy\nThe amount of Z to be produced per year is very large, so I’ll design a continuous reactor. It is likely that I’ll need to heat the reactor whichever type I choose. If I choose a CSTR, it will operate at the outlet composition where the concentration of A will be very small, leading to a low rate of reaction, and therefore requiring a large reactor. Additionally, because the reacting fluid is a gas, it might be challenging to design the agitation so that mixing is perfect. So, it seems clear that I need to use a PFR.\nHaving chosen the reactor, most of the operational details are fixed. The conversion and outlet flow rates are set by the given process specifications, and knowing the conversion, I can calculate the feed flow rate. I want the reactor to be as small as possible because I expect operating costs to scale with the reactor volume. I could simply design the reactor to operate close to the maximum allowed temperature, leaving an appropriate margin of error.\nHowever, I don’t really know whether it is necessary to operate right at the limit. The rate may be sufficiently large at lower temperatures. Clearly there will be a trade-off between reactor volume and heating demand where using less heat will result in a larger volume. I also don’t know what the heat exchange fluid is going to be. It might be saturated steam, but depending upon the temperature, a molten salt might be preferred.\nFor the purposes of this preliminary design, I’ll assume that the temperature of the heat exchange fluid will be constant, and I’ll create a graph showing the reactor volume as a function of the heat exchange fluid temperature. That may prove helpful for choosing what to use as a heat exchange fluid as the design moves forward. That is, for a given volume it will show the necessary exchange fluid temperature, and that can be used to estimate the associated costs for various heat exchange fluids.\n\n\n14.3.2.2 Discussion\nIn this example, the choice of the type of reactor to use was unequivocal. The remaining available specifications were insufficient to go too far with the preliminary design. In situations like this it can be useful to explore the trade-offs between different operating parameters instead of choosing a key metric and minimizing it. In this way, preliminary choices can be made to more fully specify the nature of the system, after which a preliminary optimization can be performed.\nFor this system, the engineer would really need more details about the metals to be used for the reactor (what temperatures can it withstand, at what temperature might hydrogen embrittlement become an issue) and its compatibility with different heat exchange fluids. A very preliminary calculation of reactor volume versus heat exchange temperature like the one described above can inform decisions about the metallurgy, heat transfer medium, etc. Then a slightly improved preliminary design can be undertaken.\n\n\n\n14.3.3 Preliminary Design of a Continuous Reactor for an Exothermic Reaction\nBackground: The liquid-phase, exothermic reactions of A and B, equations (1) and (2), are exothermic, irreversible, first order in A and first order in B. D is the desired product because its value is significantly greater than U. The activation energy for reaction (1) is smaller than the activation energy for reaction (2) while their pre-exponential factors are comparable. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the reactions are well-documented.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow D + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow U + Z \\tag{2}\n\\]\nAssignment: For a proposed process to manufacture D, separate streams of A and B will br available at 30 °C where they will react at a modest rate when combined. The adiabatic temperature rise for the reactions at these feed conditions is approximately 60 °C. Chilled water will also be available at 25 °C. Perform a preliminary design of a continuous reactor for the conversion of A and B.\n\n14.3.3.1 Design Strategy\nThe assignment doesn’t specify a production rate, so I’ll choose a feed rate as a basis in my analysis. There are two important performance metrics in this system, the reactor volume and the yield of D. Based upon the information given in the assignment, the reactor could operate adiabatically, but it might be preferrable to cool it because lower temperature will favor the production of D (because the activation energy is smaller).\nThe choice of reactor is not clear-cut. If a CSTR is used, it will operate at higher temperature and lower reactant concentrations. Those factors have opposing effects upon the reaction rates, and by extension the reactor volume. If a PFR is used, the temperature at the inlet will be smaller, and the concentrations of the reactants will be larger. As the fluid progresses through the reactor, the temperature will rise, tending to increase the rate, while the reactant concentrations will decrease, tending to decrease the rate. Depending upon the conversion, it is possible that the average rate in the PFR will be close to the rate in the CSTR, and consequently, their volumes will be comparable. Because the temperature will vary in the PFR, it also isn’t clear which reactor will offer the better selectivity.\nGiven those uncertainties, it would not be prudent to choose the reactor type without performing any analysis. Instead, I will evaluate both reactor types and, if possible, choose the preferred reactor based upon a comparison of their performance. For either reactor type, I’m also not sure which of the performance metrics is most important, the reactor volume or the yield of D. That is, it might result that when the reactor volume is minimized, the yield of D is very small, or vice versa.\nIn light of the uncertainties described above, my design strategy for each of the two reactors will be as follows:\n\nChoose a range of reactor volumes.\n\nfor each volume, maximize the yield of D with respect to the coolant flow rate and heat transfer area.\nplot the maximum yield of D as a function of the reactor volume.\n\nChoose a range of values of the yield of D.\n\nfor each yield of D, minimize the reactor volume with respect to the coolant flow rate and heat transfer area.\nplot the minimum reactor volume as a function of the yield of D.\n\n\nThis will generate four graphs, two for the CSTR and two for the PFR. These graphs should make any trade-offs between reactor volume and yield apparent, and they may also show that one of the two reactor types is clearly superior. In any case, these graphs should be useful for refining the the design specifications.\n\n\n14.3.3.2 Discussion\nIn this assignment it wasn’t possible to select the reactor type on the basis of a qualitative analysis. This is often the case, especially if the reactor is being heated or cooled. It is better to do at least an initial computational analysis of both reactors and use the results to inform future design decisions.",

    "text": "15.1 Reactor Networks\nIn the preceding chapters, isolated reactors were considered. A chemical process can use more than one reactor to process a feed stream. The most common configurations of multiple reactors are series networks of reactors and parallel networks of reactors, as illustrated in Figure 15.1. Panel (a) of that figure shows two CSTRs in series where the reactors are labeled R1 and R2. Series networks are not limited to two reactors; there can be any number of reactors as long as the outlet from each one becomes the feed to the next. Series networks of PFRs are equally possible.\nThe (b) panel of Figure 15.1 shows two PFRs, labeled R1 and R2, that are connected to form a parallel network. Again, there can be any number of reactors in a parallel network, as long as a single stream is split, and distributed among the reactors, and as long as the outlet streams from all of the reactors are mixed into a single product stream. In the figure, S is used to denote a stream splitter and M is used to denote a stream mixer. Parallel networks can also be created using CSTRs.\nAnother possibility with series or parallel reactor networks is that the reactors might not be of the same type. For example an engineer could design a CSTR in series with a PFR with either of the two reactors first in the series network. Similarly, a CSTR in parallel with a PFR is also possible.\nReactor networks that are neither series nor parallel are also possible. Such networks are not common in commercial processing. However, Chapter 24 shows how reactor networks can be used to model a single, non-ideal reactor. In that situation, the reactor network need not be a series or parallel network.",

    "text": "15.2 Analysis of Reactor Networks\n\n15.2.1 Qualitative Behavior of Reactor Networks\nA series network of adiabatic PFRs is equivalent to a single adiabatic PFR with a volume equal to the total volume of the series PFRs. If the individual PFRs are heated or cooled, or if there is heating or cooling between one PFR outlet and the next PFR inlet, the performance of the network will be different from a single PFR with the same total volume.\nIn a parallel network of equally-sized PFRs where the feed is evenly split among the reactors, the temperature and concentration profiles along the length of each reactor are the same as for the other reactors. This assumes that the PFRs are either adiabatic, or they all pass through a single shell within which a perfectly mixed exchange fluid flows. It won’t be true if the heat exchange is different in different reactors.\nA series network of isothermal or adiabatic CSTRs becomes equivalent to a single PFR with the same total volume as the number of CSTRs approaches infinity. A series network of CSTRs is sometimes referred to as a CSTR cascade. Figure 13.2 showed that because there is no mixing in the axial direction in a PFR, the fluid can be envisioned as small batch reactors that enter the reactor one after the other, with each batch reactor moving from the inlet to the outlet at a velocity equal to the velocity of the fluid flowing in the PFR. Another way to think of this is that the little BSTRs are stationary CSTRs, and the fluid moves from one to the next. Since each CSTR is differentially small, it is easy to understand why an infinite series of CSTRs is equivalent to a PFR.\nIf each of the CSTRs in a series network are heated or cooled by exchange of heat with a perfectly mixed exchange fluid, the series will not approach the bahavior of a PFR as the number of CSTRs approaches infinity.\nIn a parallel network of equally sized and equally cooled/heated CSTRs, if the feed is divided equally among the reactors, the contents of every reactor will be the same.\nFinally, if parallel reactors are used, the mixing streams of unequal conversion should be avoided. Doing so effectively undoes some of the reaction that has taken place because after mixing the effective conversion of the mixed stream will be lower than that in the stream with the higher conversion before mixing.\n\n\n15.2.2 Quantitative Analysis of Reactor Networks\nIt is good practice to label each flow stream in the process and each piece of equipment. Variables representing flow rates, temperatures, pressures, etc. can then be subscripted using the labels to denote the stream or equipment to which the variable applies. Here, only steady-state operation will be considered. The only equipment that may be present in the networks considered here are stream splitters, stream mixers, and heat exchangers. Quantitative analysis of a reactor network requires writing the reactor design equations for each reactor in the network and writing mole and energy balances for every splitter, mixer and heat eachanger in the network.\nThe analysis of any one of the reactors in a network is no different from the analysis of an isolated reactor. After all, it makes no difference in the analysis of a reactor whether the feed to that reactor is coming from a storage tank somewhere in the chemical plant or from the outlet of another reactor. Similarly, it makes no difference in the reactor analysis whether the product stream is sent to a distillation tower elsewhere in the chemical plant or to another reactor. Thus, the reactor design equations for each reactor are generated as described in Chapter 6 and illustrated in Chapters 12 and 13.\nA stream splitter will have one inlet stream and two or more outlet streams. A steady-state mole balance on reagent \\(i\\) takes the form shown in Equation 15.1 where \\(N_{out}\\) denotes the number of outlet streams and “out” indexes those streams. It is important to recognize that the temperatures of all entering and leaving streams are equal. As such, instead of writing energy balances, the temperatures of each of the streams leaving the splitter can simply be set equal to the temperature of the stream entering the splitter, Equation 15.2. Similarly, a splitter does not change concentration (or partial pressure); the concentration (or partial pressure) of reagent \\(i\\) in every outlet flow stream is equal to its concentration (or partial pressure) in the input stream.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\sum_{N_{out}} \\dot{n}_{i,out}\n\\tag{15.1}\\]\n\\[\nT_{out} = T_{in} \\text{ ; } \\quad out = 1...N_{out}\n\\tag{15.2}\\]\nA stream mixer will have two or more inlet streams and one outlet stream. A steady-state mole balance on reagent \\(i\\) takes the form shown in Equation 15.3 where \\(N_{in}\\) denotes the number of outlet streams and “in” indexes those streams. An energy balance takes the form shown in Equation 15.4. In both equations, \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{in}\\) denotes a summation of all of the inlet streams. For liquid flow streams, equivalent energy balances can be written in terms of the volumetric heat capacity or the gravimetric heat capacity, Equation 15.5 and Equation 15.6.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,out} - \\sum_{N_{in}} \\dot{n}_{i,in}\n\\tag{15.3}\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_i \\sum_{in} \\left(\\dot{n}_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^{T_{out}} \\hat{C}_{p,i} dT \\right)\n\\tag{15.4}\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{in} \\left(\\dot{V}_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^{T_{out}} \\breve{C}_p dT \\right)\n\\tag{15.5}\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{in} \\left(\\rho \\dot{V}_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^{T_{out}} \\tilde{C}_p dT \\right)\n\\tag{15.6}\\]\nA simple heat exchanger, will have two streams that do not mix while flowing through it. Letting “h1” and “h2” denote those two streams, mole balances take the form shown in Equations 15.7 and 15.8. The energy balance, Equation 15.9, simply requires that the rate at heat is added to stream “h1” must equal the rate at which heat is removed from stream “h2.” Those heats can be expressed in terms of molar heat capacities, volumetric heat capacities, or gravimetric heat capacities, Equations 15.10, 15.11, and 15.12. If the temperatures of three of the four streams (h1in, h1out, h2in, and h2out) are known, these are the only equations needed. If the temperatures of two of the four streams are known, an additional equation for the rate of heat transfer is needed, Equation 15.13, which assumes counter-current flow of the fluids and a heat transfer coefficient based on the log-mean temperature difference.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,h1,in} - \\dot{n}_{i,h1,out}\n\\tag{15.7}\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,h2,in} - \\dot{n}_{i,h2,out}\n\\tag{15.8}\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{Q}_{h1} - \\dot{Q}_{h2}\n\\tag{15.9}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{hx} = \\sum_i \\left( \\dot{n}_{i,hx,in} \\int_{T_{hx,in}}^{T_{hx,out}}\\hat{C}_{p,i} dT\\right)\n\\tag{15.10}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{hx} = \\dot{V}_{hx,in} \\int_{T_{hx,in}}^{T_{hx,out}} \\breve{C}_{p,hx} dT\n\\tag{15.11}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{hx} = \\rho_{hx} \\dot{V}_{hx,in} \\int_{T_{hx,in}}^{T_{hx,out}} \\tilde{C}_{p,hx} dT\n\\tag{15.12}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{hx} = UA\\left( \\frac{\\left(T_{h_1,in} - T_{h_2,out}\\right) - \\left( T_{h_1,out} - T_{h_2,in} \\right)}{\\ln{\\displaystyle\\frac{T_{h_1,in} - T_{h_2,out}}{T_{h_1,out} - T_{h_2,in} }}} \\right)\n\\tag{15.13}\\]\nOnce reactor design equations have been written for every reactor and mole and energy balances have been written for each heat exchanger, stream splitter and stream mixer, those equations need to be solved. The manner in which this is accomplished will depend upon the specific network being analyzed and the information that is known about that network. In some situations, it may be possible to solve the reactor design equations for the reactors and the mole and energy balances for the other equipment sequentially. In other situations the reactor design equations for one reactor may be coupled with the reactor design equations for another reactor or with the mole and energy balances for one or more of the other pieces of equipment. In thise cases, the coupled equations must be solved simultaneously.\nIn other words, there isn’t a single “recipe” for solving the model equations. Once all of the equations have been formulated, they can be inspected to determine whether any of them can be solved independently of the others. If so, that can be done, after which it will be necessary to devise a strategy for solving the remaining equations.",

    "section": "15.3 Reasons for Using a Reactor Network",
    "text": "15.3 Reasons for Using a Reactor Network\nThere are different reasons why a reactor network might be used instead of a single reactor. One possibility is expanding the capacity of an existing chemical plant. If a company decides to substantially increase the amount of material they are processing, the existing reactor may not be able to accommodate the increase. Increasing the flow rate to process more reactant will lower the residence time, and that generally will lower the conversion, offsetting the increased flow. It may make sense to continue using the existing reactor and add a second reactor to the process rather than eliminating the existing reactor and replacing it with a single, larger reactor.\nIn other cases, multiple reactors might be part of the original design. An example is the use of PFRs where it is necessary to heat or cool. It is quite common to use a large number of reactor tubes arranged in parallel, with a single shell surrounding all the tubes to provide heat transfer.\nAs described in Chapter 14, when a single CSTR is used, the reaction takes place at the final composition and temperature. When a single PFR is used, the composition and temperature vary continuously from their inlet values to their outlet values. Another reason for using multiple reactors is to change the temperature vs. reaction time or composition vs. reaction time. As an example, if two PFRs in series are used, each with cooling by heat exchange with a perfectly mixed heat exchange fluid, the temperature vs. reaction time will be different from that of a single PFR using the same exchange fluid. Sometimes it is possible to design a reactor network where the temperature vs. reaction time and/or composition vs. reaction time results in better performance than a single reactor. That is, a reactor network may require a smaller total reactor volume or it may offer better selectivity than a single reactor.\nConsider the difference between a single isothermal CSTR and two isothermal CSTRs in series. The single CSTR will operate at the final composition. For most reactions, this means that the rate will be small due to low concentration of reactant. When two CSTRs in series are used to convert an equal amount of reactant, the second CSTR will operate at the same final composition where the rate is low. However, the first CSTR will operate at a higher concentration of reactant and a correspondingly higher rate. Because part of the conversion is taking place at a higher rate, the total volume that is required will be smaller than a single CSTR where the rate is always low.\nIf the reaction is exothermic and the reactor operates adiabatically, then the increase in temperature (and its tendency to increase the rate) often will predominate over the decrease in reactant concentration (and its tendency to decrease the rate). A simple qualitative analysis will show that there will be a critical conversion, and a corresponding critical space time, where the rate reaches a maximum. If one were judicious in selecting the relative volumes of the two reactors in series, the first could be designed so that it operated at the critical space time where the reaction rate was at its maximum value. Then the second CSTR in series would be sized so that the desired overall conversion is achieved.\nThere are also situations where it might make sense to use two different kinds of reactor in a network. For example, consider an autocatalytic reaction such as cell growth. If one wanted to use a plug flow reactor for cell growth, the feed stream would always need to contain cells and substrate. However, if a small CSTR was installed in series ahead of the PFR, only substrate would need to be supplied in the feed. As long as cells are growing in the CSTR, the substrate would mix with those growing cells, and the feed to the PFR would contain both cells and substrate.",

    "text": "15.4 Examples\nThis chapter presents four examples of the analysis of simple reactor networks. The first three involve reactors in series while the last examines reactors in parallel. Example 15.4.1 compares series networks that include both a CSTR and a PFR, looking at the effect of which reactor is first. Example 15.4.2 illustrates a common situation where two packed bed reactors in series are used. Example 15.4.3 is an optimization problem where the feed and conversion are fixed for two CSTRs in series, and the assignment is to minimize the total volume. The last example tests the statement from this chapter that said mixing streams of unequal conversion should be avoided.\n\n15.4.1 Comparing a CSTR Followed by a PFR to a PFR Followed by a CSTR\nA 350 L adiabatic CSTR and a 350 L adiabatic PFR are going to be connected in series and used to convert reagent A according to irreversible reactions (1) and (2), where D is the desired product and U is an undesired, low-value byproduct. The feed consists of an aqueous stream containing 2.5 mol A L-1, flowing at a rate of 100 L min-1 at 38 °C. The liquid density may be assumed to be constant. The heat of reaction (1) is -21,500 cal mol-1 and that of reaction (2) is -24,000 cal mol-1. The heat capacity of the solution is constant and equal to 1.0 cal cm-3 K-1. The rate expressions for reactions (1) and (2) are given in equations (3), and (4), respectively. The pre-exponential factor for reaction (3) is 1.2 x 105 min-1, and the activation energy is 9100 cal mol-1. The Arrhenius parameters for reaction (4) are 2.17 x 107 L mol-1 min-1 and 13,400 cal mol-1.

Before summarizing the assignment, I will make a simple schematic where I label the reactors and the flow streams. I’ll use “R” with a number to denote the reactors and I’ll simply number the streams. Then I can use the labels as I summarize the assignment.\n\n\n\n\n15.4.1.1 Assignment Summary\nNetwork Schematic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: Schematic representation of the reactor network.\n\n\n\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(V_{CSTR}\\) = 350 L, \\(V_{PFR}\\) = 350 L, \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 2.5 mol L-1, \\(\\dot{V}_0\\) = 100 L min-1, \\(T_0\\) = 38 °C, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = –21,500 cal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_2\\) = –24,000 cal mol-1, \\(\\breve{C}_p\\) = 1.0 cal cm-3 K-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 1.2 x 105 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 9100 cal mol-1, \\(k_{0,2}\\) = 2.17 x 107 L mol-1 min-1, \\(E_2\\) = 13400 cal mol-1.\nReactor Systems: (a) adiabatic CSTR (R1) followed in series by an adiabatic PFR (R2), and (b) adiabatic PFR (R1) followed in series by an adiabatic CSTR (R2)\nQuantities of Interest: \\(f_A\\) and \\(S_{D/U}\\)\n\n\n15.4.1.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI know I need to generate the reactor design equations for each of the reactors. There isn’t any other equipment in this network, so no other mole and energy balances are needed.\nThe same reactor design equations will describe the CSTR irrespective of whether it is R1 or R2. However, the identy of the inlet and outlet streams will be different. To avoid writing two sets of CSTR design equations, I will use “in” to denote the stream flowing into the CSTR and “out” to denote the stream flowing out of the CSTR. Then, as I formulate the solution, I can set “in” equal to stream 0 for case (a), and I can set it equal to stream 1 for case (b).\nBoth reactors are adiabatic, so I need mole balances and an energy balance for each reactor. There is no mention of pressure drop in the PFR, and I don’t have sufficient information to calculate it, so I will assume negligible pressure drop in the PFR.\nThe general form of the steady-state CSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.31. Here there are two reactions, so the summation expands to two terms.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\Rightarrow \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_{i,out} + V \\left( \\nu_{i,1}r_1 + \\nu_{i,2}r_2\\right)\n\\]\nThe general form of the steady-state CSTR energy balance is given in equation Equation 6.32. In this system both the rate of heat transfer and the work are equal to zero, and the sensible heat term can be expressed in terms of the volumetric heat capacity given in the assignment narrative. At the same time, the constant heat capacity can be taken outside of the integral which can then be evaluated. As above, the summation over the reactions expands to two terms.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n0 &= \\cancelto{0}{\\dot{Q}} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot{W}} - \\cancelto{\\dot{V}_{in} \\breve{C}_p \\left( T_{out} - T_{in} \\right)}{\\sum_i\\dot{n}_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat{C}_{p,i}dT} \\\\&- \\cancelto{V \\left( r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2 \\right)}{V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance is given in Equation 6.39. Noting that \\(dV = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz\\), the equation can be rewritten using the volume as the independent variable. Again, there are two reactions, so the summation expands to two terms.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{dV} = \\nu_{i,1}r_1 + \\nu_{i,2}r_2\n\\]\nThe general form of the steady-state PFR energy balance is given in Equation 6.40. The energy balance can also be rewritten using the volume as the independent variable. The reactor is adiabatic so the heat transfer term goes to zero. The sensible heat can be written in terms of the volumetric heat capacity, and the summation over the two reactions can be expanded.\n\\[\n\\cancelto{\\dot{V} \\breve{C}_p}{\\left(\\sum_i \\dot{n}_i \\hat{C}_{p,i} \\right)} \\frac{d T}{d z} = \\cancelto{0}{\\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right)} - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d T}{dV} = -\\frac{r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2}{\\dot{V} \\breve{C}_p}\n\\]\nThis is a liquid-phase system, so the volumetric flow rates of the three streams are all equal to \\(\\dot{V}_0\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nSteady-state mole balance design equations for A, D, and U in the CSTR are presented in equations (5), (6), and (7). The steady-state CSTR energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (8). Steady-state mole and energy balances for the PFR are presented in equations (9) through (12).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_{A,out} + \\left( -r_1 - r_2 \\right)V_{CSTR} = \\epsilon_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{D,in} - \\dot{n}_{D,out} + r_1V_{CSTR} = \\epsilon_2 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{U,in} - \\dot{n}_{U,out} + r_2 V_{CSTR} = \\epsilon_3 \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot{V}_0 \\breve{C}_p \\left( T_{out} - T_{in} \\right) - V_{CSTR} \\left( r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2 \\right) = \\epsilon_4 \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_A}{dV} = -r_1 - r_2 \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_D}{dV} = r_1 \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_U}{dV} = r_2 \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d T}{dV} = -\\frac{r_1 \\Delta H_1 + r_2 \\Delta H_2}{\\dot{V}_0 \\breve{C}_p} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of dependent variables in the PFR design equations, four, is equal to the number of IVODEs, so it isn’t necessary to eliminate a dependent variable or add an IVODE. I do need initial values and a stopping criterion, however.\nI can define \\(V_{PFR} = 0\\) to be the PFR inlet. In that case, the initial values are simply the molar flow rates and the temperature at that point. For case (a) they are the values for stream 1 and for case (b) they are the values for stream 0. Stream 0 only contains A, so the flow rates of D and U are zero. In both cases, I know the total volume of the PFR and can use that as the stopping criterion.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 15.1: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations (9) through (12) for each of the two network configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value for Case (a)\nInitial Value for Case (b)\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(V\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(V_{PFR}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,1}\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_D\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{D,1}\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_U\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{U,1}\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_1\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with case (a) where the CSTR is first, I will need to set the variables in equations (5) through (8) that are labeled “in” equal to the values for stream 0. That will leave the variables labeled “out”, \\(r_1\\), and \\(r_2\\) as unknown. I can solve the four CSTR design equations for the four variables labeled “out.” In order to do so, I’ll need to provide an initial guess for the variables labeled “out,” and I’ll need to evaluate the residuals each time a new guess for the solution is generated. At that point, I will have values for every quantity in the residuals expressions, equations (5) through (8) except \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\).\nThe rates can be calculated using the rate expressions provided as equations (3) and (4). Before I can use them, I’ll need to calculate \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\). I can do that using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8. I’ll also need to calculate the concentration of A to substitute in the rate expression. I can use the defining equation for concentration in an open system, Equation 1.15 to do that, remembering that the rate is evaluated at the outlet composition and temperature.\nAfter I solve the CSTR design equations, I can solve the PFR design equations for case (a). The PFR design equations are IVODEs, so I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 15.1. Having solved the CSTR design equations and set stream 1 equal to the CSTR outlet stream, all of the initial and final values will be known.\nAt the start of each integration step, the independent variable (\\(V\\)) and the dependent variables (\\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_D\\), \\(\\dot{n}_U\\), and \\(T\\)) will be known, as will the given and known constants listed in the assignment summary. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the IVODE design equations. Here that means I’ll need to calculate the rates, and I can do so the same way as for the CSTR design equations.\nFor case (b), where the PFR is first, the initial and final values in Table 15.1 will again be known.

When the CSTR is the first reactor, the conversion is 75% and the selectivity is 2.63 mol D per mol U. If the PFR is first, the conversion is 65.7% and the selectivity is 2.76 mol D per mol U. This trade-off might have been expected on the basis of some qualitative reasoning.\nThe reactions are exothermic with typical kinetics, so a large rate, and correspondingly high conversion, is favored by high temperature and high reactant concentration. The reactions occur in parallel, and the instantaneous selectivity, \\(S_{D/U}\\), is the ratio of the desired to undesired reaction rates, as given in equation (33). Examination of that equation shows that high selectivity also is favored by high temperature (because \\(E_2 - E_1\\) is a positive number), but by low reactant concentration (due to the \\(\\frac{1}{C_A}\\) term).\n\\[\nS_{D/U} = \\frac{r_D}{r_U} = \\frac{k_{0,1} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT_1} \\right)}C_A}{k_{0,2} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_2}{RT_1} \\right)} C_A^2} = \\frac{k_{0,1}}{k_{0,2}} \\exp{ \\left( \\frac{E_2 - E_1}{RT} \\right)}\\frac{1}{C_A} \\tag{33}\n\\]\nThe temperature and the composition within the reactors are coupled through the reactor design equations. It isn’t possible to change one without affecting the other. When the type of the first reactor is changed, that affects the temperature and composition in both reactors. As such, it isn’t surprising that there is a trade-off between conversion and selectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.2 Water-Gas Shift in Series PFRs with Cooling Between the Reactors\nThe water-gas shift, equation (1), is exothermic, \\(\\Delta H\\) = –9120 cal mol-1, and reversible.

The reactors are both adiabatic PFRs, so I can use the same reactor design equations for both of them. There is neglibible pressure drop, so the mole balances and an energy balance on the reacting gas comprise the reactor design equations. The reactor diameters and lengths are not provided, but by noting that \\(dV = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz\\), I can write the design equations using the reaactor volume as the independent variable. The general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance is given in Equation 6.39.

The outlet temperature, in stream 3, is 246 °C, and the conversion is 99.4 %. A configuration like that shown in Figure 15.3 is used in commercial water-gas shift systems. There are several catalysts available for the reaction. Some are active and stable at higher temperatures (325 to 500 °C), some at lower temperatures (180 to 250 °C), and some at lower steam to CO ratios. However, none of the catalysts alone are capable of practically reaching high CO conversion in a single reactor.\nThe high temperature catalysts offer a greater reaction rate, which reduces the reactor volume. However, the equilibrium constant decreases with increasing temperature. As a consequence, equilibrium prevents the system from reaching high CO conversion in a single reactor. The low temperature catalysts operate at temperatures where equilibrium does not prevent high CO conversion. However, the adiabatic temperature rise that accompanies the reaction limits the conversion. At high conversion in a single reactor, the temperature increases to the maximum that the catalyst can withstand and prevents proceeding to high conversion. In addition, the rates at the lower temperatures are smaller resulting in larger reactor volumes. Catalysts that con operate a lower steam to CO ratios also become limited by the adiabatic temperature rise. Operating at lower steam to CO decreases the equilibrium conversion and it causes the reactor temperature to rise faster.\nA system like that depicted in Figure 15.3 circumvents the problems associated with a single reactor system. Reactor R1 uses a high-temperature catalyst and converts the majority of the CO. Because the temperature is high, the rate is large and that keeps the volume of reactor R1 smaller. The product from reactor R1 is cooled and fed to reactor R2 which uses a low-temperature catalyst. While the rate is smaller in reactor R2, equilibrium does not limit the conversion, and because much of the conversion is accomplished in reactor R1, the temperature rise in reactor R2 does not exceed the maximum temperature the catalyst can withstand.\nThe system examined in this assignment is not optimized. Typically dry feed composition and the final conversion of CO are fixed based upon the intended use of the hydrogen. A multi-dimensional optimization can be performed to find the process parameters that minimize the total volume of the reactors. The optimization variables include the steam to CO ratio in stream 0, the temperature of stream 0, the conversion in reactor R1, and the temperature of stream 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.3 Minimizing the Total Volume of Two CSTRs in Series\nAn aqueous solution at 30 °C containing A and B at concentrations of 1.0 and 1.2 M, respectively, is to be fed to two CSTRs in series at a flow rate of 75 L min-1. Reaction (1) will occur in the adiabatic reactors with a rate of reaction that is accurately described by equation (2). The rate coefficient exhibits Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 8.72 x 105 L mol-1 min-1 and an activation energy of 7200 cal mol-1. The heat of reaction (1) is -10,700 cal mol-1 and may be assumed to be constant. The heat capacity of the solution and the density of the solution may be taken to be constant and equal to those of water (1.0 cal g-1 K-1 and 1.0 g cm-3). If 90% of the A needs to be converted, what is the minimum total volume required, and how is it divided between the two reactors?\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves two CSTRs operating in series. To begin, I’ll sketch the system and label the reactors and flow streams. Then, as I summarize the assignment, I can use the stream number and reactor labels as subscripts on variables to indicate the stream or reactor to which they correspond.\n\n\n\n\n15.4.3.1 Assignment Summary\nNetwork Schematic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: Schematic representation of the two CSTR, R1 and R2, operating in series\n\n\n\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(T_0\\) = 30 °C, \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 1.0 mol l-1, \\(C_{B,0}\\) = 1.2 mol l-1, \\(\\dot{V}_0\\) = 75 L min-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 8.72 x 105 L mol-1 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 7200 cal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -10,700 cal mol-1, \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\) = 1.0 cal g-1 K-1, \\(\\rho\\) = 1.0 g cm-3, \\(f_A\\) = 0.9, \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1.\nReactor System: Two adiabatic, steady-state CSTRs in series\nQuantities of Interest: \\(V_{min}\\), \\(V_{R1,opt}\\), and \\(V_{R2,opt}\\).\n\n\n15.4.3.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only equipment in this system is the two reactors. I’ll need to generate the reactor design equations needed to model them. Since they are both steady-state adiabatic CSTRs and are processing the same set of reagents, the design equations needed to model them will be the same and will consist of mole balances on each of the reagents and an energy balance on the reacting fluid. Here I’ll use “in” and “out” to label the flow streams entering and leaving the reactor.\nThe general form of the steady-state CSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.31, and in this system there is only one reaction occurring. I’ll use \\(V_{Rx}\\) to represent the volume of the reactor where \\(x\\) can be either 1 or 2.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_{i,out} + V_{Rx} \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_{i,out} + V_{Rx} \\nu_{i,1}r_1\n\\]\nThe general form of the steady-state CSTR energy balance is given in Equation 6.32. The reactors in this system are adiabatic (\\(\\dot{Q} = 0\\)) and do no work (\\(\\dot{W} = 0\\)). The assignment provides the gravimetric heat capacity of the reacting fluid as a whole, so the term for the sensible heat can be written using that heat capacity. It is constant so it can be taken outside of the integral and the integral can be evaluated. As for the mole balances, there is only one reaction taking place. Both non-zero terms are preceded by minus signs, so I’ll multiply both sides of the equation by -1. Finally, the reacting fluid is a liquid and may be assumed to be incompressible, so I’ll use \\(\\dot{V}_0\\) as the volumetric flow rate since it is the same in all three streams.\n\\[\n0 = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot{Q}} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot{W}} - \\cancelto{\\rho \\dot{V}_0 \\tilde{C}_p \\left(T_{out} - T_{in} \\right)}{\\sum_i\\dot{n}_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat{C}_{p,i}dT} - V_{Rx} \\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\rho \\dot{V}_0 \\tilde{C}_p \\left(T_{out} - T_{in} \\right) + V_{Rx} r_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nAll of the reactor design equation above are written in the form of residual expressions in anticipation of solving them numerically. All together there are 10 reactor design equations (five for each reactor), so I can solve them to find the values of 10 unknown quantities. Very often the design equations are solved to find the outlet flow rates and temperature, but here the conversion of A, and hence \\(\\dot{n}_{A,2}\\) is known, so instead I’ll use the volume of reactor R1 as an unknown.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z in reactor R1 are presented in equations (3) through (6). The energy balance on the reacting fluid in reactor R1 is given in equation (7). The corresponding reactor design equations for reactor R2 are presented in equations (8) - (12). These ten equations can be solved to find the ten unknowns: \\(\\dot{n}_{A,1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,1}\\), \\(T_1\\) \\(V_{R1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,2}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,2}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,2}\\), \\(T_2\\)\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{A,0} - \\dot{n}_{A,1} - V_{R1} r_{1,R1} = \\epsilon_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{B,0} - \\dot{n}_{B,1} - V_{R1} r_{1,R1} = \\epsilon_2 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Y,0} - \\dot{n}_{Y,1} + V_{R1} r_{1,R1} = \\epsilon_3 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Z,0} - \\dot{n}_{Z,1} + V_{R1} r_{1,R1} = \\epsilon_4 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\rho \\dot{V}_0 \\tilde{C}_p \\left(T_1 - T_0 \\right) + V_{R1} r_{1,R1} \\Delta H_1 = \\epsilon_5 \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{A,1} - \\dot{n}_{A,2} - V_{R2} r_{1,R2} = \\epsilon_6 \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{B,1} - \\dot{n}_{B,2} - V_{R2} r_{1,R2} = \\epsilon_7 \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Y,1} - \\dot{n}_{Y,2} + V_{R2} r_{1,R2} = \\epsilon_8 \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Z,1} - \\dot{n}_{Z,2} + V_{R2} r_{1,R2} = \\epsilon_9 \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\rho \\dot{V}_0 \\tilde{C}_p \\left(T_2 - T_1 \\right) + V_{R2} r_{1,R2} \\Delta H_1 = \\epsilon_{10} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this assignment, the reactor design equations will be solved for \\(\\dot{n}_{A,1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,1}\\), \\(T_1\\) \\(V_{R1}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,2}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,2}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,2}\\), \\(T_2\\). In order to solve the ATEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: provide an initial guess for the solution and evaluate the residuals them each time an improved guess is generated.\nAt that point, guesses for each of the unknowns will be available along with the given and known constants listed in the assighment summary. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the residuals expressions. Examining equations (3) through (12) shows that I’ll need to calculate \\(\\dot{n}_{A,2}\\), the rate of reaction (1) in each of the two reactors (\\(r_{1,R1}\\) and \\(r_{1,R2}\\)) and the volume of reactor R2, \\(V_{R2}\\).\nI know the inlet molar flow rate of A and the conversion, so calculating \\(\\dot{n}_{A,2}\\) is trivial.\nThe rate in each reactor can be calculated using equation (2), noting that the rate coefficient and the concentrations are those of the outlet stream from that reactor. The rate coefficient can be calculated using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, and the concentrations using the defining equation for concentration in a flow system, Equation 1.15. When calculating the concentrations the volumetric flow rate can be set equal to \\(\\dot{V}_0\\) since it is the same in all three flow streams.\nI can’t write an explicit expression for the volume of reactor R2, but I do know that the total reactor volume must be minimized. So, I can choose a range of values for \\(V_{R2}\\), solve the reactor design equations for each value and choose the value that corresponds to the minimum total reactor volume.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Residuals\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,2} = \\dot{n}_{A,0} \\left( 1 - f_A \\right) \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{1,R1} = k_{0,1} \\exp{ \\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT_1} \\right) } \\left( \\frac{\\dot{n}_{A,1}}{\\dot{V}_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\dot{n}_{B,1}}{\\dot{V}_0} \\right) \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{1,R2} = k_{0,1} \\exp{ \\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT_2} \\right) } \\left( \\frac{\\dot{n}_{A,2}}{\\dot{V}_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\dot{n}_{B,2}}{\\dot{V}_0} \\right) \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\nV_{R2,opt} = \\underset{V_{R2}}{\\arg\\min}\\left( V_{R1} +V_{R2} \\right) \\tag{16}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the ATEs numerically, I’ll also need to provide an initial guess for the solution. To complete this assignment, I’m going to choose a range of values for \\(V_{R2}\\), solve the reactor design equations for each value, and then find the value where the total volume is smallest. Since I’ll start with the smallest value of \\(V_{R2}\\) in the range, I expect that most of the conversion will take place in the first reactor. Since I know the overall conversion of A is 90%, I can make good guesses for the outlet molar flow rates from the second reactor. For the temperatures I’ll just guess there is a small increase, and for the volume, I’ll guess a volume for reactor R1 that’s in the middle of the range of values for \\(V_{R2}\\). If I have difficulty converging the calculations, I may need to alter these guesses. Once I solve the reactor design equations for the first value of \\(V_{R2}\\) in the range, I can use the result as the guess for the next value in the range.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest\nThe reactor design equations will be solved using a range of values of \\(V_{R2}\\). This will yield a corresponding value of \\(V_{R1}\\) for each value in the range. The optimum value of \\(V_{R2}\\) will be the one where the total volume is minimized, equation (16).

The optimum volumes of reactors R1 and R2 are 48 L and 60.3 L, respectively. The minimum total reactor volume then is 108 L. fig-example_15_4_3_volume_plot shows the variation in the total reactor volume as the volume of reactor R2 changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: Total reactor volume as a function of the volume of reactor R2.\n\n\n\nIt is easy to understand why there is a minimum total volume when two adiabatic CSTRs operate in series with a fixed overall conversion and a fixed feed rate. When an exothermic reaction takes place adiabatically, thermal effects and composition effects oppose each other as the reaction time, or equivalently, the conversion, increases. As a consequence, as the reaction time or the conversion increases, the reaction rate may increase, reach a maximum, and then decrease. (See Example 9.6.1.)\nAs long as the final conversion from the two steady-state, adiabatic CSTRs in series is greater than the conversion where the rate is at its maximum, the rate will decrease as the conversion increases. In the present assignment, that means that the rate at 90% overall conversion, \\(r_{90\\%}\\), is smaler than the rate at, say, 85% conversion, \\(r_{85\\%}\\).\n\\[\nr_{90\\%} &lt; r_{85\\%}\n\\]\nNow consider the two CSTRs in Figure 15.4, and suppose that reactor R1 is vanishingly small. When that is true, the reacting fluid will spend very, very little time in reactor R1. (The time spent in the reactor is the volume divided by the fixed volumetric flow rate, \\(\\dot{V}_0\\), and here the volume is nearly zero.) In this situation all of the A must be converted in reactor R2, and it operates at the lowest rate. The reaction time, \\(\\tau_{R2}\\) will equal the amount converted in reactor R2, \\(0.9 \\dot{n}_{A,0}\\) divided by the rate in reactor R2, and the volume of reactor R2 will equal the product of the reaction time and the fixed volumetric feed rate. Since the volume of reactor R1 is zero, the total volume in this first scenario, \\(V_{\\text{scenario }1}\\), is just the volume of reactor R2.\n\\[\n\\tau_{R2} = \\frac{0.9 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad V_{R2} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.9 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}}\n\\]\n\\[\nV_{\\text{scenario }1} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.9 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}}\n\\]\nNext reconsider the two CSTRs in Figure 15.4, but suppose that reactor R2 is vanishingly small. By the same reasoning, in this case all of the reaction must take place in reactor R1, and it will operate at the lowest rate. In other words, the reaction time and volume of reactor R1 in this scenario will equal those of reactor R2 in the preceeding scenario.\n\\[\n\\tau_{R1} = \\frac{0.9 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad V_{R1} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.9 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}}\n\\]\n\\[\nV_{\\text{scenario }2} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.9 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}}\n\\]\nThose two scenarios represent the extremes on the spectrum of reactor sizes. In the first scenario reactor R1 accounted for 0% of the total reactor volume, and in the second scenario reactor R1 accounted for 100% of the total reactor volume. Additionally, the total reactor volume is the same for both scenarios.\nFinally, consider the situation where reactor R1 operates at 85% overall conversion and reactor R2 operates at 90% overall conversion. Clearly, this scenario is intermediate between secenarions 1 and 2 because reactor R1 accounts for more than 0%, but less than 100%, of the total reactor volume. In this scenario the amount of A converted in reactor R1 is \\(0.85 \\dot{n}_{A,0}\\) and the amount converted in reactor R2 is \\(0.05 \\dot{n}_{A,0}\\). The volumes of the two reactors can then be added to find the total volume for this scenario.\n\\[\nV_{\\text{scenario }3} = V_{R1} +  V_{R2} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.85 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{85\\%}} + \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.05 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}}\n\\]\nThe expression for the total reactor volume for secenario 1 or secenario 2 can be split into two terms.\n\\[\nV_{\\text{scenario }1} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.85 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}} + \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{0.05 \\dot{n}_{A,0}}{r_{90\\%}}\n\\]\nComparing the total volume for scenario 1 to the total volume for secnario 3, the second terms in the expressions are equal. However, the first term in the expression for scenario 3 is smaller than that for scenario 1 because \\(r_{85\\%}\\) is larger than \\(r_{90\\%}\\).\nThese three scenarios show that there must be a minimum total reactor volume. That is, starting from the extreme where reactor R1 represents 0% of the total reactor volume and moving to the intermediate scenario results in a decrease in the total volume. Then, upon moving to the other extreme, the total reactor volume increases. Thus, while the intermediate point may not be the minimum total reactor volume, the fact that it is smaller than either of the extremes shows that there must be a minimum total volume somewhere between the extremes.\nIt is important to note that the preceding qualitative analysis assumed that the final overall conversion was greater than the conversion where the rate reaches its maximum value. If, instead, the final overall conversion was less than or equal to the conversion where the rate is at its maximum, then the rate at all other overall conversions would be smaller than the rate at the final overall conversion. By the same reasoning as used above, in this case the smallest total reactor volume would correspond to a single CSTR operating at the final overall conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nAs formulated here, the completion of the assignment required the reactor design equations for the two reactors to be solved simultaneously. An alternative approach would be to choose a range of values of \\(V_{R1}\\), calculate the corresponding values of \\(V_{R1}\\) by solving the design equations, and finding the optimum volumes as was done above. With that approach, for each value of \\(V_{R1}\\), the design equations for reactor R1 could have been solved independently and then, using the results, the design equations for reactor R2 could have been solved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.4 Comparing Two Unequally Sized PFRs in Parallel with Equal Flows and Equal Space Times\nA liquid phase process that uses a 60 dm3 PFR is going to be shut down so that a second 40 dm3 PFR can be added to increase throughput. Space constraints dictate that the second reactor will be added in parallel with the first. The design calls for processing a feed solution containing 1 mol L-1 of A at 60 °C and flowing at a rate of 0.55 dm3 min-1. The solution density may be assumed to be constant. The reactors will operate adiabatically, at steady state, and with negligible pressure drop. The reaction is irreversible, and the reaction rate is given in equation (2) where k0 = 2.63 x 107 L mol-1 min-1 and E = 62 kJ mol-1. The heat of reaction and the heat capacity of the solution may be assumed to be constant and equal to -35 kJ mol-1 and 800 J L-1 K-1, respectively.

The PFRs are both adiabatic and operate at steady-state with negligible pressure drop. They are processing the same feed, differing only in the volumetric flow rate entering the PFR and the PFR volume. I can generate one set of reactor design equations to model both PFRs. I’ll just need to set the inlet volumetric flow rate and the reactor volume to the appropriate values.\nThe general form of the steady-state PFR mole balance is given in Equation 6.39. For this assignment I don’t know the reactor lengths or diameters, only their volumes. However, since they are adiabatic, I can re-write the equations using the reactor volume as the dependent variable. After doing that by noting that \\(dV = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz\\), I won’t need to know the diameters or lengths. At the same time, I can expand the summation over the reactions. Here it will expand to a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_i}{dV}  = \\nu_{i,1}r_1\n\\]\nThe general form of the steady-state PFR reacting fluid energy balance is given in equation Equation 6.40. Since the reactors are adiabatic, the heat transfer term goes to zero. After eliminating it, I can again re-write the equation using the reactor volume as the dependent variable. At the same time, I can expand the sum over the reactions, and I can re-write the sensible heat term using the volumetric heat capacity provided in the problem statement. Finally, I can rearrange the equation into the form of a derivative expression.\n\\[\n\\cancelto{\\dot{V}\\breve{C}_p}{\\left(\\sum_i \\dot{n}_i \\hat{C}_{p,i} \\right)} \\frac{d T}{d z} = \\cancelto{0}{\\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right)} - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\cancelto{r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dV} =  \\frac{- r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\dot{V} \\breve{C}_p}\n\\]\nThe reacting fluid in this system is a liquid. It can be assumed to be incompressible in which case the volumetric flow rate appearing in the enerby balance will equal the inlet volumetric flow rate. That is, when modeling reactor R1, it will equal \\(\\dot{V}_1\\), and when modeling reactor R2, it will equal \\(\\dot{V}_2\\)\nSince there is negligible pressure drop, I don’t need to write a momentum balance on the PFR. I’ll likely also need mole and energy balances on the stream splitter and the stream mixer. I’m not going to write them at this point, but instead will wait until I need them.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations on A, Y, and Z for either PFR are presented in equations (3), (4), and (5), and an energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (6).\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_A}{dV}  = -2r_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_Y}{dV}  = r_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot{n}_Z}{dV}  = r_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dV} =  \\frac{- r_1 \\Delta H_1}{\\dot{V} \\breve{C}_p} \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations for each PFR are IVODEs. There are four of them and they contain four dependent variables, so I don’t need to add an IVODE or eliminate a dependent variable. Since they are IVODEs, I do need initial values and a stopping criterion, though.\nFor either reactor, I can define \\(V=0\\) to be the inlet to the reactor, and then I can use the volume of the reactor as the stopping criterion. With this definition, the initial values are simple the values of the dependent variables at the reactor inlet. The feed to the process, stream 0, does not contain Y or Z, and neither will the two streams, 1 and 2, formed by splitting it. Thus for each of the reactor the initial values of the molar flow rates of Y and Z are equal to zero.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable 15.4: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (3) - (6) for reactor R1.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(V\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(V_{PFR,1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,1}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.5: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations, (3) - (6) for reactor R2.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(V\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(V_{PFR,2}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,2}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table 15.4 and Table 15.5.\nAt the start of each integration step, the independent variable, \\(V\\), and dependent variables, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\) will be known, as will the given and known constants listed in the assighment summary. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the IVODE design equations (3) through (6).\nExamining those equations I see that I will need to calculate \\(r_1\\) and \\(\\dot{V}\\). This is a liquid phase system, so assuming the liquid to be incompressible, the liquid flow rate will be constant. The value of \\(\\dot{V}\\) will depend upon which of the two reactors I’m modeling and which of the two cases I’m analyzing. Here I’ll just consider the two reactors. If I’m modeling reactor R1, then \\(\\dot{V} = \\dot{V}_1\\), and if I’m modeling reactor R2, \\(\\dot{V} = \\dot{V}_2\\).\nThe rate can be calculated using equation (2), but to do so I first need to calculate the rate coefficient using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, and the concentration of A. The concentration of A is equal to the molar flow rate of A divided by the volumetric flow rate in the reactor being modeled.\n\\[\nk_1 = k_0 \\exp{ \\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{V}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives for Reactor R1\n\\[\n\\dot{V} = \\dot{V}_1 \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_0 \\exp{ \\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)} \\frac{\\dot{n}_A^2}{\\dot{V}_1} \\tag{8}\n\\]\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives for Reactor R2\n\\[\n\\dot{V} = \\dot{V}_2 \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_0 \\exp{ \\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)} \\frac{\\dot{n}_A^2}{\\dot{V}_2} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to calculate the initial and final values in Table 15.4 and Table 15.5. The volumes of the two reactors are known. The splitter does not change the temperature, so the temperatures of streams 1 and 2 are equal to the temperature of stream 0.\nThe splitter also does not change the concentration, so the concentration of A in streams 1 and 2 are equal to the concentration of A in stream 0. The molar flow rate in those streams is that concentration times the volumetric flow rate.\nFor the first case, the volumetric flow rates of streams 1 and 2 are equal. Based on a mass balance on the splitter, the flow rates of streams 1 and 2 must sum to equal the flow rate of stream 0. So, the flow rates of streams 1 and 2 are each equal to one half the flow rate of stream 0. Multiplying by the concentration of A gives the molar flow rates of A for the first case.\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,1} = \\dot{n}_{A,2} = 0.5 \\dot{V}_0 C_{A,0}\n\\]\nFor the second case, the space times are equal.\n\\[\n\\tau_{R1} = \\tau_{R2}\n\\]\nI can substitute the definition of a space time and again make use of the splitter mass balance requirement that the volumetric flow rate of stream 0 must equal the combined flow rates of streams 1 and 2. Rearranging then gives me expressions for the volumetric flow rates.\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{PFR,1}}{\\dot{V}_1} = \\frac{V_{PFR,2}}{\\dot{V}_2} = \\frac{V_{PFR,2}}{\\dot{V}_0 - \\dot{V}_1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{V_{PFR,1}}{V_{PFR,2}}\\left( \\dot{V}_0 - \\dot{V}_1 \\right) = \\dot{V}_1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_1 = \\frac{V_{PFR,1}}{V_{PFR,2}}\\frac{\\dot{V}_0}{1 + \\frac{V_{PFR,1}}{V_{PFR,2}}} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_2 = \\dot{V}_0 - \\dot{V}_1 = \\dot{V}_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}} \\right)\n\\]\nAs before, the molar flow rates of A are simply the concentration of A multiplied by the volumetric flow rate.\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,1} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}} C_{A,0}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,2} = \\dot{V}_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}} \\right) C_{A,0}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values for the Equal Flow Case\n\\[\nT_1 = T_0 \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nT_2 = T_0 \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_1 = 0.5\\dot{V}_0 \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_2 = 0.5\\dot{V}_0 \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,1} = 0.5 \\dot{V}_0 C_{A,0} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,2} = 0.5 \\dot{V}_0 C_{A,0} \\tag{16}\n\\]\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Initial and Final Values for the Equal Space Time Case\n\\[\nT_1 = T_0 \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\nT_2 = T_0 \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_1 = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}} \\tag{19}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_2 = \\dot{V}_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}} \\right) \\tag{20}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,1} = \\dot{V}_0 \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}} C_{A,0} \\tag{21}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,2} = \\dot{V}_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{PFR,1} }{V_{PFR,1} + V_{PFR,2}} \\right) C_{A,0} \\tag{22}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the reactor design equations can be solved numerically for each reactor to get corresponding sets of values of \\(V\\), \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\) spanning the range from their initial (inlet) values to their final (outlet) values. Thus, solving the design equations yields the molar flow rate of A in stream 3 and in stream 4.\nThe conversion can be calculated using its definition, but to do so the molar flow rate of A in stream 5 must first be calculated. That can be done using a mole balance on the stream mixer for reagent A.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Calculating the Quantities of Interest\nSolving the reactor design equations for each reactor yields corresponding sets of values \\(V\\), \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\) spanning the range from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet.

When the flow to the two PFRs is equal, the conversion is 79.4%. When the space times in the two PFRs are equal, the conversion is 80.3%. While the difference in conversions in this example is small, the results nonetheless are consistent with the caveat that mixing stream of unequal conversion should be avoided.\nThe reason is easy to understand from a qualitative perspective. For a typical reaction, the rate gets smaller as the conversion increases. As a consequence, each additional increment of conversion requires a larger volume than the increment before it. When two streams of unequal conversion are mixed, the resulting stream will have a conversion intermediate between the two. If the stream with the higher conversion had only been converted to the after-mixing conversion, the reduction in reactor volume would be more than that needed to convert the stream with the lower conversion to the after-mixing conversion. In other words, the after-mixing conversion could have been attained using less total reactor volume.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE.",

    "text": "18.2 Design of Kinetics Experiments\nThe preliminary analysis establishes a range of temperature, pressure and composition that is suitable and appropriate for running the reaction. The purpose of kinetics experiments is to generate experimental data that span that range of temperature, pressure and composition with sufficient resolution to capture how temperature, pressure, and composition affect the rate.\nThe nature of kinetics experiments is relatively straightforward. Selected reactor inputs are adjusted to pre-determined values, and then an output from the reactor, also called the response, is measured. The first step in designing kinetics experiments is to decide which reactor inputs to adjust so that the experiments will span the desired range of temperature, pressure and composition. The inputs that will be adjusted in the experiments can be referred to as factors.\nThe first factor to consider is the temperature. Kinetics data are typically generated using small, laboratory-scale reactors. Through the use of a temperature controller, it is usually possible to design the experimental reactor so that it will operate isothermally at a temperature chosen by the reactor operator. A temperature controller is a device that continually monitors the temperature of the reacting fluid and adjusts the amount of heating or cooling provided to the reactor so that the temperature remains constant at the chosen value.\nTypically reaction rates are much more sensitive to temperature than to pressure and composition. The Arrhenius expression indicates an exponential dependence of the rate upon inverse temperature. This is much stronger than the composition dependence found in most rate expressions. Consequently, if composition and temperature are varied simultaneously, the strong temperature effect may mask weaker composition effects. This has two consequences related to kinetics experiments.\nFirst, if at all possible, the reactor should operate isothermally during kinetics experiments. If the temperature is varying, either with time or with location in the reactor, the strong temperature effects may mask weaker composition effects in every single experiment, making it extremely difficult to differentiate between the two. Operating the reactor isothermally eliminates that difficulty. Secondly, it is preferrable to use “blocks” of isothermal experiments where all of the experiments in each block are run at the same temperature and each block uses a different temperature. Then within any one block only the pressure and composition are varying and their effect is more easily ascertained.\nThe second factor to consider is the pressure. For liquid-phase reactions the pressure often does not affect the rate and does not need to be adjusted. For gas-phase reactions it usually is straightforward to adjust the system pressure from experiment to experiment. Many different reactor inputs can affect the third factor, namely the composition of the reacting fluid. For example, in a BSTR experiment the composition can be altered by changing the initial molar amount of one or more reagents and by changing the reaction time. In a flow reactor the composition can be altered by changing the amounts or inlet flow rates of each reagent, inlet concentrations and total flow rate. It is important to vary the amounts of reactants and products when performing kinetics experiments.\nOnce a set of factors has been identified, that is, once it has been decided which reactor inputs will be adjusted from experiment to experiment, it is necessary to identify the response that will be measured in the experiments. It should be some easily measurable quantity that is related to the change in the composition from start to finish (or inlet to outlet). There are many possibilities including the outlet concentration of a reagent, the conversion of a reactant, an outlet mole fraction of a reagent, etc.\nOnce the response and the adjusted inputs have been chosen, a set of “levels” must be chosen for each of the inputs. These are the values to which the inputs will be adjusted during the experiments. For example, it might be decided to use four temperature levels of 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C. That means that a set of experiments will be conducted at 100 °C, another set at 110 °C, and so on. Things that must be considered when choosing the levels for each input include the time that is available for doing the experiments and the cost of the experiments (purchase of reagents, salaries for technicians performing the experiments, etc.). Sometimes there can be a trade off between the resolution of the experimental data and the time/cost of the experiments. A design with more levels should capture the effect of changing an adjusted input more fully, but it will require more experimental time and cost more. A design with fewer levels will reduce the experimental time required and cost less, but it may not fully capture the effects of changing temperature, pressure, and composition.\nThe kinetics experiments entail adjusting each of the inputs to one of its levels, measuring the corresponding response, adjusting one or more of the inputs to a different one of it levels, measuring the response, etc. The final decision in experimental design involves which combinations of levels to use to generate the kinetics data. There are a few ways to do this. A common one, sometimes called a full factorial design, simply includes every possible combination of the input levels. Example 18.6.1 illustrates full factorial design of kinetics experiments.",

    "section": "18.3 Parameter Estimation",
    "text": "18.3 Parameter Estimation\nIt is helpful at this point to make a subtle, but important distinction between what will be called “rate expression parameters” and “rate coefficient parameters.” Rate expression parameters are unknown quantities that appear in the rate expression and either are constant or vary only with temperature. An example is a rate coefficient, \\(k\\). Rate coefficient parameters are unknown constants that appear in expressions for the temperature dependence of rate expression parameters. Examples are the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, \\(k_0\\), and activation energy, \\(E\\), which appear in the Arrhenius expression for the temperature dependence of a rate coefficient.\nThe experimental design described above will lead to a data set where every experiment was performed at one of the chosen temperature levels. For analysis purposes, the data are broken into “blocks” such that all of the experiments at the first temperature level are placed in one block. All of the experiments at the second temperature level are placed in a second block, and so on. Once the data have been grouped into blocks like this, data analysis proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, each data block is processed separately to estimate the values of the rate expression parameters at that block temperature.\nThe result of the first stage of analysis is a set of values for each rate expression parameter at each of the experimental temperature levels. In the second stage of analysis, those results are analyzed to estimate the rate coefficient parameters. For example, the first stage of analysis may yield estimated values for a rate coefficient, \\(k\\), at each experimental temperature level. In the second stage of analysis those \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data are processed to estimate the Arrhenius parameters, \\(k_0\\) and \\(E\\).\n\n18.3.1 Estimation of Rate Expression Parameters\nThe first stage of analysis starts by writing a model for the reactor (i.e. the design equations) and substituting the rate expression into that model. Assuming that each kinetics experiments was isothermal, the mole balance design equations can be solved independently of energy and momentum balances. Consequently for kinetics data analysis the reactor model consists of only mole balances.\nThe rate expression is substituted into the mole balances. If the experiments were performed in same-temperature blocks, then the data for each block will be analyzed separately. For the analysis of a same-temperature data block, the rate expression should be written in terms of the rate expression parameters. In other words, the rate expression should contain \\(k\\), and not \\(k_0 \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)}\\). If the experiments did not result in same-temperature blocks of data, then the full data set will be analyzed all at once, and the rate expression should be written using the rate coefficient parameters. That is, the rate coefficient should be written as \\(k_0 \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)}\\), and not just \\(k\\).\nAfter the rate expression has been substituted into the reactor model, the reactor model can predict the response for each experiment if it is provided with the values of the rate expression or rate coefficient parameters. As such, the reactor model can be fit to the experimental data. This is accomplished by varying the parameter values so as to find the the ones that minimize the difference between the model-predicted responses for the experiments and the experimentally measured responses.\nThe fitting of the reactor model to the experimental data is accomplished using parameter estimation software. There are many different software packages for parameter estimation, and a few different ways to go about the task. Three common ways of fitting a reactor model to experimental data are considered here. They involve (a) using a response function, (b) using a linearized model, and (c) using an approximate model.\nUsing a Response Function\nChapter 7 described the structure of a response function. Briefly, the response function contains all of the quantities that appear in the design equations that are known and constant. The arguments passed to a response function as input can vary depending upon the nature of the analysis being performed. In the case of kinetics data analysis, the response function is passed the values of the adjusted inputs for all of the experiments being analyzed, and it is passed values for the rate expression parameters to be estimated. For each experiment (i. e. for each set of adjusted inputs) the response function solves the design equations numerically. Then it calculates the model-predicted value of the measured response. Finally the resulting model-predicted experimental responses for all of the experiments are returned as a vector.\nTo process an experimental data block, parameter estimation software is used. As noted in Chapter 7, the parameter estimation software one chooses to use will expect the response function to have a specific number of input argument, it will expect each argument to be of a given type (scalar, vector, matrix), and it will expect the arguments to appear in the function call in a specific order. When the response function is created, it must conform to those expectations.\nAs an example, in the Python computer language a function named curve_fit can be used to perform parameter estimation. When curve_fit is called, the response function is passed to it as an argument. The curve_fit function expects that the first argument to the response function will be a matrix containing all of the experimentally adjusted inputs. Each row in the matrix corresponds to one of the adjusted inputs and each column corresponds to one of the experiments. curve_fit further expects that the next arguments will be the unknown rate expression parameters to be estimated, each as a separate argument. Finally, curve_fit expects that the response function will return a row vector where the columns contain the values of the response predicted by the reactor model for each of the experiments. In contrast, the Matlab parameter estimation function named nlinfit expects the response function passed to it to have two arguments. The first is a column vector containing all of the rate expresion parameters and the second is again a matrix containing all of the experimentally adjusted inputs. nlinfit expects the response function to return a column vector that contains the model-predicted responses.\nTo estimate the parameters for one of the experimental data blocks, one writes a computer code that calls the parameter estimation software, typically passing as arguments the response function, the adjusted inputs, the experimentally measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameters to be estimated. The parameter estimation software then returns the best values of the rate expression parameters.\nPerhaps the most important aspects of using a response function to estimate rate expression parameters are that it can always be used, and it does not introduce any inaccuracies. Among its downsides, it requires writing code, having access to parameter estimation software, and, in most cases, making a guess for the values of the rate expression parameters.\nUsing a Linearized Model\nIt is sometimes possible to linearize the reactor model and then use linear least squares for parameter estimation. As described in Chapter 6 and shown in [fix example cross-ref], when a single reaction takes place in an isothermal reactor, the composition of the reacting fluid can be modeled using a single mole balance on any one reactant or product. To use this approach to parameter estimation, a single mole balance on one of the reactants or products must be used to model the reactor. Additionally, if the mole balance is an initial value ordinary differential equation (IVODE), it must be solved analytically to obtain an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE). For steady-state CSTRs, the reactor model will already be an ATE.\nThe ATE model then must be rearranged so that by defining new variables and parameters it becomes a linear equation like that shown in Equation 18.1, where \\(y\\) and the \\(x_i\\) represent the new variables and \\(m_i\\) and \\(b\\) represent the new parameters. The rate expression parameters do not appear in the defining equations for the new variables. Additionally, a unique combination of the rate expression parameters must appear in the defining equation for each slope, \\(m_i\\), and the intercept, \\(b\\). That means that if there is only one rate expression parameter, the linearized reactor model is of the form, \\(y=mx\\), and if there are two rate expression parameters the linearized reactor model has the form \\(y=mx+b\\). Generally, when there are \\(n+1\\) rate expression parameters, the form will be as shown in Equation 18.1.\n\\[\ny = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \\cdots + m_nx_n + b\n\\tag{18.1}\\]\nThe adjusted inputs and the measured responses are used to calculate the values of the new variables, \\(y\\) and \\(x_1\\) through \\(x_n\\), for each experiment. Equation 18.1 is then fit to the new variables, e. g. using linear least-squares. If the linearized reactor model has the form \\(y=mx\\) or \\(y=mx+b\\), a spreadsheet can be used to calculate the values of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), plot the results and fit a linear equation to them. Most spreadsheet programs can be used to estimate \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) by adding a trendline to a plot of \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) and displaying the equation for the trendline on the plot.\nIf the model has two or more \\(x_i\\) variables, linear least squares fitting still can be used, and the calculation of the new variables and fitting the model to them still can be performed using most spreadsheet programs. Plotting the results, however, is often not possible or useful.\nIn any case, after estimating the best values for the slopes, \\(m_i\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), their defining equations are used to calculate the best values of the rate expression parameters.\nImportantly, it is not always possible to analytically solve mole balances that are IVODEs and it is not always possible to linearize an ATE model equation. As such, this approach cannot always be used. When it can be used, it offers the advantages of using a spreadsheet to analyze the data instead of writing code and it does not require a guess for the values of the rate expression parameters.\nUsing an Approximate Model (Differential Analysis)\nThe third approach to the analysis of a block of experimental kinetics data can only be used when the data are from a BSTR or PFR. The mole balances for a BSTR or a steady-state PFR are IVODEs. In this approach, a single mole balance on one of the reactants or products again is used. In contrast to the first two approaches, that IVODE is not solved directly. Instead, the value of the derivative is approximated, for example using finite differences (see Appendix B). The resulting approximate mole balance is an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE) that typically is then linearized and fit to the experimental data as described above. This approach is also referred to as differential data analysis.\nThere isn’t any real advantage to this approach today, because it is easy to solve the IVODE form of the mole balance numerically using a computer. In the past, however, computers were not as readily available and it was often necessary to solve the mole balance analytically. By using this approach, solving the IVODE mole balance was avoided. While this makes the analysis more tractable, it is not as accurate as solving the IVODE form of the mole balance. Today differential analysis is sometimes used for a quick, preliminary analysis of kinetics data, but the other approaches described in this section are preferred.\n\n\n18.3.2 Estimation of the Rate Coefficient Parameters\nIf the experimental data consist of blocks of same-temperature data, parameter estimation can be applied to each block separately. After doing so, values for each of the rate expression parameters will have been estimated at every temperature level that was studied. The second stage of the analysis involves modeling the temperature dependence of each of those parameters.\nThis is relatively easy for rate coefficients and for unknown equilibrium constants that are being treated like rate expression parameters. Both of those kinds of rate expression parameters are expected to exhibit Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, Equation 4.8 and Equation 4.12. Example 4.5.4 illustrates the determination of the pre-exponential factor, \\(k_{0,j}\\), and activation energy, \\(E_j\\), using \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data. The determination of \\(K_{0,j}\\) and \\(\\Delta H^0_j\\) in Equation 4.12 using \\(K\\) vs. \\(T\\) data is analogous.\nModeling the temperature dependence of other types of rate expression parameters such as the exponents in a power-law rate expression is more difficult. Power-law rate expressions are empirical, so there isn’t any theory that predicts how power-law exponents should vary with temperature. Plotting them versus temperature may show that they can be treated as constant, or it may suggest some functional form such as linear or exponential. If an expression for the temperature dependence of empirical rate expression parameters like these cannot be developed, it may be necessary to leave them in tabular form and interpolate to find values at temperatures other than the levels studied in the kinetics experiments. This greatly reduces the utility of the rate expression for reaction engineering purposes.",

    "text": "18.4 Accuracy Assessment\nAccuracy must be assessed each time parameter estimation is performed. That is, accuracy should be assessed after the estimation of the rate expression parameters at each temperature. It should also be assessed after estimation of rate coefficient parameters. For the proposed rate expression to be accepted, the accuracy should be high in all assessments.\nAll of the approaches described above for performing parameter estimation can also be made to yield additional statistics that are useful for assessing the accuracy of the resulting rate expression. These include some measure of the uncertainty in each of the estimated parameters (typically the standard error or a 95% confidence interval) and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). The following criteria indicate an accurate rate expression.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), is close to 1.0.\nThe uncertainty in each parameter is small relative to its value.\n\nThe standard error for the parameter is small relative to its value.\nThe upper and lower extremes of the 95% confidence interval for the parameter are close to the estimated value of the parameter.\n\n\nGraphical assessment of model accuracy is also possible. For linear models with two parameters, this was discussed in Chapter 4 and illustrated in Example 4.5.4. Spreadsheet programs can perform the parameter estimation and generate a model plot, \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) of the linearized equation, with a trendline as described above. If the rate expression is accurate, the experimental data in the model plot will scatter randomly about the trendline. The deviations from the line will be small and there will not be any systematic deviations about the trendline.\nFor every parameter estimation method the resulting parameters can be used to calculate the model-predicted response for each experimental data point. A parity plot of the experimental responses vs. the model-predicted responses can be constructed. Additionally, the difference between each experimental response and the corresponding model-predicted response, i. e. the residuals, can be calculated and plotted against each of the adjusted input variables to get a set of residuals plots. In graphical assessment using these plots, the following criteria suggest that the model is accurate.\n\nThe points in the parity plot are all close to a diagonal line (\\(y_{\\text{expt}} = y_{\\text{model}}\\)).\nIn each residuals plot, the points scatter randomly about zero (the horizontal axis), and no systematic deviations are apparent.",

The intended use of the rate expression, and more importantly the potential consequences of accepting an inaccurate rate expression, should be given serious consideration when making this decision.

Preliminary studies suggest that a temperature in the range of 65 to 90 °C will be needed. At lower temperatures the reaction proceeds to slowly, and at higher temperatures undesired side reactions begin to occur. At a temperature of ca. 80 °C, it takes approximately 30 minutes for the reaction to go to completion. The preliminary experiments suggest that the reaction is irreversible and that the rate is not affected by the concentration of the product, Z. It is expected that the reactant, A, will be available at concentrations between 0.8 and 1.2 M. A perfectly mixed, 1 L BSTR is available for kinetics experiments. The reactor has a sampling port that allows the concentration of A to be measured while the reaction is taking place. Design a set of experiments to generate kinetics data that can be used to develop a rate expression.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI am asked to design kinetics experiments, so I need to decide which variables will be adjusted in the experiments. I further need to decide how many levels to use for each adjusted variable and what those levels should be. The problem states that the rate expression developed using these data will be used to design a new process, so I want to be sure to generate a sizeable data set that spans the expected ranges of the adjusted variables and also captures the effects of each of them upon the response. Based upon the information presented in the problem statement, the experimental response here will be the concentration of A.\nReaction rates can be affected by the temperature and the concentration of each reagent present. Here the problem states that the rate is not affected by the concentration of Z, so the temperature and the concentration of A should vary from one experiment to the next. The reactor is isothermal, so the temperature can be adjusted directly in the experiments. The concentration of A will change as the reaction proceeds. This suggests two ways to vary the concentration of A from experiment to experiment. The first is to adjust the initial concentration of A and the second is to adjust the time at which the response is measured. Longer times will lead to smaller concentrations of A because at longer times more of the A will have reacted. I will use both the initial concentration of A and the reaction time as adjusted variables.\nNext I need to decide how many levels to use for each adjusted variable and what those levels should be. Normally I would use levels that span a slightly wider range than the range where the rate expression will be used. Here, however, I’m told that the rate is too low below 65 °C and undesirable reactions occur above 90 °C, so I will choose levels that just span that range. The range only spans 25 °C, so four temperature levels seem reasonable, as does spacing them equally across the range.\nI want to span a range of concentrations that is slightly wider than the expected range where the rate expression will be used. Three initial concentration levels of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 M will do so. Then, in order to ensure that the data are sensitive to the effect of the concentration of A, I will use six levels of reaction time. Noting that at 80 °C it takes 30 min for the reaction to go to completion, spacing the reaction times 5 minutes apart will lead to samples that span a wide range of conversions.\n\n\n\nExperimental Design\nThree reactor inputs will be adjusted in the experiments: the temperature, \\(T\\), the initial concentration of A, \\(C_{A,0}\\), and the reaction time, \\(t\\). The temperature levels will be 65, 73, 82, and 90 °C; the initial concentration levels will be 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 M; the reaction time levels will be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min. All possible combinations of these levels will be studied giving a total of 72 experimental data points.\nIt will not be necessary to perform 72 experiments, however. Using a reactor at 65 °C with an initial concentration of A equal to 0.5 M, six responses can be recorded in the experiment (at reaction times of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min). The number of experiments needed to record all 72 responses is 12. The initial conditions for those 12 experiments are shown in Table 18.1. Each experiment in the table will yield responses at all six reaction time levels.\n\n\n\nTable 18.1: Initial conditions for kinetics experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\nT (°C)\nCA,0 (M)\n\n\n\n\n1\n65\n0.5\n\n\n2\n65\n1.0\n\n\n3\n65\n1.5\n\n\n4\n73\n0.5\n\n\n5\n73\n1.0\n\n\n6\n73\n1.5\n\n\n7\n82\n0.5\n\n\n8\n82\n1.0\n\n\n9\n82\n1.5\n\n\n10\n90\n0.5\n\n\n11\n90\n1.0\n\n\n12\n90\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSome readers might have difficulty with this problem because it relies upon an understanding of how BSTR kinetics experiments are performed and the data they generate, and that information has not been presented yet. BSTR kinetics experiments are considered in Chapter 19. The important aspects of this example are that it was first necessary to decide which reactor model input variables to adjust, and then it was necessary to decide how many levels of each variable to use and what those levels should be. After doing that, the experimental design simply involves performing an experiment at every combination of the adjusted variable levels.",

    "text": "19.1 Laboratory BSTRs\nThe name Batch Stirred Tank Reactor may conjure up a mental image of a BSTR as a cylindrical vessel fabricated from steel, with some means of stirring the contents vigourously. In fact, it is quite possible to use a simple beaker or Erlenmeyer flask placed on a heated magnetic stir plate and equipped with magnetic stir bar as a BSTR. When a round-bottomed flask like that shown in Figure 19.1 is used, the stir bar can be replace by rotating shaft from a motor that extends through a neck and into the flask. The shaft has a paddle on its end that is curved to match the bottom of the flask. As the paddle rotates, it mixes the contents of the reactor. The reactor shown in the figure has two additional necks that can be used, for example, to insert a thermometer and to withdraw samples for analysis. This particular flask has a jacket that surrounds the reactor. A heating or cooling fluid can be circulated through that jacket using the inlet and outlet ports seen on the sides of the vessel. There is also a stopcock at the bottom that can be opened to drain the BSTR when the experiments are complete.\nFor higher pressure reactions, a metal “autoclave” can be used. The top of this type of autoclave is a flange with a gasket that can be bolted onto the reactor to seal it for use at higher pressures. Typically autoclaves can be heated or cooled, and they use a shaft and paddle for agitation. Special fittings or magnetic couplings are used so that the rotating shaft can pass into the autoclave without allowing the high pressure contents to leak out.\nIn fact, devices that do not resemble a stirred beaker can also be used as BSTRs for kinetics data generation. The primary requirement is that the contents of the reactor be perfectly mixed. As an example, Figure 19.2 shows a recirculation loop reactor. Fluid is rapidly recirculated in the reactor by a pump. In-line mixing devices can be placed in the flow path to promote thorough mixing of the fluid. The reactor must be operated at a very high recirculation rate, and for isothermal operation, the pump and other components all must be maintained at the same constant temperature. If heterogeneous catalytic reactions are being studied, a packed catalyst bed can be inserted somewhere within the loop. In this case, the amount of reactant converted during a single pass through the bed should be very small so that the compositions at the beginning and at the end of the bed are essentially equal. In this way the composition in the loop will change with time, but within it, the composition will be essentially uniform everywhere, just as the batch reactor model assumes. A recirculation reactor such as that shown in Figure 19.2 is particularly useful for the study of a single gas phase reaction that involves a change in the total number of moles. In such a system, if the initial composition, temperature and pressure are known, the composition at any other time can be found from a measurement of the total pressure. Thus kinetics data can be measured simply by recording the total pressure as a function of time.\nThe stopped flow reactor, shown schematically in Figure 19.3, is a batch reactor that is especially useful for the study of rapid, liquid-phase, bimolecular reactions. Solutions containing the reactants are fed in separate streams to a small mixing chamber. This chamber is designed so that the fluids enter as high velocity jets. The high velocity of these jets causes instantaneous, perfect mixing as the jets enter the reactor. Downstream from the mixing chamber, but still near to it, a detector is located. Typically the detector is a spectrophotometer. This device shines radiation of a given frequency through the fluid and measures how much of the radiation is absorbed. The frequency of the radiation is chosen so that only one of the reactants or products absorbs the radiation. In this way the response from the spectrophotometer is directly proportional to the amount of that one reactant or product. In a typical experiment the fluids begin flowing and a steady state is established. The flow is then stopped instantaneously, and the response of the spectrophotometer is recorded as a function of time. The instant the flow stops, the volume through which the radiation passes becomes a very small batch reactor.",

The most important assumption is that of perfect mixing. If the reactor walls are transparent or if there is a window in the walls, a “smoke test” is a simple way to check the mixing. To perform this kind of test a small amount of colored fluid is added to the reactor. For a gas phase reactor the added fluid is some form of smoke, for a liquid phase system it is often a colored dye. The contents of the reactor are observed at the instant the smoke or dye is added. The smoke or dye should instantaneously mix and fill the entire contents of the reactor. Importantly, there should not be any “corners” or other locations where the color changes slowly. Locations where the color changes slowly are called stagnant zones. They are places where the mixing is not perfect.\nA second way of testing the assumption of perfect mixing involves performing the same experiment several times. Each time the experiment is repeated, the only difference from the other experiments is the rate of agitation. That is, a different stirrer speed or recirculation rate is used in each experiment. As the agitation rate is increased in successive experiments, a point should be reached where the experimental results are identical to the previous experiment. At that rate of agitation, the assumption of perfect mixing can be assumed to be satisfied. In subsequent experiments where kinetics data are being generated, an agitation rate somewhat above that critical rate should then be used.",

    "text": "19.2 BSTR Kinetics Experiments and Data\nIn a typical BSTR kinetics experiment, the reactants are first loaded into the reactor; this is also called charging the reactor. If the charge to the reactor has not been pre-heated, then once the reagents are in the vessel, it may be necessary to heat the contents to the desired temperature. If the reaction being studied involves two or more reactants, they can be pre-heated separately to the desired temperature before adding them to the reactor. If a catalytic or enzymatic reaction is being studied, the catalyst or enzyme can be added to start the reaction once the desired temperature has been reached.\nIn any of these situations, as soon as the reactor is charged and has stabilized at the desired temperature, the “initial composition” is analyzed. It is important to recognize that for kinetics data analysis purposes, the initial composition is not necessarily the composition that was charged to the reactor, but the composition at the point when the reactor begins to operate isothermally. The kinetics experiment is taken to begin at this instant, and the elapsed time is measured from that instant. Periodically the elapsed time and some quantity that can be related to the composition (the response) are recorded. Each such measurement represents a single data point. The experimental design dictates how long the reaction is allowed to continue, or equivalently, the number of data points generated before the reaction is terminated. As such, each experiment typically yields multiple data points.",

    "section": "19.3 Design of BSTR Experiments",
    "text": "19.3 Design of BSTR Experiments\nThe design of kinetics experiments was considered in Chapter 18 and won’t be repeated here. It was recommended that reactors being used to generate kinetics data should operate isothermally and that experiments should be performed in blocks where all of the experiments in any one block occur at the same temperature. In Reaction Engineering Basics it is always assumed that kinetics data have been generated using an isothermal reactor wherein only one reaction is occurring.\nBriefly, the purpose of kinetics experiments is to generate kinetics data that can be used to develop a rate expression. Generally there will be a critical range of temperatures and critical ranges of the concentration of each reagent within which the rate expression needs to be as accurate as possible. The experiments should be designed so that the temperature and each concentration (or partial pressure) spans its critical range. A factorial design like that described in Chapter 18 and illustrated in Example 18.6.1 can be used.\n\n19.3.1 Adjusted Experimental Inputs\nAs already noted, each BSTR experiment will be isothermal, so one of the experimental adjusted reactor inputs will be the reactor temperature. The number of temperature levels to be used will depend upon the critical range of the temperature. If the rate expression needs to be accurate over a range of 150 °C, a greater number of temperature levels should be studied than if it needs to be accurate over a range of 30 °C.\nIn many cases, the rate of liquid-phase reactions is not affected by total pressure. Nonetheless, the pressure in a liquid-phase system will not change as the reaction proceeds. So if desired, total pressure can be used as a factor for liquid-phase reactions, and different pressure levels can be specified in the experimental design.\nFor gas-phase reactions, the pressure is closely tied to the composition and the total pressure will change as the reaction proceeds if the reaction causes a change in the total number of moles in the system. Since reactor volume and temperature are constant in a BSTR kinetics experiment, the initial composition for a gas phase system is determined by the total pressure and the relative amounts of the reagents.\nTwo experimental inputs affect the composition of the reacting fluid during the experiments. One is the initial composition described above, and the other is the time that has elapsed when the response is measured. In any one experiment, the composition will change continually as the reaction proceeds, so responses measured at different elapsed times during the same experiment will correspond to different compositions. It makes sense to measure the response as many times as possible during each experiment to minimize the time and cost of the experimental study.\nThe number of times the response can be measured may be determined by the time it takes to make the measurement. For example changes in the absorbance of monochromatic radiation can be measured almost continuously, but analysis using gas chromatography may require several minutes per measurement. The temperature of the experiment may also affect the possible number of response measurements. Consider an irreversible reaction. The reaction rate will be greater in experiments where the temperature is higher. As a consequence, the reaction will go to completion in a shorter period of time in higher temperature experiments than in low temperature experiments. That may mean that fewer responses can be measured in a high temperature experiment than in a low temperature experiment.\n\n\n19.3.2 Experimental Responses\nMany different quantities can be used as the experimental response. The only requirement is that it must be possible to relate the measured response to the composition of the system. Obvious choices for the measured response are the concentration or partial pressure of any one reactant or product. Recall from Chapter 3 that knowing the initial molar amounts and any one final amount allows calculation of the apparent extent of reaction, which, in turn allows the calculation of all other final amounts. That said, any quantity that can be used to calculate the apparent extent of reaction is an acceptable response.\nOne other possibility for the measured response from BSTR kinetics experiments is known as the half-life. This response variable is the elapsed time required for the amount of any one reactant to decrease to one-half of its initial value. Measuring the half-life is particularly easy with a stopped-flow reactor like that depicted in Figure 19.3. One simply measures the elapsed time between the instant the flow is stopped and the instant the spectrophotometer signal becomes one-half of its original value. (This assumes that the spectrophotometer signal is linearly proportional to the amount of the reagent absorbing the light.) The analysis of kinetics data where the measured response is the half-life is discussed below.",

    "section": "19.4 BSTR Data Analysis",
    "text": "19.4 BSTR Data Analysis\nTwo-stage analysis of kinetics data that were generated using blocks of experiments was described in Chapter 18. The first stage involves the estimation of rate expression parameters, and the second stage involves the estimation of rate coefficient parameters. The present section focuses on applying the first stage analysis to BSTR kinetics data to estimate the values of the rate expression parameters at each temperature level that was studied experimentally.\nThe second stage of analysis involves fitting the Arrhenius expression to rate coefficient data from the first stage of analysis. As such, the second stage is unaffected by the type of reactor used. The second stage of analysis will be included in the first two examples that accompany this chapter, but estimation of pre-exponential factors and activation energies does not depend upon the reactor type and since it has already been described in Chapter 4 and illustrated in Example 4.5.4 it will not be discussed here. Similarly, assessing the accuracy of the resulting rate expression was described in Chapter 18 and will not be repeated here.\nBSTR kinetics experiment are isothermal, and the reaction temperature is known. Under these circumstances the ideal BSTR mole balance, Equation 6.8, is the only design equation needed to model the composition of the reacting fluid. Since only one reaction is taking place, it is not necessary to use an index for the reaction.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\tag{19.1}\\]\n\n19.4.1 Parameter Estimation Using a Response Function\nThe rate expression parameters in a proposed rate expression can always be estimated using a response function. As described in Chapter 18, a response function must be created that is consistent with the parameter estimation software to be used. The response function should contain all of the quantities that appear in the design equations that are known and constant. It should be passed the values of the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameters being estimated as arguments. Using that information it should solve the design equations numerically. Then it should calculate the model-predicted value of the measured response and return it.\nFor a single reaction studied in an isothermal BSTR, the design equations that are solved within the response function consist of Equation 19.1 written for each of the reagents present in the system. This gives a set of initial-value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). This is the only aspect of the response function that is unique to BSTR kinetics data. (As noted in Chapter 6, it is possible to use just one mole balance to model the system if the apparent extent of reaction is used to calculate the amounts of all other reactants and products.)\nThe response function is then used exactly as described in Chapter 18. One writes a computer code that calls the parameter estimation software, typically passing as arguments the response function, the adjusted inputs, the experimentally measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameters to be estimated. The parameter estimation software then returns the estimated values of those parameters.\n\n\n19.4.2 Parameter Estimation Using a Linearized Model\nIn this approach, Equation 19.1 is written for one reactant or product, it does not matter which. It is solved analytically to obtain an integrated form of the reactor model. This is shown in Equation 19.2 where \\(f\\) represents the function obtained upon solving the mole balance analytically. The mole balance may contain the molar amounts of reagents other than \\(i\\). If so, those molar amounts must be expressed in terms of \\(n_i\\) using the apparent extent of reaction before the IVODE can be solved. It isn’t always possible to solve the mole balance analytically; when it isn’t possible, this approach cannot be used.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad n_i = f\\left( n_i, t \\right)\n\\tag{19.2}\\]\nAssuming that the mole balance can be solved to find the function, \\(f\\), the resulting algebraic/transcendental equation (ATE) is re-written so that by defining new variables, it becomes a linear equation. Sometimes this can be done using only algebraic manipulations. When the integrated model equation contains a fraction with multiple terms in the denominator, taking the reciprocal of both sides sometimes leads to a linearized equation. Similarly, if the integrated model equation contains an exponential, taking the natural logarithm of both sides sometimes leads to a linearized equation as in Example 4.5.4 where a linearized version of the Arrhenius expression was fit to experimental rate coefficient data. It isn’t always possible to linearize the integrated reactor model, in which case this approach again can’t be used. If the integrated reactor model can be linearized, it will have the linear form shown in Equation 18.1 and reproduced here.\n\\[\ny = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \\cdots + m_nx_n + b\n\\]\nThe kinetics parameters cannot appear in the defining equation for the new variables, \\(y\\) and the \\(x_i\\). Additionally, the definition of each slope, \\(m_i\\), and the intercept, \\(b\\), must contain a unique combination of the rate expression parameters; it may not contain any adjusted inputs or the response, and it cannot be a known constant. With those restrictions, the total number of slopes and intercepts must equal the number of rate expression parameters.\nAt this point, the analysis proceeds as described in Chapter 18. The primary advantage of this approach is that the linearized model can be fit to the new \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) data using linear least squares. It is not necessary to write a response function, nor to use general parameter estimation software. As noted in Chapter 18, if there are only one or two kinetics parameters in the rate expression, the linearized model, \\(y=mx\\) or \\(y=mx+b\\), also can be fit to the \\(x\\) - \\(y\\) data using a spreadsheet.\n\n\n19.4.3 Parameter Estimation Using an Approximate Reactor Model\nThis approach is often referred to as differential data analysis. Instead of solving the exact mole balance, Equation 19.1, the approximate form shown in Equation 19.3 is used. The primary advantage of this approach is that it converts the reactor model from an IVODE to an ATE. The derivative can be approximated using backward, forward or central differences (see Appendix B). In the past, before computers were readily available, the derivative was also estimated graphically. That is \\(n_i\\) was plotted vs. \\(t\\), a smooth curve was drawn through the data, and the slopes of tangents to that curve were measured and used to approximate the derivative.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V \\approx \\frac{\\Delta n_i}{\\Delta t} = \\nu_i r V\n\\tag{19.3}\\]\nTo complete the analysis, Equation 19.3 is usually re-written so that by defining new variables it becomes a linear equation at which point the remaining analysis is exactly the same as just described. Of course, if Equation 19.3 cannot be linearized, this approach cannot be used.\nAs one might expect, this approach is not as accurate as using the exact reactor model. As the data become noisier (i. e. the greater the random error in the data), the accuracy decreases. If the noise in the data is very small and the intervals between response measurements are also small, the accuracy can approach the accuracy of analysis using the exact reactor model. Nonetheless, analysis using the exact reactor model is generally preferred, while this approach is often used to perform a quick, preliminary analysis.\nOne variation on this approach uses initial rates. The only difference in the initial rate approach is that Equation 19.3 is only applied at the start of the experiment. As a result, each experiment yields only the value of the rate at the initial conditions. This approach is typically applied graphically by plotting the molar amount of \\(i\\) vs. \\(t\\). The initial slope then can be measured graphically. It facilitates a quick, preliminary assessment of possible rate expressions. As personal computers have become popular and available, the use of this approach appears to have declined.\n\n\n19.4.4 Half-life Methods of Analysis\nAnother method that appears to have declined in popularity is the half-life method. It involves measuring the “half-life” of the reaction as described above. The half-life, \\(t_{1/2}\\), is the amount of time that it takes for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to one-half of its initial value. The half-life method is most commonly applied when the rate is expected to depend upon the concentration of a single reactant, e. g. reactant A, in a power-law fashion, Equation 19.4. This rate expression can be substituted into the batch reactor design equation, Equation 19.1, as shown in Equation 19.5.\n\\[\nr_A = - kC_A^\\alpha\n\\tag{19.4}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = - kVC_A^\\alpha = -kV\\left( \\frac{n_A}{V} \\right)^\\alpha = -kV^{1-\\alpha}n_A^\\alpha\n\\tag{19.5}\\]\nEquation 19.5 can be solved by separating the variables and integrating. The lower limit of integration is that the moles of A equal \\(n_{A,0}\\) at \\(t\\) equals zero, and the upper limit of integration is that the moles of A equal \\(0.5n_{A,0}\\) at \\(t\\) equals \\(t_{1/2}\\). If the reaction order, \\(\\alpha\\), is equal to one, the result is given in Equation 19.6; for reaction orders other than one, Equation 19.7 results.\n\\[\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{0.693}{k}\n\\tag{19.6}\\]\n\\[\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\left(2^{\\alpha -1} - 1\\right)}{kC_{A,0}^{\\alpha - 1}\\left( \\alpha - 1 \\right)}\n\\tag{19.7}\\]\nEquation 19.6 and Equation 19.7 suggest that the reaction order, \\(\\alpha\\), can be determined by measuring the half-life in a series of experiments using different initial concentrations of A. If the half-life is the same for all initial concentrations, the reaction is first order. Otherwise, a log-log plot of the half-life vs. the initial concentration should yield a straight line, and the slope should equal \\(1-\\alpha\\) as can be seen by taking the logs of each side of equation Equation 19.7. Note that \\(k\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) were treated as constants in this analysis, so each block of experiments at a single temperature must be evaluated separately.",

    "text": "19.5 Examples\nAll of the examples in Chapters 19, 20, and 21 involve using experimental data to estimate the rate expression parameters in a proposed rate expression and then assess its accuracy. Here in Chapter 19 the experimental data have been generated using an ideal BSTR. This type of assignment can be summarized as “kinetics data analysis.” When a reaction engineer is given an assignment, one of the first things they need to do is to identify what type of analysis it requires. Instead of repeating how an expert would identify the type of analysis required in each of the following examples, a single expert thinking callout is provided here. Readers should mentally insert this callout at the start of every example in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking after Reading each Problem Statement in this Chapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves “kinetics data analysis.” I realize that because the problem statement includes 3 distinguishing characteristics of kinetics data analysis assignments.\n\nThe problem statement describes reactor experiments involving a known reaction.\nThe data resulting from performing those experiments are provided.\nThe assignment is to generate a rate expression or estimate the parameters in a proposed rate expression and then assess its accuracy using those data.\n\nI know that the preferred way of performing experiments results in sub-sets (or blocks) of the data that each contain a number of experiments all performed at the same temperature. I further know that when this is true, each same-temperature block is first analyzed separately to estimate values of the kinetics parameters at that block’s temperature.\nThus, to begin this assignment I need to do the following things.\n\nSeparate the experimental data into same temperature blocks.\nIdentify (a) the reactor inputs that were varied from experiment, (b) the reactor response that was measured in each experiment, and (c) the rate expression parameters that need to be estimated for each block.\nDevelop a mathematical model that relates the adjusted inputs to the measured response.\nEstimate the rate expressions parameters for each block and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression for that block.\n\n\n\n\nKinetics data analysis using a response function is preferred in Reaction Engineering Basics because it can always be used, and it does not introduce any inaccuracy. For this reason every example in this chapter illustrates kinetics data analysis using a response function. Example 19.5.1 additionally illustrates kinetics data analysis using an approximate reactor model (differential data analysis). Example 19.5.2 additionally illustrates kinetics data analysis using a linearized model.\nAdditionally, the first two examples in this chapter provides data that can be divided into same-temperature blocks, and they show how the results from analyzing each of those blocks are subsequently used to estimate rate coefficient parameters like the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy that are associated with the temperature dependence of the rate expression parameters.\n\n19.5.1 Differential Analysis of BSTR Kinetics Data\nKinetics data for liquid-phase reaction (1) were generated using an ideal, isothermal, 1 L BSTR. Specifically 12 experiments were performed wherein the temperature and initial concentration of reagent A were set after which the concentration of reagent A was measured at six reaction times, giving a set of 72 experimental data points. The rate expression shown in equation (2), where the rate coefficient is expected to display Arrhenius temperature dependence, has been proposed for this reaction. Assess the accuracy of that first order rate expression using a response function and compare the results to an assessment using a differential data analysis.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = k C_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nNote that these data were generated using the experimental design from Example 18.6.1. and the initial conditions from Table 18.1.

I find it helpful to begin any assignment by summarizing the information provided in the problem statement.\n\n\n\nReactor: BSTR\nGiven: \\(V = 1\\text{ L}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{T}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,0}\\), and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\)\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{C}_{A,\\text{ expt}}\\)\nRate Expression Parameter: \\(k\\)\nThe experiments were performed at one of four temperature levels, so four same-temperature blocks of data can be created from the full data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment asks me to perform the data analysis twice. The information above applies for both analyses. I’ll do the analysis using a response function first. To create a response function I need to first write the design equations for the reactor. Since the experimental reactor was isothermal, only the mole balance design equations are needed to model the reactor.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.5.1.1 Analysis using a Response Function\nReactor Model\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 19.2: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3) and (4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{rxn}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen only one reaction takes place in a BSTR, the mole balance design equation is given by equation Equation 19.1. Substitution of the stoichiometric coefficients of A (-1) and Z(+1) gives equations (3) and (4).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThe instant the reaction starts can be defined as \\(t=0\\). The moles of reagent A at that instant can be represented by \\(n_{A,0}\\). The assignment states that the concentration of A was set, so presumably reagent Z was not present, i. e. the molar amount of reagent Z at \\(t=0\\) is zero. The response was measured at \\(t_{rxn}\\), so the stopping criterion is \\(t=t_{rxn}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is \\(t\\) and the dependent variables are \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_Z\\). In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.\nIn this assignment the volume is a known constant. When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the rate coefficient and the concentration of A. The rate coefficient will be known at the time the IVODEs are solved, but an expression for the concentration of A is needed. The defining equation for concentration in a closed system is the necessary equation.\nLooking at the initial values, the assignment provides the initial concentration of A. Again the defining equation for concentratio can be used to calculate the initial molar amount of reagent A. The final time, \\(t_{rxn}\\) is provided in the assigment and will be available when the IVODEs are solved.\nSo, I need ancillary equations to calculate the concentration of A and the initial molar amount of A using known constants, \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), and \\(n_Z\\).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = C_{A,0}V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response function will receive the adjusted inputs (\\(\\underline{T}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,0}\\), and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\)) and the rate expression parameter (\\(k\\)) as arguments. With that, the design equations can be solved numerically using the information just presented.\nSolving the design equations will yield \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_Z\\) at the time the response was measured, \\(t_{rxn}\\). The measured response was the concentration of A, which must be calculated next and returned. Equation (5) can be used to calculate it.\n\n\n\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure:\n\nThe adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{T}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,0}\\), and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\), and the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), are passed to it as arguments.\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities. For example, in this case the variable V can be defined and assigned a value of 1.0 to represent the known reactor volume, \\(V = 1\\text{ L}\\).\nA function that evaluates the design equations given values of the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_Z\\) is defined. It\n\nCalculates \\(C_A\\) using equation (5).\nCalculates \\(r\\) using equation (2).\nEvaluates and returns the derivatives, equations (3) and (4).\n\nFor each experiment the response function\n\nCalculates \\(n_{A,0}\\) using equation (6).\nSolves the design equations using the initial values and stopping criterion in Table 19.2 to find \\(n_A\\) at \\(t_{rxn}\\).\nCalculates \\(C_A\\) at \\(t_{rxn}\\) using equation (5).\n\nThe values of \\(C_A\\) for all of the experiments are returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving created the response function, I can now use it to estimate the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), at each of the experimental temperature levels. To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. I will exectute this program using each of the same-temperature data blocks, and it will return the best estimate for \\(k\\), some measure of the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), for each experimental temperature level.\nUsing the resulting value of \\(k\\) for each data block, I then can calculate the model-predicted response and the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each experiment. Then, as described in Chapter 18, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created.\nTo complete the analysis, I will fit the Arrhenius expression to the resulting \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data. (see Example 4.5.4)\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nFor each temperature level used in the experiments:\n\nPass the response function, the adjusted inputs for that temperature, and the experimental responses for that temperature to parameter estimation software to find \\(k\\), the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), for that temperature.\nUse the resulting value of \\(k\\) to create a parity plot (\\(C_{A,\\text{ expt}}\\) vs. \\(C_{a,\\text{ model}}\\)) and residuals plots (\\(C_{A,\\text{ expt}}\\) - \\(C_{A,\\text{ model}}\\) vs. \\(C_{A,0}\\) and vs. \\(t_{rxn}\\)) for that temperature.\n\nFit the Arrhenius expression to the \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data from step 1a.

The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), is extremely close to 1.0 in all cases, indicating high accuracy. In the four parity plots, Figure 19.4, and in the Arrhenius plot, Figure 19.7, the experimental data points are all close to the line representing the model, again indicating an accurate model. In the residuals plots, Figure 19.5 and Figure 19.6, and the Arrhenius plot, Figure 19.7, the experimental data points scatter randomly about the line representing the model with no apparent systematic trends in the deviations. This, too, suggests an accurate model. Finally, for each estimated parameter, the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals are very close in value to the estimated parameter. That is, the uncertainty in the estimated parameters is small, yet again indicative of an accurate model.\n\n\n\nThe coefficients of determination, parameter uncertainties, parity plots, residuals plots and Arrhenius plot all indicate that rate expression in equation (2) is very accurate when the Arrhenius expression is used to represent the temperature dependence of \\(k\\). Equation (2) should be accepted as the rate expression with 5.03 x 108 min-1 as the pre-exponential factor and 68.5 kJ mol-1 as the activation energy.\n\n\n\n19.5.1.2 Differential Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that in a differential data analysis the mole balance design equation 19.1, is approximated using Equation 19.3. Here I will use backwards differences for the approximation, (see Appendix B).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V \\approx \\frac{\\Delta n_i}{\\Delta t} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nI then need to substitute the rate expression into the approximate design equation for one of the reactants or products and linearize the resulting equation. There is only one rate expression parameter, so the linearized response model will take the form \\(y=mx\\).\nFor each block of same-temperature data, I will need to calculate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) using the experimental data and then estimate the value of \\(m\\). This can all be done using a spreadsheet, if desired. That will yield values of \\(k\\) at each of the experimental temperature levels. The Arrhenius expression can then be fit to the resulting estimated \\(k\\) values.\nHere I will write the mole balance on A, substituting its stoichiometric coefficient (-1) and the rate expression, equation (2).\n\n\n\nApproximate Reactor Model\n\\[\n\\frac{n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i} - n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{i-1}}}{t_i - t_{i-1}} = -k C_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i} V \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at equation (7), I see that it already has a linear form.\n\n\n\nLinearized Response Model\nDefining \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as shown in equations (8) and (9), it can be seen that equation (7) has the linear form shown in equation (10).\n\\[\nx = C_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i} V \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i-1} - n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i}}{t_i - t_{i-1}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\ny=kx \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to calculate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experimental data point.

That is, the uncertainty in the estimated parameters is small. It is not uncommon for the uncertainty in pre-exponential factors to be relatively large.\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficients of determination, parameter uncertainties, parity plots, residuals plots and Arrhenius plot all indicate that rate expression in equation (2) is accurate when the Arrhenius expression is used to represent the temperature dependence of \\(k\\). Equation (2) should be accepted as the rate expression with 4.42 x 109 min-1 as the pre-exponential factor and 74.6 kJ mol-1 as the activation energy.\n\n\n19.5.1.3 Comparison\nThe accuracy criteria suggested that the model obtained using differential analysis and that obtained using a response function were both sufficiently accurate to accept. However, the parameter estimates from the two analyses were not equal. The model that resulted from the differential analysis appears to be less accurate than that resulting from analysis using a response function. In particular in the differential analysis the coefficients of determination are not as close to 1.0, there is more scatter in the model plots (compared to the parity plots), and the uncertainty in the estimated parameters is greater.\nThe same data and the same rate expression were used in both analyses. They differed in the reactor models used. Not surprisingly, the results with the greater uncertainty were obtained using an approximate reactor model. In general, analysis should be performed using the true reactor model (i. e. using a response function) to avoid the additional uncertainty resulting from the use of an approximate model.\n\n\n\n19.5.2 Analysis Using a Linearized Reactor Model\nThe gas-phase reaction between reagents A and B was studied in an ideal, isothermal, 500 cm3 BSTR. In all experiments the reactor was charged with reagents A and B only, but with varying partial pressures. The fractional conversion of reagent A was measured at seven different elapsed times in each experiment. Experiments were performed at three different temperatures. A total of 189 data points were recorded. Use a linearized reactor model to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2) and compare the results to an analysis using a response function. \\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = k P_A P_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 19.5.

To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. I will exectute this program using each of the same-temperature data blocks, and it will return the best estimate for \\(k\\), some measure of the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), for each experimental temperature level.\nUsing the resulting value of \\(k\\) for each data block, I then can calculate the model-predicted response and the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Additionally, as described in Chapter 18, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created.\nTo complete the analysis, I will fit the Arrhenius expression to the resulting \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data.

That means I must use a single mole balance on one of the products or reactants to model the reactor. (Because the reactor is isothermal, I can solve the mole balance independently of the energy balances.) The response in this problem is the fractional conversion of reagent A, so I’ll write the mole balance on reagent A.\nThe mole balance will be a differential equation. I know that I will need to solve that IVODE analytically before I’ll be able to linearize the model.\n\n\n\nLinearized Reactor Model\nA mole balance on reagent A is shown in equation (12), where the rate expression, equation (2) has been substituted into the mole balance.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_AP_B \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to solve equation (12) analytically before I can linearize it. To do that, I need to express every variable quantity appearing in it in terms of the dependent variable, \\(n_A\\), and the independent variable \\(t\\). In any one experiment, \\(k\\) and \\(V\\) will be constant, but \\(P_A\\) and \\(P_B\\) will change as the reaction proceeds. Consequently, I need to express \\(P_A\\) and \\(P_B\\) in terms of \\(n_A\\) and \\(t\\).\n\n\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, the partial pressures can be eliminated, equation (13).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kV\\left( \\frac{n_ART}{V} \\right)\\left( \\frac{n_BRT}{V} \\right) = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}n_An_B \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressing \\(P_B\\) using the ideal gas law introduced the molar amount of B, \\(n_B\\). Next it must be expressed in terms of \\(n_A\\) and \\(t\\). This can be accomplished using the apparent extent of reaction (see Chapter 3).\nStart by expressing the molar amount of reagent B in terms of its initial amount and the apparent extent of the reaction.\n\\[\nn_B = n_{B,0} - \\xi\n\\]\nThen express \\(\\xi\\) in terms of the molar amount of reagent A.\n\\[\nn_A = n_{A,0} - \\xi \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\xi = n_{A,0} - n_A\n\\]\nSubstuting the second expression into the first gives an expression for the molar amount of reagent B.\n\\[\nn_B = n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A\n\\]\n\n\n\nAfter expressing the molar amount of B in terms of the molar amount of A, equation (14) results.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}n_A\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \\right) \\tag{14}\n\\]\nSeparation of variables and integration then leads to equation (15).\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_{A,0}-n_{B,0}} \\ln{\\frac{n_{A,0}\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \\right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\tag{15}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nRearrange equation (15) so only \\(n_A\\) appears on the left side and only \\(t\\) appears on the right.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{n_A\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \\right)} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}dt\n\\]\nThen integrate noting that at \\(t=0\\), \\(n_A = n_{A,0}\\), at any later time, \\(t\\), the molar amount of reagent A is \\(n_A\\), and \\(k\\), \\(R\\), \\(T\\), and \\(V\\) are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.\n\\[\n\\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\\frac{dn_A}{n_A\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \\right)} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}\\int_{t_0}^tdt\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \\left(\\ln{\\frac{ n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  }{n_A}}\\right)\\Bigg\\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\Big\\vert_{t_0}^t\n\\]\nEvaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at equation (15), I can see that the first fraction will become infinite if \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\), and some of the experiments have equal initial partial pressures of reagents A and B. If \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\) then \\(n_A\\) will equal \\(n_B\\) at all times because one A is consumed every time one B is consumed in the reaction. In this case, the rate expression becomes \\(r=kP_A^2\\), so the reactor model is as follows.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_A^2\n\\]\nRearrange so only \\(n_A\\) appears on the left side and only \\(t\\) appears on the right.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}dt\n\\]\nThen integrate noting that at \\(t=0\\), \\(n_A = n_{A,0}\\), at any later time, \\(t\\), the molar amount of reagent A is \\(n_A\\), and \\(k\\), \\(R\\), \\(T\\), and \\(V\\) are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.\n\\[\n\\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}\\int_{t_0}^tdt\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{n_A}\\Bigg\\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\Big\\vert_{t_0}^t\n\\]\nEvaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (16), below.\n\n\n\nIf \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\), separation of variables and integration leads to equation (16).\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \\frac{1}{n_A} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\tag{16}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone just starting to learn about kinetic data analysis might not have noticed that the initial fraction in equation (15) will become infinite if \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\). In that case, the analysis would have failed a little later, indicating that something was wrong. Eventually the new learner might figure out the problem, but this is one of those times when a little prior experience (or the ability to ask a teacher who has such experience) really helps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving solved the mole balance ODE, the next step is to linearize it. In this problem nothing needs to be done. It is already linear. That means that I next need to calculate the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experimental data point.\n\n\n\nIf \\(y\\) is defined as shown in equation (17) for experiments where \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\), or as shown in equation (18) when \\(n_{A,0} \\ne n_{B,0}\\), and \\(x\\) is defined as shown in equation (19), it can be seen that the model for both cases is a linear equation with a slope equal to \\(k\\), equation (20).\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \\frac{1}{n_A} \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \\ln{\\frac{n_{A,0}\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \\right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-t\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} \\tag{19}\n\\]\n\\[\ny=kx \\tag{20}\n\\]\nAncillary Equations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that I have a linearized model, I need to calculate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for every experiment and then fit equation (20) to the resulting data. Looking at equations (17) through (19) I see that to calculate \\(y\\) I will need the initial molar amounts of reagents A and B and the final amount of reagent A. The initial molar amounts can be calculated using equations (9) and (10), but I need an equation for \\(n_A\\). The initial amount of A and its conversion are known, and can be used to calculate \\(n_A\\).\n\n\n\n\\[\nn_A = n_{A,0} \\left( 1 - f_A \\right) \\tag{21}\n\\]\nCalculations\n\nFor each temperature level used in the experiments:\n\nCalculate \\(n_{A,0}\\), \\(n_{B,0}\\), and \\(n_A\\) using equations (9), (10), and (21).\nCalculate the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experiment using equations (17) or (18) and equation (19).\nUsing a spreadsheet or linear least squares software, fit equation (20) to the resulting data.\nUse the resulting value of \\(k\\) to create a model plot (\\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) as points and the model, \\(y=kx\\), as a line) for that temperature.\n\nFit the Arrhenius expression to the \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data from step 1c.

This is expected because the same data set and rate expression were used, and neither of the reactor models introduces any approximations. Recall, when a differential analysis was used in Example 19.5.1, there was greater uncertainty in the parameters obtained by differential analysis because differential data analysis uses an appeoximate mole balance equation.\nAnalysis using a linearized model, as in this example, is just as accurate as analysis using a response function. The only issues associated with using a linearized model are that for some rate expressions it may not be possible to solve the mole balance design equation analytically, and when it can be solved analytically, it may not be possible to linearize it. Analysis using a response function can always be used.\n\n\n\n19.5.3 A Gas-Phase Reaction With Total Pressure as the Response\nAn ideal, 100 cm3, isothermal BSTR was used to generate kinetics data for reaction (1) at several temperatures. In a typical experiment at any one temperature, reagent A was added to the reactor at that temperature and a pressure of \\(P_{A,0}\\). Then, to begin the reaction, a sufficient amount of reagent B at the same temperature was added instantaneously to bring the total pressure to 6.0 atm. The reaction progress was followed by recording the total pressure once per minute for 24 min after the addition of reagent B.

It describes reactor experiments, provides the data from those experiments, and asks me to assess the accuracy of a proposed rate expression. I will solve it using a response function. The response function will be passed the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameters as arguments, so I will start by summarizing the information provided in the assignment and identifying those quantities.\n\n\n\nReactor Type: BSTR\nGiven Constants: \\(V=100 \\text{ cm}^3\\), \\(P_0=6 \\text{ atm}\\), \\(T=275\\text{ °C}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{P}_{A,0}\\) and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\)\nExperimental Responses: \\(\\underline{P}\\)\nRate Expression Parameter: \\(k\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the response function, I’ll first need to solve the reactor design equations, so I’ll begin by generating the design equations and formulating their solution. Here the reactor is a stirred tank, so there isn’t a momentum balance. Furthermore, the reactor operates isothermally, so I can solve the mole balance design equations independently of the energy balance design equations. For an isothermal BSTR with only one reaction taking place, the general form of the mole balance design equation is given in Equation 19.1.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThis system has 3 reagents, A, B, and Z, and their stoichiometric coefficients are -1, -1, and 1, respectively. With that knowledge, I can write the mole balances. Defining \\(t=0\\) as the instant reagent B is added and the reaction starts, I can let \\(n_{A,0}\\) and \\(n_{B,0}\\) represent the molar amounts of A and B present at \\(t=0\\), noting that reagent Z is not present at that instant. The response is measured at specific times, \\(t_{rxn}\\), so the stopping criterion is \\(t=t_{rxn}\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balance design equations for A, B, and Z are presented in equations (3), (4), and (5). The initial values and stopping criterion needed for solving them are given in Table 19.10.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = -rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = rV \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 19.10: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations (3) through (5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{rxn}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(n_{B,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is \\(t\\) and the dependent variables are \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\) and \\(n_Z\\). In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.\nThe design equations will be solved within a response function so that the adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{P}_{A,0}\\) and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\), and the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), will be available. When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate them.

Three experiments were performed. The temperature was the same in all three experiments, but the initial concentration of substrate S (mmol L-1) differed. At the start of each experiment product P was not present in the reactor. The reaction takes place in aqueous solution, so the concentration of water may be assumed to be constant. The concentration of product P (mmol L-1) was measured at 10 min intervals during 2 h of reaction in each of the experiments. Use the resulting data to assess the accuracy of the Michaelis-Menten rate expression, equation (2), for this reaction.\n\\[\nS \\rightarrow P + H_2O \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{V_{max}C_S}{K_m + C_S} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 19.12.

I need to write a reactor model (see Chapter 6), use it to create a reactor response function (see Chapter 7 and above), and use that to fit the reactor model to the experimental data (see Appendix L).\nFor an isothermal reactor, the mole balances can be solved independently of the other reactor design equations. In this problem there are three reagents, the substrate S, the product P, and water. However, as the assignment notes, the concentration of water is essentially constant, so I don’t need a mole balance on it. I will use Equation 19.1, reproduced below, to write mole balance on reagents S and P, noting that their stoichiometric coefficients are -1 and 1, respectively.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThose mole balances are IVODEs, so I need initial values and a stopping criterion to solve them. Letting \\(t=0\\) be the time when the reaction started (presumably when the enzyme was added to a solution of substrate), then the stopping criterion for each experiment is \\(t=t_{rxn}\\). I will let \\(n_{S,0}\\) represent the molar amount of substrate at \\(t=0\\). The assignment states that product P was not present at \\(t=0\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on the substrate S and the product P are presented in equations (3) and (4). The associated initial values and stopping criterion are listed in Table 19.13.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_S}{dt} = -rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_P}{dt} = rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 19.13: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3) and (4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{rxn}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_S\\)\n\\(n_{S,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_P\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the response function I will need to solve the design equations numerically. The design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is \\(t\\) and the dependent variables are \\(n_S\\) and \\(n_P\\). In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. The adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{C}_{S,0}\\) and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\), and the rate expression parameters, \\(V_{max}\\), and \\(K_m\\), will be available.\nWhen the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the concentration of S. The defining equation for concentration in a closed system, Equation 1.7, can be used to express the concentration of S in terms of the molar amount of S.\nThe initial molar amount of S is not provided in the assignment, either, but the initial concentration is. Consequently, the definition of concentration can be used to calculate the initial molar amount of reagent S.\nSo in summary, I need ancillary equations to calculate \\(C_S\\) and \\(n_{S,0}\\), using known constants, \\(t\\), \\(n_S\\), and \\(n_P\\).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nC_S = \\frac{n_S}{V} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{S,0} = C_{S,0}V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the design equations have been solved within the response function, the predicted value of the response variable must be calculated and returned.

    "text": "20.1 Laboratory CSTRs\nThere are many similarities between BSTRs and CSTRs. The primary difference is that fluid continually flows in and out of a CSTR. Basically CSTRs are BSTRs with inlet and outlet flow streams. Other than the stopped flow reactor, the BSTRs described in Chapter 19 could be converted to CSTR simply by adding a flow in and a flow out. In the case of the recirculation loop reactor, Figure 19.2, the flow in and out should be small compared to the recirculation flow within the loop. As with the BSTR, one of the most important characteristics of a CSTR is that it is perfectly mixed. As discussed below, when a CSTR is used to generate kinetics data, it is preferable to operate the CSTR at steady state. Consequently, in addition to assessing the mixing before experiments begin, it is also important to verify steady-state operation while conducting the experiments.",

    "section": "20.2 CSTR Kinetics Experiments and Data",
    "text": "20.2 CSTR Kinetics Experiments and Data\nThe nature of kinetics experiments involving a CSTR and the data they generate is different in some respects from a BSTR. To prevent the generally strong temperature dependence of reaction rates from masking weaker composition and pressure effects, experiments should be performed in blocks where all of the experiments in a block are performed at the same temperature. The first two examples in Chapter 19 showed how each block of data can then be analyzed to estimate the rate coefficient at the temperature used in that block. Then, once all of the blocks have been analyzed, the Arrhenius expression can be fit to the resulting \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data to estimate the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy.\nWhen using a CSTR to generate kinetics data, it should operate at steady state. There are two good reasons for this. First, the temperature of the reacting fluid is likely to change during transient operation, and that prevents the use of same-temperature data blocks. Second, when the reactor operates at steady state, data analysis is greatly simplified. Specifically, the steady-state reactor design equations are algebraic-transcendental equations (ATEs) whereas the transient design equations are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). Additionally, when the reactor operates at steady state at a known temperature, the mole balance design equations can be solved independently of the energy balances, so only the mole balances are needed when analyzing steady-state CSTR kinetics data.\nIn a typical CSTR kinetics experiment, the rate of fluid flow into the reactor is set along with the composition of the feed fluid. The pressure and temperature are also adjusted to their desired values for that experiment. Once these inputs have been fixed, the flow rate and composition of the fluid leaving the reactor is monitored. Initially the outlet composition and flow rate may change over time. This indicates that the CSTR has not yet reached steady state. When the outlet flow rate and composition become constant, the CSTR has reached steady state, and the response is measured, and that concludes the experiment. This is very different from BSTR experiments where the response was measured several times during a single experiment. The reason, of course, is that the composition changes during a BSTR experiment wherease nothing changes during a steady-state CSTR experiment. Consequently, the generation of kinetics data using a CSTR typically involves many more experiments compared to when a BSTR is used.",

    "text": "20.3 Design of CSTR Experiments\nIn isothermal BSTR experiments the initial composition and pressure of the reacting fluid and the elapsed time at which the response was measured were the inputs that were adjusted so that the experiments sampled a wide range of compositions. In a sense, the same is true of flow reactor experiments (both CSTR and PFR), but in flow reactors the space time, Equation 6.1, determines how long the reaction is allowed to proceed instead of the elapsed wall-clock time (see Chapter 6). This means that for flow reactors there are more reactor inputs that can be adjusted in order to vary the space time.\nAs noted in Chapter 19, preliminary studies typically define ranges of interest for temperature, pressure, and composition, and the purpose of kinetics experiments is to generate kinetics data that span those ranges. For each factor (e.g. the temperature, pressure, the concentration of reagent A, the concentration of reagent B, etc.) a set of values (also called levels) are chosen that span its range of interest. Increasing the number of levels improves the resolution of the effect of that factor upon the reaction rate. At the same time, increasing the number of levels increases the number of experiments that must be performed. Once the levels have been chosen for each factor, a factorial design like that described in Chapter 18 can be used to specify the experiments that will be performed.\n\n20.3.1 Adjusted Experimental Inputs\nTemperature is always an important factor, and as previously noted CSTR experiments are conducted in blocks where the steady-state temperature is the same for all experiments in each block. The pressure is constant in CSTR experiments, so if pressure is a factor of interest, the reactor pressure becomes one of the adjusted inputs.\nThe concentrations (or, for gases, partial pressures) within the reactor are the ones that need to span their range of interest, but unfortunately they cannot be adjusted directly. Instead, the composition and flow rate of the feed entering the reactor are adjusted. Depending upon the configuration of the feed system, the variables that can be adusted include the molar flow rates of the individual reagents or the volumetric flow rate of the feed and the concentrations of the reagents in that feed. Changing these quantities effectively changes the starting composition and the space time. (This assumes that the same reactor will be used in every experiment so the reactor volume cannot be adjusted to vary the space time.)\n\n\n20.3.2 Experimental Responses\nIt was noted in Chapter 19 that there are many different quantities that can be used as the experimental response. That discussion won’t be repeated here. The response should be a quantity that is directly related to the composition of the fluid leaving the reactor or to the extent of reaction relative to the reactor feed. In other words, after measuring the response and knowing the feed, it should be possible to calculate the concentration of every reagent in the product stream leaving the reactor.",

    "section": "20.4 CSTR Data Analysis",
    "text": "20.4 CSTR Data Analysis\nThe focus of this section is the analysis of a block of experimental CSTR kinetics data where the steady-state reactor temperature was the same in every experiment. Once all blocks have been analyzed as described here, the Arrhenius expression can be fit to resulting rate coefficients for the block temperatures. The fitting of the Arrhenius expression has been discussed and illustrated several times in Chapter 4, Chapter 6, and Chapter 19, and should be familiar at this point. It won’t be repeated again here, but instead, analysis of a constant-temperture block of CSTR kinetics data using the CSTR reactor design equations is featured.\nChapter 6 explained that when a reactor operates at a constant, known temperature, the mole balances for the reactor can be solved independently of the other reactor design equations. Consequently the steady-state form of the ideal CSTR mole balance, Equation 6.31, is the only equation needed to model the reactor used to generate CSTR kinetics data. In Reaction Engineering Basics the kinetics data analysis problems are limited to systems where only one reaction is taking place. In that situation, it is not necessary to use an index to differentiate between multiple reactions, and the steady-state mole balance takes the form shown in Equation 20.1.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_i + \\nu_i r V\n\\tag{20.1}\\]\nWhen a rate expression is substituted into Equation 20.1 it will introduce the concentration (or possibly for gases, partial pressure) of one or more reagents. In order to solve the mole balances for the outlet molar flow rates of the reagents, the concentration or partial pressure must be expressed in terms of the molar flow rates. Assuming liquids to be incompressible ideal mixtures, the volumetric flow rate is constant and the concentration is related to the molar flow rates as shown in Equation 1.15.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\]\nCSTRs operate at constant pressure, and when used in kinetics experiments, the temperature is also constant. For gas phase systems, however, the volumetric flow rate in Equation 1.15 will change if the reaction causes a change in the total number of moles. Using the ideal gas law to express the volumetric flow rate in terms of the molar flow rates yields the preferred expression for the concentration of a gas phase reagent, \\(i\\), shown in Equation 20.2.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_iP}{RT\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\tag{20.2}\\]\nIf the rate expression for a gas-phase reaction uses partial pressures instead of concentrations, the partial pressure is related to the molar flow rates as shown in Equation 20.3.\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot{n}_iP}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\tag{20.3}\\]\n\n20.4.1 Analysis Using a Response Function\nThe analysis of CSTR kinetics data using a response function is analogous to the analysis of BSTR kinetics data using a response function. The only difference is that the reactor model is a set of ATEs that must be solved numerically instead of a set of IVODEs. Briefly, the procedure is a follows. A response function is created. It is passed the adjusted experimental inputs and values for the rate expression parameters as arguments. Within the response function, the reactor model (the ATEs) is solved for each experiment to find the outlet molar flow rates of all reagents. The results are then used to calculate the model-predicted value of the response that was measured in the experiments. The response function returns the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments.\nAs noted, the CSTR mole balance design equations are ATEs that will be solved numerically. See Appendix I for a brief overview of the numerical solution of ATEs. A guess for the unknowns is typically needed when solving ATEs numerically. For this reason, it is useful to also make the experimental responses available within the response function. They can be used to make guesses for the unknowns in the mole balances. While the rate expression parameters are being estimated, the response function is called from within the paremeter estimation software. That software may provide a mechanism for additionally passing the experimental responses to the response function as arguments. If it doesn’t, they could be read from a file within the response function. Just as the exact calling and return variables depend upon the parameter estimation software, so does the mechanism for making the experimental responses available within the response function.\nThe response function is then provided to parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses, and a guess for the parameters. The parameter estimation software returns the estimated values of the kinetics parameters, some measure of the uncertainty in the estimates, and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). The estimated parameters can then be used to calculate the model-predicted responses for the experiments. From these, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created as described in Chapter 18. If the rate expression is accurate, the following criteria will be satisfied.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), will be close to 1.\nThe uncertainty in each parameter estimate will be small compared to the estimate.\nThe points in the parity plot will all be close to a diagonal line (\\(y_{\\text{expt}} = y_{\\text{model}}\\)).\nIn each residuals plot, the points will scatter randomly about zero (the horizontal axis), and no systematic deviations will be apparent.\n\n\n\n20.4.2 Analysis Using a Linearized Model\nWhen only one reaction is taking place, as is the case in Reaction Engineering Basics kinetics data analysis problems, the reactor can be modeled using only one mole balance on a reactant or product in the reaction. When this is done, the apparent extent of reaction is used to relate the amounts of all other reagents to the reagent for which the mole balance is written. If that one mole balance can be rearranged into a linear form, the model can be fit to the experimental data using linear least squares. This was described and illustrated in Chapter 18 and Chapter 19 and won’t be repeated or illustrated in this chapter.\nOne point to note, however, is that with CSTR kinetics data, the mole balance is already an ATE. It isn’t necessary to integrate an IVODE before linearizing it. Indeed, for a simple rate expression with only one rate coefficient of the form shown in Equation 20.4, the mole balance, Equation 20.1, will already have the linear form shown in Equation 20.5 if \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are defined as shown in Equation 20.6 and Equation 20.7.\n\\[\nr = kf\\left(\\dot{n}_i,P\\right)\n\\tag{20.4}\\]\n\\[\ny=kx\n\\tag{20.5}\\]\n\\[\ny = \\dot{n}_i - \\dot{n}_{i,in}\n\\tag{20.6}\\]\n\\[\nx=\\nu_i V f\\left(\\dot{n}_i,P\\right)\n\\tag{20.7}\\]",

    "text": "20.5 Examples\nThe start of the Examples section of Chapter 19 noted that before a reaction engineer can solve a problem, they must identify what type of problem it is. The following callout was provided with the suggestion that the reader mentally insert it at the start of every example in that chapter and in Chapter 20 and Chapter 21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking after Reading each Problem Statement in this Chapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves “kinetics data analysis.” I realize that because the problem statement includes 3 distinguishing characteristics of kinetics data analysis assignments.\n\nThe problem statement describes reactor experiments involving a known reaction.\nThe data resulting from performing those experiments are provided.\nThe assignment is to generate a rate expression or estimate the parameters in a proposed rate expression and then assess its accuracy using those data.\n\nI know that the preferred way of performing experiments results in sub-sets (or blocks) of the data that each contain a number of experiments all performed at the same temperature. I further know that when this is true, each same-temperature block is first analyzed separately to estimate values of the kinetics parameters at that block’s temperature.\nThus, to begin this assignment I need to do the following things.\n\nSeparate the experimental data into same temperature blocks.\nIdentify (a) the reactor inputs that were varied from experiment, (b) the reactor response that was measured in each experiment, and (c) the rate expression parameters that need to be estimated for each block.\nDevelop a mathematical model that relates the adjusted inputs to the measured response.\nEstimate the rate expressions parameters for each block and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression for that block.\n\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that each of the examples in this chapter present only a single constant-temperature block of data and ask that those data be used to assess the accuracy of a rate expression with respect to the concentration dependence of a rate expression. This is intentional. Two of the four examples in Chapter 19 illustrated the second phase of the analysis where the Arrhenius expression was fit to the rate coefficients found by fitting the reactor model to the experimental data. By now, the reader should know how to fit the Arrhenius expression to \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data. The examples here focus exclusively on fitting a CSTR reactor model to CSTR kinetics data with the assumption that the reader already knows how to process the resulting rate coefficients and estimate their pre-exponential factor and activation energy.\n\n20.5.1 Analysis of Data for Liquid-Phase Reaction\nThe liquid-phase reaction between reactants A and B, reaction (1), was studied in a 100 cm3 laboratory CSTR. The reactor operated at steady state, and kinetics data were generated in blocks where the temperature was the same in all of the experiments in any one block. In each block the volumetric flow rate and the inlet concentrations of each of the reagents were adjusted, and the outlet concentration of reagent Y was measured. The data from a block of experiments where the temperature was 35 °C are presented below. Use those data to assess the accuracy with which the rate expression shown in equation (2) describes the composition dependence of the rate of reaction (1).\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = kC_AC_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 20.1.

It describes a CSTR and experiments performed using it, provides the data from the experiments and asks me to assess a rate expression proposed for the reaction taking place during the experiments. To solve it I will need to create a response function, and that function will be passed the adjusted inputs and rate expression parameter and return predicted values of the response. To begin, I’ll summarize the information provided in the problem statement, identifying those different groups of variables.\n\n\n\nReactor: CSTR\nGiven: \\(V=100 \\text{ cm}^3\\) and \\(T=\\left( 35 + 273.15 \\right) \\text{ K}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{B,in}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{Y,in}\\), and \\(\\underline{C}_{Z,in}\\)\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{C}_{Y,out}\\)\nRate Expression Parameter: \\(k\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that in kinetics data analysis problems I need to create a response function, and within that function, I need to solve the reactor model equations. Since the steady-state temperature of the reacting fluid is known, I can model the reactor using only mole balances. There are four reagents, A, B, Y, and Z, so I’ll write the mole balance, Equation 20.1, for each of them.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_i + \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficients of A and B are -1 and the stoichiometric coefficients of Y and Z are +1, leading to equations (3) through (6).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on the four reagents are shown in equations (3) through (6).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A - rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{B,in} - \\dot{n}_B - rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Y,in} - \\dot{n}_Y + rV \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Z,in} - \\dot{n}_Z + rV \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations are ATEs. Within the response function I will need to solve them numerically for the four outlet molar flow rates, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\). In order to solve those ATEs, I need to go through them and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets substituted into them, in terms of known constants and those 4 unknowns.\nThe adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameter will be available within the response function. Looking at the design equations, the volume is a known constant. The inlet molar flow rates of each reagent also appear in the design equations, so I’ll need ancillary equations for calculating them from known constants and the four unknowns. When the rate expression is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the concentrations of A and B, so expressions for them will be needed, too. In all cases, I will be able to use the defining equation for concentration in an open system, Equation 1.15.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,in} = C_{A,in}\\dot{V} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{B,in} = C_{B,in}\\dot{V} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{Y,in} = C_{Y,in}\\dot{V} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{Z,in} = C_{Z,in}\\dot{V} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{V}} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_B = \\frac{\\dot{n}_B}{\\dot{V}} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nResponse Calculation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point equations (3) through (6) can be solved for the outlet molar flow rates, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\). Within the response function I need to use those results to calculate the model-predicted response. In this problem the response is the outlet concentration of Y, so again Equation 1.15 can be used.\n\n\n\n\\[\nC_Y = \\frac{\\dot{n}_Y}{\\dot{V}} \\tag{13}\n\\]\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure.\n\nThe adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{B,in}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{Y,in}\\), and \\(\\underline{C}_{Z,in}\\), and the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), are passed to it as arguments.\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities, \\(V=100 \\text{ cm}^3\\) and \\(T=\\left( 35 + 273.15 \\right) \\text{ K}\\).\nA function is defined that evaluates the reactor equation residuals (the right-hand sides of equations (3) through (6)), given values of the unknowns, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\).

To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. It will return the best estimate for \\(k\\), some measure of the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\).\nUsing the resulting value of \\(k\\), I can calculate the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments using the response function. Then, knowing the model-predicted responses I can calculate the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Finally, as described in Chapter 18, I can create a parity plot and residuals plots.\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nPass the response function, the adjusted inputs, the experimental responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to parameter estimation software to find \\(k\\), the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\).\nUse the resulting value of \\(k\\) to calculate the model-predicted response, \\(C_{y,\\text{model}}\\), for every experiment.\nCreate a parity plot (\\(C_{y,\\text{model}}\\) vs. \\(C_{y,\\text{expt}}\\)) and parity plots (\\(C_{y,\\text{model}} - C_{y,\\text{expt}}\\) vs. \\(\\dot{V}_{in}\\), vs. \\(C_{A,in}\\), vs. \\(C_{B,in}\\), vs. \\(C_{Y,in}\\), and vs. \\(C_{Z,in}\\),)\n\nResults\nTo estimate \\(k\\), the response function described above was passed to parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses and a guess for \\(k\\). The results returned by that software are shown in Table 20.2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 20.2: Parameter estimation results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n798 L mol-1 min-1, 95% CI [744, 856]\n\n\nR2\n0.988\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated rate coefficient was used to calculate the model-predicted response for each experiment, and that was used to calculate the residual for each experiment. The results were then used to generate the parity plot and residuals plots shown in Figure 20.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.1: Parity and Residuals Plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for \\(k\\), 744 to 856 L mol-1 min-1, is approximately plus or minus 7% of its estimated value, 798 L mol-1 min-1. There is some scatter apparent in the parity plot, and the coefficient of determination is 0.988. These factors suggest that the rate expression is reasonably accurate. The residuals plots for \\(\\dot{V}\\) and \\(C_Y\\) show random deviations of the residuals about zero, too. However, in the residuals plots for \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) the residuals at low concentration do not scatter equally about zero. The residuals for \\(C_Z\\) show a definite trend, decreasing steadily as \\(C_Z\\) increases. This suggests that the reaction rate may have some functional dependence on the concentration of Z that is not captured in the rate expression.\n\n\n\nAssessment\nThe rate expression is reasonably accurate, but there are indications that the rate expression may not fully capture the dependence of the rate on the concentration of reagent Z. Rate expressions that include a functional dependence on the concentration of Z should be postulated and assessed to determine whether they can represent the experimental results more accurately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the accuracy of the rate expression is reasonable, but the indication that the rate depends on the concentration of Z is a concern. In a real-world study, there would be blocks of data at other temperatures. If the same trends were observed for each data block, the recommendation to try different rate expressions that include functional dependence on Z would be supported. If none of the other temperature blocks showed these trends, it might be recommended that the rate expression was reasonably acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n20.5.2 Analysis of Data for a Gas-Phase Reaction with Change of Total Moles\nPreliminary experiments have indicated that gas-phase reaction (1) is irreversible and that the rate is not affected by the concentration of the product Z. To generate kinetics data, experiments were performed in blocks where the temperature of every experiment in the block was the same. An ideal CSTR operating at 3 atm was used for all experiments. The feed in every experiment contained only reagents A and B. The space time and the mole fraction of A were varied from experiment to experiment, and the outlet concentration of Z was measured. The block of experiments where the temperature was equal to 450 °C is presented below. Use those data to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2) where the power-law reaction orders, \\(\\alpha_A\\) and \\(\\alpha_B\\), must be estimated along with the rate coefficient, \\(k\\).\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = kP_A^{\\alpha_A} P_B^{\\alpha_B} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 20.3.

Knowing that I will be creating a response function, I’ll start by listing the reactor type, constants given in the problem statement, the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental response, and the rate expression parameters I need to estimate.\n\n\n\nReactor: CSTR\nGiven: \\(P = 3 \\text{ atm}\\) and \\(T = 450 + 273.15 \\text{ K}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{\\tau}\\) and \\(\\underline{y}_{A,in}\\).\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{C}_Z\\).\nRate Expression Parameters: \\(k\\), \\(\\alpha_A\\), and \\(\\alpha_B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to generate a response function that predicts the responses using the rate expression. To start, I need a model for the reactor. Referring back to Chapter 6, I know that when the reactor operates at a known temperature, the mole balances can be solved independently from the other design equations, so all I need here is a set of mole balances for this reactor. The mole balance design equation for a steady-state CSTR with only one reaction taking place is given in Equation 20.1.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_i + \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficients of A, B, and Z are -1, -1 and 1, respectively. The problem also states that the feed contained only reagents A and B, so the inlet molar flow rate of reagent Z is equal to zero. Substitution of those values leads to equations (3) through (5).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on A, B, and Z are shown in equations (3) through (5).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A - rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{B,in} - \\dot{n}_B - rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot{n}_{Z,in}} - \\dot{n}_Z + rV \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the response function I will need to numerically solve equations (3) through (5) for the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, and Z. To do that, I must provide equations for calculating every other quantity in the equations from those unknowns and known constants. So I’ll go through each of the mole balances, and any equations that will be substituted into them, and write equations for the quantities other than the unknowns and known constants.\nAt first, looking at the mole balances, it appears that I’m not given sufficient information, but upon careful reading of the problem statement I see that all of the quantities provided are intensive quantities. When that is true, I can choose the value for one extensive quantity and use it as the basis for my calculations. I’m going to choose a reactor volume of 1 L as the basis for my calculations.\nThe mole balance design equations also contain the inlet molar flow rates of A and B. The problem statement does not provide any flow rates, but having chosen a volume as a basis, I can use the definition of space time, Equation 6.1, (which is one of the adjusted inputs) to calculate the inlet volumetric flow rate. Then I can use the ideal gas law to calculate the total inlet molar flow rate and the inlet mole fractions of A and B to calculate their inlet molar flow rates.\nWhen I substitute the rate expression into the mole balances, that will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. Equations for the partial pressures can be written using the unknowns and the defining equation for partial pressure. The rate coefficient and the reaction orders will be passed to the response function as arguments, so I don’t need equations for them.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nV = 1 \\text{ L }\\left( \\text{Basis} \\right) \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_{in} = V/\\tau \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{in,\\text{total}} = \\frac{P\\dot{V}_{in}}{RT} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,in} = y_{A,in}\\dot{n}_{in,\\text{total}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{B,in} = \\left(1 - y_{A,in}\\right)\\dot{n}_{in,\\text{total}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_A = y_A P = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_B + \\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_B = y_B P = \\frac{\\dot{n}_B}{\\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_B + \\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the mole balances can be solved numerically for the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, and Z.

    "section": "",
    "text": "21.1 Laboratory PFRs\nIn its most basic form, a PFR is simply a length of rigid tubing or pipe. Reagents flow in at one end and out at the other. The key assumption of the PFR model is that of plug flow. As explained in Chapter 6 and Appendix H, the fluid flow velocity is constant across the tube diameter in plug flow. There is no mixing in the axial direction, and perfect mixing in the radial direction. Thus, in contrast to stirred tank reactors, the composition varies spatially in a PFR. That is, as one moves from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet, the concentrations of reactants decrease and those of products increase. (The temperature and pressure can also vary along the length of a PFR, but when generating kinetics data the reactor usually operated isothermally and with negligible pressure drop).\nA second difference between PFRs and stirred tank reactors is that there is no agitation in PFRs. For this reason, PFRs are very often used to generate kinetics data for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Recall, a heterogeneous catalyst is a material that exists as a separate phase from the reacting fluid and that causes the rate of one or more reactions to increase. Most commonly heterogeneous catalysts are porous solids that are immersed in the reacting fluid. It is difficult to agitate the solid particles if a stirred tank reactor is used, though this has been done. When a heterogeneous catalytic reaction is studied in a PFR, the catalyst is typically contained within the reactor tube as a stationary packed bed through which the reacting fluid flows. A section of pipe filled with small pellets or beads that are held in place by screens or other means offers a good mental picture of a packed bed.\nThe ideal PFR mole, energy and momentum balances can be used to model a packed bed reactor. To do so, the combined packed bed and reaction fluid are treated as if they are a single, homogeneous fluid. The most important assumption that this introduces to the analysis is that there are no concentration or temperature gradients at the interface between the solid and fluid phases or within the pores of the solid. In reality, there will be concentration and temperature gradients between the bulk of the fluid and the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst particles, and there will be gradients within the pores of the catalyst particles. This topic is considered in more detail in [fix cross reference]. For present purposes, the important point is that these gradients must be negligibly small if the PFR mole, energy and momentum balances from Chapter 6 are used to model the reactor.",

    "text": "21.1.1 Testing the Ideality of a PFR\nBefore a PFR is used to generate kinetics data, it should be tested to ensure it conforms to the asumptions of an ideal PFR. Importantly, it should be tested for plug flow, and if it is a packed bed, it should be tested for negligible concentration and temperature gradients.\nTesting for plug flow is not easy. As noted in Appendix B, in laminar flow the radial velocity profile is parabolic, and it flattens as the flow becomes turbulent. The Reynolds number, \\(N_{Re}\\), offers a measure of how turbulent the flow is. It can be computed using Equation 21.1. In cylindrical pipes, a Reynolds number greater than ca. 3500 indicates turbulent flow; a much greater Reynolds number is needed in order to approach plug flow.\n\\[\nN_{Re} = \\frac{\\rho vD}{\\mu}\n\\tag{21.1}\\]\nSmoke- or dye-based flow visualizations are useful for gauging the mixing in an agitated vessel, but they are difficult to apply for gauging plug flow. A related approach involves measuring the residence time distribution or age function for the reactor. Doing so is described in Chapter 23. The measured age distribution function can then be compared to that expected for plug flow to determine whether plug flow prevails in the reactor.\nAs noted above, when a tubular reactor contains a packed bed of solid particles, gradients in concentration and temperature can exist within the fluid that is close to the surface of the solid particles. When present, these are referred to as external gradients because they are external to the solid material. A common experimental test for external mass transfer limitations (i. e. for non-negligible external concentration gradients) in a packed bed reactor relies on the fact that for an ideal PFR, the conversion depends only upon the residence time within the reactor and not the linear velocity of the flowing fluid. The external mass transfer coefficient, in contrast, does depend upon the linear velocity of the flowing fluid. Thus, if the conversion changes when the linear velocity is changed while holding the residence time constant, this indicates that the apparent rate is being affected by the rate of external mass transfer.\nOne approach to this test is to measure the conversion at varying fluid velocities with a fixed amount of catalyst and plot the conversion versus the residence time. The experiment is then repeated using a different amount of catalyst. In the absence of mass transfer limitations, the plots should superimpose. An alternative approach is to measure the conversion with a given amount of catalyst and at a given fluid flow rate. The conversion is then measured again using a different amount of catalyst, but with a flow rate that gives the same residence time as in the first experiment. In the absence of external mass transfer limitations, the conversions should be equal. Care should be taken in applying this test, however, because at the very low Reynolds numbers that are often used in laboratory reactors, the mass transfer coefficient depends very weakly upon the fluid velocity (Chambers and Boudart 1966).\nWhen external mass transfer limitations are very severe, a first-order rate expression, Equation 21.2, will be found to fit the experimental data very well. In this case it is more appropriate to refer to Equation 21.2 as the apparent rate expression because the rate it refers to is the rate of external mass transfer and not the rate of reaction. The true rate expression can be first-order, but when external mass transfer limitations are severe, the apparent activation energy, \\(E\\), will be very low (≲ 10 to 15 kJ mol-1). True reaction rates typically have activation energies that are greater than this. This can serve as a warning indicator when kinetics data are being analyzed. If the reaction kinetics are observed to change to first order and the activation energy is simultaneously observed to become small, the kinetics data may contain experiments where external transport limitations existed. There are also computational tests for external transport limitations that can be applied (Mears 1971; Satterfield 1980; Wheeler 1951).\n\\[\nr=k_0\\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)}C_i\n\\tag{21.2}\\]\nMost heterogeneous catalysts are porous solids with very high specific surface areas. Most of this surface area is internal and corresponds to the walls of pores (picture the catalyst interior as looking like a microscopic sponge). The only way for reactants to reach the majority of the catalytic sites is to diffuse into the pore structure. If the rate of the reaction at the active sites is large, this can lead to the formation of significant internal concentration gradients within the pores. For present purposes, the goal is to be able to identify experimental conditions where these gradients are insignificantly small. As a general rule of thumb, internal concentration gradients are more likely than external concentration gradients.\nOne experimental test for the presence of internal heat or mass transfer limitations is to repeatedly measure the conversion using finer and finer catalyst particle sizes. In the absence of internal gradients, the conversion should not depend upon the particle size, but if gradients are present, their effects should diminish as the particle size is decreased. This happens because the diffusional path length becomes smaller as the particle size is decreased. Koros and Nowak (1967) suggest a test where the catalyst is prepared from two powders that are mixed and formed into catalyst pellets. One powder is inert while the other is catalytic. Two or more sets of pellets are prepared using different ratios of the powders. In the absence of internal gradients, the ratio of the observed rates should equal the ratio of amounts of the active powders used to prepare the catalysts. Madon and Boudart (1982) describe a similar test where the catalyst comprises very small active catalyst nanoparticles supported on a porous oxide carrier.\nThere are also a few computational tests for the presence of intraparticle temperature or concentration gradients. For an isothermal reaction, Equation 21.3 can be used to calculate \\(\\phi_s\\). For a zero-order reaction, the effects of concentration gradients in the pores will be negligible if \\(\\phi_s\\) is less than 6. For first order reactions it should be less than 1, and for second order reactions it should be less than 0.3.\n\\[\n\\phi_s = \\frac{r_p^2\\left( -r \\right)}{D_{\\text{eff}}C_i}\n\\tag{21.3}\\]",

    "text": "21.2 PFR Kinetics Experiments and Data\nFrom an operational viewpoint, the procedure for performing kinetics experiments using a PFR is exactly the same as the procedure used with a CSTR. Each experiment will yield a single data point. As with the stirred tank reactors, experiments should be performed in blocks where all of the experiments in a block are performed at the same temperature to prevent the generally strong temperature dependence of reaction rates from masking weaker composition and pressure effects. Similarly, the PFR should operate at steady state so that the temperature of the reacting fluid is constant. Doing so allows kinetics data analysis using only the PFR mole balance design equations (as long as the pressure drop along the length of the reactor also is negligible).\n\n21.2.1 Differential Operation\nThe mole balances for a steady-state PFR are initial-value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). As was the case with BSTRs in Chapter 19, it is possible to analyze PFR kinetics data using an approximate mole balance. This method, described below, is known as the differential method of analysis of PFR data. Unlike differential analysis of BSTR data, if one plans to use the differential method of analysis for PFR data, then an additional restriction is imposed during the experiments. This requirement is that the molar flow rate of each reagent present in the feed should not change by more than ca. 5% between the inlet and the outlet of the reactor.",

    "text": "21.3 Design of PFR Experiments\nIt was noted in the preceding section that the operational procedure for generating kinetics data using a PFR is essentially the same as that for a CSTR. Both of these reactors are flow reactors, and consequently the adjusted inputs and experimental responses are the same. The space time determines the amount of time during which reaction can occur, and the space time is adjusted by varying individual reagent or total flow rates. In principle the reactor volume could also be varied to change space time, but doing so is impractical. The temperature is controlled directly making it easy to generate blocks of same-temperature kinetics data. In a PFR the composition changes continually as the reagents flow through the reactor. The composition and flow rate of the feed to the reactor can be varied so that the concentrations or partial pressures of the reagents each span their range of interest. As with BSTRs and CSTRs, the experimental response can be any quantity that is directly related to the composition of the fluid leaving the reactor or to the extent of reaction relative to the reactor feed.",

    "section": "21.4 PFR Data Analysis",
    "text": "21.4 PFR Data Analysis\nReaction Engineering Basics only considers the generation and analysis of kinetics data for single reactions occurring in isothermal, isobaric, steady-state PFRs. Further, it assumes that the data are generated in blocks where all of the experiments in a given block are conducted at the same temperature. When this is true, each of the same-temperature data blocks is first analyzed separately to find the best values of the rate expression parameters at that temperature. Once all of the data blocks have been analyzed, a second analysis is performed to find the best values of the pre-exponential factors and activation energies/enthalpies for the rate coefficients and unknown equilibrium constants. The second analysis was illustrated in the examples in Chapter 19. It does not involve the reactor model, but instead the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, or the equivalent model for the equilibrium constant, Equation 4.12. As such, the second analysis is exactly the same no matter which of the ideal reactor types was used to generate the data. Since the analysis of the rate expression parameters obtained from the same-temperature data blocks has already been demonstrated in Chapter 19, the examples in this chapter focus upon the analysis of a single, same-temperature data block that was generated using a PFR. However, see the notes that follow Examples 21.5.2 and 21.5.3.\nOnly the PFR mole balance is necessary to analyze a single data block because when the reactor operates isobarically and isothermally at a known temperature, the mole balances can be solved independently of the energy and momentum balances for the reactor. The PFR mole balance was derived in Chapter 6, and the steady-state version is given in Equation 6.39. In Reaction Engineering Basics kinetics data analysis problems, there is only one reaction taking place, so there is only one rate term, making it unnecessary to index the reaction, Equation 21.4.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\tag{21.4}\\]\nThis reactor model is an IVODE, and in order to solve it, every quantity appearing in or substituted into it must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, \\(z\\), and the dependent variable, \\(\\dot{n}_i\\). When a rate expression is substituted into Equation 21.4, it generally will introduce either concentrations or partial pressures. Since this is a flow system, these quantities can be expressed in terms of the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) using Equations 1.15, 20.2, and 20.3.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot{n}_iP}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_iP}{RT\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\]\nIf only one mole balance is being used in the analysis, the concentrations or partial pressures of reagents other than \\(i\\) can be related to the molar flow rate of \\(i\\) using the apparent extent of reaction as described in Chapter 3 and illustrated in Example 19.5.2.\nWhen the reactor temperature is known and only the mole balance design equations are being used to analyze the data, the cumulative reactor volume, \\(V\\), is sometimes used as the independent variable instead of the axial distance into the reactor, \\(z\\). When this is done, it is not necessary to know both the reactor diameter and length, only the reactor volume is needed. Changing the independent variable in the PFR mole balance, Equation 21.4, from \\(z\\) to \\(V\\) is straightforward. Dividing both sides of the equation by the reactor cross-sectional area and recognizing that the cross-sectional area time an increment in the axial position, \\(dz\\), is equal to an increment in the volume, \\(dV\\), leads to the desired form of the mole balance, Equation 21.5.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z} =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}d z} = \\nu_{i}r\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dV} = \\nu_{i}r\n\\tag{21.5}\\]\nPFRs are commonly used to generate kinetics data for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Using the pseudo-homogeneous approximation described in Appendix H, the ideal PFR design equations can still be used to analyze the data. However, it is a very common practice to normalize heterogeneous catalytic reaction rates using the catalyst mass instead of the reacting fluid volume. If \\(\\rho_{\\text{bed}}\\) is the apparent packed bed density, that is the combined volume of the solid catalyst and the fluid per mass of catalyst, the mole balance takes the form shown in Equation 21.6 where the rate has units of mol time-1 (catalyst mass)-1. The mass of catalyst can also be used as the independent variable by simply dividing both sides of Equation 21.6 by the apparent bed density and the reactor cross-sectional area, Equation 21.7 where the rate again has units of mol time-1 (catalyst mass)-1.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}\\rho_{\\text{bed}} r\n\\tag{21.6}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dm}  =\\nu_{i} r\n\\tag{21.7}\\]\nFinally, if the reactor was operated differentially when generating the data, an approximate mole balance can be used, Equation 21.8. This is completely analogous to the approximate mole balance used for analysis of BSTR data. It converts the mole balance from an IVODE to an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE). The derivative can be approximated using backward, forward or central differences (see Appendix B). The approximation of the derivative as the ratio, \\(\\frac{\\Delta \\dot n_i}{\\Delta z}\\), is only valid when the changes in \\(\\dot n_i\\) and \\(z\\) are small. That is why it is necessary to operate the reactor differentially for this type of analysis.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\dot n_i}{\\Delta z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\tag{21.8}\\]\n\n21.4.1 Analysis Using a Response Function\nThe analysis of PFR kinetics data using a response function is analogous to the analysis of BSTR kinetics data using a response function. A response function is created that is passed the adjusted experimental inputs and values for the rate expression parameters as arguments. Within the response function, the reactor model (the IVODE PFR mole balances) is solved for each experiment to find the outlet molar flow rates of all reagents. The results are then used to calculate the model-predicted value of the response. The response function returns the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments.\nThe response function is then used as an argument in parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses, and a guess for the parameters. The parameter estimation software returns the estimated values of the rate expression parameters, their 95% confidence intervals and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). The estimated parameters can then be used to calculate the model-predicted responses for the experiments. From these, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created. If the rate expression is accurate, the following criteria will be satisfied.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), will be close to 1.\nThe uncertainty in each parameter estimate will be small compared to the estimate (so the confidence interval is narrow relative to the parameter value).\nThe points in the parity plot will all be close to a diagonal line (\\(y_{\\text{expt}} = y_{\\text{model}}\\)).\nIn each residuals plot, the points will scatter randomly about zero (the horizontal axis), and no systematic deviations will be apparent.\n\n\n\n21.4.2 Analysis Using a Linearized Model\nWhen only one reaction is taking place, as is always the case in Reaction Engineering Basics kinetics data analysis problems, the reactor can be modeled using only one mole balance on a reactant or product in the reaction. When this is done, the apparent extent of reaction is used to relate the amounts of all other reagents to the reagent for which the mole balance is written. Sometimes the single mole balance can be solved analytically, for example by separation of variables. Doing so yields an integrated mole balance that is an ATE. If the integrated mole balance can be rearranged into a linear form, the model can be fit to the experimental data using linear least squares. This was described in in Chapter 18 and illustrated in Chapter 19 and won’t be repeated or illustrated in this chapter.\n\n\n21.4.3 Analysis Using an Approximate Reactor Model\nThis approach, commonly referred to a differential data analysis, is completely analogous to differential analysis of BSTR data. The one significant difference is that to use differential data analysis with PFR data, the reactor must have been operated differentially when the data were generated. The mole balance given in Equation 21.8 is used. As noted in Chapter 19, the approximate mole balance is often linearized and the analysis is performed using linear least squares. In most cases, differential analysis is less accurate than analysis using a response function or a linearized integrated mole balance. Since differential data analysis was illustrated in Chapter 19, it is not repeated in the examples of this chapter.",

    "text": "21.5 Examples\nThe start of the Examples sections of Chapters 19 and 20 noted that before a reaction engineer can solve a problem, they must identify what type of problem it is. The following callout was provided. It should be mentally insert it at the start of every example this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking after Reading each Problem Statement in this Chapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves “kinetics data analysis.” I realize that because the problem statement includes 3 distinguishing characteristics of kinetics data analysis assignments.\n\nThe problem statement describes reactor experiments involving a known reaction.\nThe data resulting from performing those experiments are provided.\nThe assignment is to generate a rate expression or estimate the parameters in a proposed rate expression and then assess its accuracy using those data.\n\nI know that the preferred way of performing experiments results in sub-sets (or blocks) of the data that each contain a number of experiments all performed at the same temperature. I further know that when this is true, each same-temperature block is first analyzed separately to estimate values of the kinetics parameters at that block’s temperature.\nThus, to begin this assignment I need to do the following things.\n\nSeparate the experimental data into same temperature blocks.\nIdentify (a) the reactor inputs that were varied from experiment, (b) the reactor response that was measured in each experiment, and (c) the rate expression parameters that need to be estimated for each block.\nDevelop a mathematical model that relates the adjusted inputs to the measured response.\nEstimate the rate expressions parameters for each block and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression for that block.\n\n\n\n\nIt was noted earlier in this chapter that each of the examples here illustrate the analysis of a single constant-temperature data block. That analysis yields values of the rate expression parameters at that temperature. Typically, this would be repeated several times using data blocks at different temperatures. Then the results would be collected and used to estimate additional parameters associated with the temperature dependence of the rate expression parameters. Most commonly, the analysis of the individual data blocks yields values for a rate coefficient at each of the data block temperatures. They are collected and used to estimate the value of the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy for that rate coefficient. The Arrhenius analysis, as well as alternative analysis of the data blocks using a linearized reactor model and/or an approximate reactor model are not presented here. For that see Examples 4.5.4, 19.5.1, and 19.5.2.\n\n21.5.1 Kinetics of Gas-Phase Decomposition\nThe gas-phase decomposition of reagent A, reaction (1), was studied 1 atm using a PFR with a diameter of 1.0 cm and a length of 10 cm. The inlet volumetric flow rates of reagents A, Y, and Z, in standard cm3 min-1, were varied from experiment to experiment. In all experiments the outlet conversion of reagent A was measured. The data for a block of experiments at a temperature of 1500 K are presented below. Using those data, assess the accuracy of the rate expression given in equation (2), paying particular attention to whether the expression might not capture possible effects of the concentrations of Y and Z.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = kP_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 21.1; the full data set are available in the file, reb_21_1_data.csv.\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.1: First 8 of the 160 experimentally generated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{V}_{A,in}\\) (sccm)\n\\(\\dot{V}_{Y,in}\\) (sccm)\n\\(\\dot{V}_{Z,in}\\) (sccm)\nfA (%)\n\n\n\n\n30\n0\n0\n99.9\n\n\n30\n0\n50\n93.8\n\n\n30\n0\n100\n83.8\n\n\n30\n0\n150\n75.1\n\n\n30\n50\n0\n91.5\n\n\n30\n50\n50\n82.1\n\n\n30\n50\n100\n74.2\n\n\n30\n50\n150\n64.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a kinetics data analysis assignment. It describes reactor experiments, provides the resulting data and asks me to assess a rate expression. Here I will solve it using a response function, so I need to identify the experimentally adjusted inputs and the measured response. At the same time, I can summarize the other information provided in the problem statement.\n\n\n\nReactor: PFR\nGiven: \\(P=1\\text{ atm}\\), \\(D=1\\text{ cm}\\), \\(L=10\\text{ cm}\\), and \\(T=1500\\text{ K}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{A\\text{(STP)},in}\\), \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Y\\text{(STP)},in}\\), and \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Z\\text{(STP)},in}\\).\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{f}_A\\).\nRate Expression Parameters: \\(k\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the response function is to solve the reactor design equations for each experiment and use the results to calculate the predicted value of the response. The reactor used here is a PFR. The reactor operated isothermally, and there is no mention of pressure drop, so I don’t need a momentum balance, and I can solve the mole balance design equations separately from the energy balances. The mole balance design equation for a steady-state, PFR with only one reaction taking place is given in Equation 21.4.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z} =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\]\nSince there are three reagents in this system, I need to write a mole balance for each of them. Noting that the stoichiometric coefficients are \\(\\nu_A = -1\\), \\(\\nu_Y = 1\\), and \\(\\nu_Z = 1\\) leads to equations (3) through (5). The design equations are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs) with the molar flow rates as the dependent variables and the axial position as the independent variable. I can define \\(z=0\\) to be the inlet to the reactor. The initial values needed to solve the IVODEs are the molar flow rates of A, Y, and Z at the inlet. I can use \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\), to represent those inlet molar flow rates. The reaction stops at the end of the reactor, so the stopping criterion is \\(z=L\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on A, Y, and Z are shown in equations (3), (4), and (5). The initial values and stopping criterion needed to solve them are given in Table 21.2\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_A}{dz} = -\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Y}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 21.2: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, (3), (4), (5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(L\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore I can solve the mole balance IVODEs, I need to go through the equations, initial values and stopping criterion, and any equations that will be substituted into them, and express every quantity that appears in them in terms of known constants, the independent variable (\\(z\\)) and the dependent variables (\\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)). Within the response function, the values of the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameter will be know and constant, so I don’t need expressions for them. I can see that when the rate expression, equation (2), is substituted into the mole balances it will introduce the partial pressure of A, so I need an expression for that. I am given the inlet (standard) volumetric flow rates of the reagents, so I’ll need to calculate the molar flow rates at the inlet, since they are the initial values.\nFor the partial pressure of A, I can just use the defining equation, Equation 1.19. The volumetric flow rates given in the assignment are volumetric flows at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP, \\(\\hat{V}_\\text{ STP}\\), is a known constant, e. g. 22.4 L mol-1, and can be used to calculate the inlet molar flows from the given inlet volumetric flows. (Note that if, instead, the assignment had provided actual inlet volumetric flows, the ideal gas law would be used and not \\(\\hat{V}_\\text{ STP}\\).)\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nP_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A+\\dot{n}_Y + \\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_A\\Big\\vert_{z=0} = \\dot{n}_{A,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{A\\text{(STP)},in}}{\\hat{V}_{\\text{ STP}}} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Y\\Big\\vert_{z=0} = \\dot{n}_{Y,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{Y\\text{(STP)},in}}{\\hat{V}_{\\text{ STP}}} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Z\\Big\\vert_{z=0} = \\dot{n}_{Z,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{Z\\text{(STP)},in}}{\\hat{V}_{\\text{ STP}}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point within the response function, the mole balance design equations can be solved to find the values of the dependent variables, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), at the reactor outlet. Those results then must be used to calculate the predicted value of the response. In this study, the response was the fractional conversion of A, which can be calculated using the definition of fractional conversion, Equation 3.5.\n\n\n\nResponse Calculation\n\\[\nf_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_{A,in}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure:\n\nThe adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{A\\text{(STP)},in}\\), \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Y\\text{(STP)},in}\\), and \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Z\\text{(STP)},in}\\), and the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), are passed to it as arguments.\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities: \\(P=1\\text{ atm}\\), \\(D=1\\text{ cm}\\), \\(L=10\\text{ cm}\\), and \\(T=1500\\text{ K}\\).\nA function that evaluates the derivatives in the design equations given values of the independent variable, \\(z\\), and the dependent variables, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), is defined.

In all experiments the same amount of catalyst, 3.0 g, was present in the reactor, forming a small packed bed. The apparent density of the catalyst bed was constant, and pressure drop across the catalyst bed was negligible. The inlet volumetric flow rate was also the same in all experiments and equal to 0.85 L min-1 at standard temperature and pressure. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, Y, and Z were varied in the experiments and the partial pressure of A at the reactor outlet was recorded. Use the data for a block of experiments at 400 °C presented below to assess the accuracy of the power-law rate expression shown in equation (2).

The response function solves the reactor design equations for the experimental reactor and uses the results to calculate a predicted value for each measured response. Thus, the first thing I need to do is to write the reactor design equations for the experimental reactor. Since the reactor is isobaric and isothermal, and its temperature is known, I can model it using only mole balances on the reagents A, B, Y, and Z. The reaction is catalytic and the size of the reactor is not provided. The mass of catalyst is provided, so I will use a form of the PFR mole balance where the catalyst mass is the independent variable, Equation 21.7, and the rate is normalized by the catalyst mass. The stoichiometric coefficients of A, B, Y, and Z are -1, -1, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dm} =\\nu_{i} r\n\\]\nThe design equations are IVODEs, so initial values and a stopping criterion are needed in order to solve them. At the inlet to the reactor, the catalyst mass is equal to zero, \\(m=0\\), and at the end of the reactor it is equal to \\(m_{\\text{cat}}\\). Letting \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\) represent the molar flow rates at the reactor inlet then leads to the initial values and stopping criterion shown in Table 21.5.\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on A, B, Y, and Z, are presented in equations (3) through (6), and the corresponding initial values and stopping criterion are shown in Table 21.5.\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_A}{dm} = -r \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_B}{dm} = -r \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Y}{dm} = r \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Z}{dm} = r \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 21.5: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3) through (6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(m\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(m_{\\text{cat}}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_B\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the mole balances are IVODEs, I will need to express every quantity that appears in them or is substituted into them in terms of known constants, the independent variable, \\(m\\), and the dependent variables, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\) before I can solve them. When the rate expression is substituted into equations (3) through (6) it will introduce the partial pressures of each of the reagents. These can be related to the molar flow rates using Equation 1.19.\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot n_iRT}{\\dot V} = C_iRT\n\\]\nThe rate expression parameters and the adjusted inputs will be available in the response function, so no other expression need to be substituted into the design equations. However, the initial values are not known and must be calculated. Letting \\(\\hat{V}_{STP}\\) represent the standard molar volume of an ideal gas, 22.4 mol L-1, the inlet volumetric flow rate divided by the standard molar volume yields the molar flow rate. Multiplying that by the inlet mole fraction yields the needed inlet molar flow rates.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nP_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_B = \\frac{\\dot{n}_B}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_Y = \\frac{\\dot{n}_Y}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_Z = \\frac{\\dot{n}_Z}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_A\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{A,in} = y_{A,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_B\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{B,in} = y_{B,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Y\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{Y,in} = y_{Y,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Z\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{Z,in} = y_{Z,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the information just provided, the mole balances can be solved within the response function to find the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, Y, and Z.

This suggests an accurate rate expression. However, the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals for the parameters are significant compated to the parameter values. This suggests some inaccuracy in the model.\n\n\n\nBased upon the parity plot, residuals plots and coefficient of determination, the rate expression in equation (2) accurately predicts the experimental results when the parameters have the values shown in Table 21.6. The confidence intervals are not narrow relative to the parameters’ values, but they are acceptable. It is possible that additional experiments at different conditions would tighten the confidence intervals for the parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose similar blocks of experimental data had been generated at several other temperatures and that equation (2) had been found to be accurate at those temperatures. The next step would be to assess how well the rate expression captures the temperature dependence of the rate. For the rate coefficient, \\(k\\), this would be done by fitting the Arrhenius expression to the set of values of \\(k\\) from each of the data blocks.\nHowever, there isn’t any theoretical or empirical basis for assuming that \\(\\alpha_A\\), \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\) obey the Arrhenius expression. In fact, it isn’t known how these parameters might vary with temperature. This is a disadvantage of using an empirical power-law rate expression.\nIf the estimated value of \\(\\alpha_A\\) was effectively the same at every temperature and the same was true for \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\), then they could be taken to be constant and the accuracy of the rate expression could be assessed by fitting the Arrhenius expression to the \\(k\\) values. In other words, the only temperature-dependent kinetics parameter would be \\(k\\). If it was accurate, equation (2) would be useful as a rate expression.\nHowever, if the estimated values of \\(\\alpha_A\\), \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\) vary with temperature it would necessary to (a) find expressions that predict their variation with temperature and (b) assess the accuracy of those expressions.\nIf expressions for the temperature dependence of \\(\\alpha_A\\), \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\) could not be found, then in order to use the rate expression in equation (2) a table of their values vs. temperature would be necessary. Interpolation would need to be used for temperatures not in the table. In this scenario, equation (2) would not be very useful, even if it was very accurate in representing the individual data blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n21.5.3 Mechanistic Kinetics of a Heterogeneous Catalytic Reaction\nIn Example 21.5.2, kinetics data for reaction (1) that had been generated in a steady-state, isothermal PFR were used to assess the accuracy of a power-law rate expression. In those experiments the same amount of catalyst, 3.0 g, was present in the reactor, forming a small packed bed. The apparent density of the catalyst bed was constant, and pressure drop across the catalyst bed was negligible. The inlet volumetric flow rate was also the same in all experiments and equal to 0.85 L min-1 at standard temperature and pressure. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, Y, and Z were varied in the experiments and the partial pressure of A at the reactor outlet was recorded. Use the data for a block of experiments at 400 °C presented in that example to assess the accuracy of the mechanistic rate expression shown in equation (2). The equilibrium constant, \\(K_1\\), in equation (2) can be calculated from available thermodynamic data. At 400 °C the value of \\(K_1\\) is 12.2.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{kP_{A}P_{B}}{1 + K_AP_A + K_BP_B + K_YP_Y + K_ZP_Z }\\left( 1 - \\frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \\right) \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 21.7; the full data set are available in the file, reb_21_2_data.csv.\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.7: First 8 of the 64 experimentally generated data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyA,in\nyB,in\nyY,in\nyZ,in\nPA,out (atm)\n\n\n\n\n0.3\n0.231\n0.155\n0.314\n0.254\n\n\n0.3\n0.231\n0.234\n0.234\n0.263\n\n\n0.3\n0.231\n0.310\n0.159\n0.262\n\n\n0.3\n0.350\n0.115\n0.234\n0.252\n\n\n0.3\n0.350\n0.175\n0.175\n0.245\n\n\n0.3\n0.350\n0.231\n0.119\n0.251\n\n\n0.3\n0.462\n0.079\n0.159\n0.233\n\n\n0.3\n0.462\n0.119\n0.119\n0.237\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference in this assignment from Example 21.5.2 is the rate expression to be assessed.

With this information, looking at the denominator in equation (2) it is apparent that the terms containg \\(K_B\\) and \\(K_Y\\) will be much greater than the other terms (\\(K_A\\) ~ 10-4 and \\(K_Z\\) ~ 10-2), so the other terms can be eliminated.\n\\[\nr = \\frac{kP_{A}P_{B}}{\\cancelto{0}{1} + \\cancelto{0}{K_AP_A} + K_BP_B + K_YP_Y + \\cancelto{0}{K_ZP_Z} }\\left( 1 - \\frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \\right)\n\\]\nThere is still a problem with the remaining rate expression. Specifically there cannot be a unique set of values of \\(k\\), \\(K_B\\), and \\(K_Y\\) that will minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by any constant, \\(\\alpha\\), does not change the rate. Therefore the rate will be the same if the parameters equal \\(k\\), \\(K_B\\), and \\(K_Y\\) or if they equal \\(\\alpha k\\), \\(\\alpha K_B\\), and \\(\\alpha K_Y\\). In other words, the remaining parameters are coupled. This problem can be eliminated by dividing the numerator and denominator by \\(K_Y\\) and defining two new kinetics parameters.\n\\[\nk^\\prime = \\frac{k}{K_Y}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_B^\\prime = \\frac{K_B}{K_Y}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{k^\\prime P_{A}P_{B}}{K_B^\\prime P _B + P_Y}\\left( 1 - \\frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nAssessment\nThe uncertainty in the kinetics parameters is unacceptable. Some of the parameters in equation (2) may be kinetically insignificant or coupled. It is recommended to repeat the analysis using the rate expression shown in equation (15).\n\\[\nr = \\frac{k^\\prime P_{A}P_{B}}{K_B^\\prime P _B + P_Y}\\left( 1 - \\frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \\right) \\tag{15}\n\\]\nFollow-up\nThe analysis was repeated a third time using equation (15) as the rate expression. The parameter estimation results are shown in Table 21.10. The parity plot is shown in Figure 21.6 and the residuals plots are shown in Figure 21.7.\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.10: Parameter estimation results for equation (15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk’\n5.7 x 10-3 mol L-1 min-1 atm-1, 95% CI [4.18 x 10-3, 7.76 x 10-3]\n\n\nKB’\n1.73 , 95% CI [1.11, 2.7]\n\n\nR2\n0.995\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.6: Parity Plot for Rate Expression (3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.7: Residuals for Rate Expression (15).\n\n\n\nFinal Assessment\nBased upon the parity plot, residuals plots, and coefficient of determination, the rate expression in equation (15) is just as accurate as that in equation (2). In addition, for rate expression (15), there are fewer parameters and their confidence intervals are narrow relative to their values. The rate expression in equation (15) is preferred over the rate expression in equation (2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the rate expression in equation (2) had been found to be acceptable, that similar blocks of experimental data had been generated at several other temperatures and that equation (2) had been found to be accurate at those temperatures, too. The next step would be to assess how well the rate expression captures the temperature dependence of the rate. Unlike Example 21.5.2, all of the kinetics parameters in this rate expression would be expected to display Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, making it straightforward to assess the accuracy of the rate expression with respect to temperature. Mechanistic types of rate expressions have an advantage over power-law types of rate expressions in this regard. With mechanistic types of rate expressions one knows how all of the parameters should vary with temperature, while with power-law rate expressions one does not know how the power-law exponents should vary.",

In these cases in Reaction Engineering Basics the index variable will typically have a prime (\\(^\\prime\\)) and the items to be included in the sum or product will be indicated immediately following the equation. As an example, in the following equation, only the reactions in a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system are included in the summation.\n\\[\n\\dot n_i = \\dot n_{i,in} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\dot \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system.\n \nConfidence intervals for estimated parameters are reported as\n\nvalue, 95% CI [lower_limit, upper_limit].\n\nFor example, \\(m\\) = 10 g, 95% CI [9.3, 11.2] means that the estimated value of \\(m\\) is 10 g with a 95% confidence interval between 9.3 and 11.2 g.\nImplicit equations asking for the value of \\(x\\) that causes some function, \\(f\\left(x\\right)\\), to equal \\(y\\) will be written as follows:\n\\[\nx: f\\left(x\\right) = y\n\\]\nThe maximum and minimum of a variable or function, \\(y\\), are designated as follows:\n\\[\n\\max \\left(y\\right) \\qquad \\qquad \\min \\left(y\\right)\n\\]\nThe maximum or minimum of \\(y\\) with respect to variable \\(x\\) is indicated as follows:\n\\[\n\\underset{x}{\\max} \\left(y\\right) \\qquad \\qquad \\underset{x}{\\min} \\left(y\\right)\n\\]\nThe value of \\(x\\) at which \\(y\\) is maximized or minimized is written as follows:\n\\[\n\\underset{x}{\\arg\\max} \\left(y\\right) \\qquad \\qquad \\underset{x}{\\arg\\min} \\left(y\\right)\n\\]",

Standard heats of formation of many reagents at 298 K are tabulated in various handbooks; selected lists often appear in thermodynamics textbooks, too. Tables of this type should indicate the standard state that has been used for species \\(i\\) and each of the elements.\nThe widespread availability of tables containing standard heats of formation is important because the standard heat of any reaction, \\(j\\), at 298 K can be calculated from the standard heats of formation of the reactants and products in reaction \\(j\\). Specifically, Equation D.1 is used to calculate the standard heat of reaction \\(j\\) from the standard heats of formation of its reactants and products.

Standard heats of combustion are tabulated in handbooks and textbooks, just as standard heats of formation are. Standard heats of combustion are particularly convenient for use with hydrocarbons. If reagent \\(i\\) contains elements other than C, O and H, the table providing the value of the standard heat of combustion should indicate the additional combustion products and their standard states.

    "section": "D.2 Adiabatic Temperature",
    "text": "D.2 Adiabatic Temperature\nConsider an exothermic chemical reaction that takes place adiabatically in a system with no shafts or moving boundaries. Since there are no shafts or moving boundaries, no energy enters or leaves the system in the form of work. As the exothermic reaction takes place, the standard heat of reaction is released. It cannot leave the system because it is an adiabatic process. Consequently, the heat released by the exothermic reaction is converted into internal molecular energy. From a macroscopic perspective the result is that the temperature of the system increases. That is, the heat released by the reaction is used to raise the temperature of the reacting system. This assumes that no phase changes occur as the reaction takes place.\nWhen the reaction process ends, the system will be at a new temperature that is sometimes referred to as the adiabatic temperature. In the case of an exothermic reaction, this temperature will be greater than the starting temperature, and the change in temperature is referred to as the adiabatic temperature rise. For an endothermic reaction the system temperature would decrease, resulting in an adiabatic temperature drop. For the remainder of this discussion, we can generalize by simply referring to the adiabatic temperature change, noting that if the reaction is exothermic it will be a rise and if the reaction is endothermic it will be a drop.\nNotice that one doesn’t need to know anything about the container holding the system, i. e. the reactor, other than it operates adiabatically and without any shafts or moving boundaries. The adiabatic temperature can be computed using only thermodynamic quantities. Typically in reaction engineering, the goal is to calculate the adiabatic temperature change given the starting composition and temperature and the final composition. Knowing the initial and final amounts of the reagents, it is possible to calculate the apparent extents (see Chapter 3) of a complete mathematically independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system. The essential concept when calculating the adiabatic temperature is that the heat released or absorbed by reaction must just equal the change in the sensible heat of the reagents.\nEnthalpy is a state function, so it is not necessary to perform the calculations using the exact path followed by the reacting system. Any path that starts at the same initial conditions and ends at the same final conditions can be used. For analysis purposes, it is convenient to use a pathway where the reactions first occur isothermally at the initial temperature and then the resulting product mix is heated (or cooled) to the final temperature. The net \\(\\Delta H\\) for the two steps is then set equal to zero, giving an implicit equation for the final, adiabatic temperature as shown in Equation D.4 which assumes that no phase changes occur as the reaction takes place.\n\\[\n\\sum_{j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\\left( - \\Delta H_{j^\\prime}\\Big \\vert_{T_0} \\right) = \\sum_i \\int_{T_0}^{T_{ad}} \\hat C_{p,i} \\left( n_{i,0} + \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime} \\right)dT\n\\tag{D.4}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions ocurring in the system.\nGiven only the initial amounts of the reagents and the requisite thermodynamic data, Equation D.4 provides a relationship between the final temperature and the extents of reaction.",

    "text": "D.4 Equilibrium Composition\nKnowing the initial composition of a system, the reactions taking place, the final temperature and, for gases, the final pressure, the equilibrium composition of the system can be calculated. Doing this won’t be necessary in Reaction Engineering Basics, but it is an important skill that a reaction engineer needs. It can be important in the early stages of designing a reactor system and whenever reaction engineering tasks involve reversible reactions.\nThe reactions taking place in the system may not be mathematically independent. The first step in calculating the equilibrium composition of a system is to identify a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place. Appendix B includes a section that describes how to do so. Here, for convenience, the reactions in the complete mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place will simply be referred to as “the independent reactions.”\nHaving identified the independent reactions, an equilibrium expression, Equation D.8, can be written for each of them.\n\\[\nK_{j^\\prime} = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}}\n\\tag{D.8}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions ocurring in the system.\nThe thermodynamic activity, \\(a_i\\), of each species, \\(i\\), in the equilibrium expressions can be related to the composition. For an ideal liquid solution, the activity is simply equal to the mole fraction, Equation D.9. For an ideal gas, the activity is the partial pressure divided by the standard state of 1 atm, Equation D.10.\n\\[\na_i = x_i \\quad \\text{(ideal liquid solution)}\n\\tag{D.9}\\]\n\\[\na_i = \\frac{P_i}{1 \\text{ atm}} = \\frac{y_iP}{1 \\text{ atm}} \\quad \\text{(ideal gas)}\n\\tag{D.10}\\]\nFinally, the mole fractions can be expressed in terms of the apparent extents of the independent reactions. For example the gas phase mole fraction of reagent \\(i\\) in a closed system would be written as shown in Equation D.11. Similar equations are used for liquid phase systems (where \\(x_i\\) is used instead of \\(y_i\\)) and for open, steady-state systems (where \\(\\dot n_i\\), \\(\\dot n_{i,in}\\) and \\(\\dot \\xi\\) are used instead of \\(n_i\\), \\(n_{i,0}\\) and \\(\\xi\\)).\n\\[\ny_i = \\frac{n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i n_i} = \\frac{n_{i,0} + \\displaystyle \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}\\xi_{j^\\prime}}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i \\left( n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}\\xi_{j^\\prime}\\right)}\n\\tag{D.11}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions ocurring in the system.\nIf \\(N\\) is the number of independent reactions, then after substitution for the activities and mole fractions as just described, Equation D.8 can be used to write a set of \\(N\\) equilibrium expressions containing \\(N\\) unknown apparent extents of reaction. Those equations can be solved to find the equilibrium extents of reaction which, in turn, can be used to calculate the equilibrium mole fractions or any other measure of the equilibrium composition.",

Mass cannot be generated (other than by nuclear reactions), so there is no generation of mass within the reactor shell/jacket, either. Consequently the inlet and outlet mass flow rates are always equal, as shown in the figures. Note that the mass flow rate of the heat exchange fluid can vary with time, but any change in the inlet mass flow rate is accompanied instantaneously by an equal change in the outlet mass flow rate.\n\n\nE.1.2 Energy Balance on the Heat Exchange Fluid\nAs noted, in Reaction Engineering Basics the heat exchange fluid undergoes either a temperature change or a phase change, but not both. The form of the energy balance is different for each of these situations.\nEnergy Balance for Exchange of Sensible Heat\nWith the assumptions of no mass accumulation in the shell/jacket and that the heat exchange fluid does not undergo phase change, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid takes the form shown in Equation E.1.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = \\dot Q_{ex} - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{E.1}\\]\nEnergy Balance for Exchange of Latent Heat\nAgain assuming no accumulation of mass in the shell/jacket, and additionally assuming that the temperature of the heat exchange fluid does not change, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid takes the form shown in Equation E.2. Typically, if the reacting fluid is being heated, the heat exchange fluid enters the shell/jacket as a saturated vapor. Within the shell/jacket, some fraction, \\(\\gamma\\), of the heat exchange fluid condenses. This occurs at a constant and known temperature, namely, the boiling point. Less commonly, if the reacting fluid is being cooled by boiling the heat exchange fluid, the heat exchange fluid enters the shell/jacket as a saturated liquid, and within the shell/jacket, some fraction of the heat exchange fluid vaporizes.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} = \\dot Q_{ex} - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\tag{E.2}\\]\nThe maximum latent heat that can be provided or removed corresponds to complete condensation or complete vaporization of the heat exchange fluid. That is, the maximum amount of heat is exchanged with \\(\\gamma\\) is equal to 1.\nIn both Equation E.1 and Equation E.2, the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot Q\\), and the rate of heat input to the shell/jacket, \\(\\dot Q_e\\) are related as shown in Equation E.3.\n\\[\n\\dot Q_e = - \\dot Q\n\\tag{E.3}\\]",

In Reaction Engineering Basics, it is assumed that the overall, local heat transfer coefficient, \\(U\\), is constant along the length of the reactor so that the total heat input to the reacting fluid from the heat exchange fluid is given by Equation E.5.\n\\[\n\\dot Q = \\int_0^L \\pi DU\\left( T_{ex} - T \\right)dz\n\\tag{E.5}\\]\nAs is the case for steady-state CSTR, when a tubular reactor operates at steady state, the derivative in either of the energy balances, Equation E.1 or Equation E.2, is equal to zero.",

They are assumed to be in constant motion, with the full mass of each particle located at a point that is moving in space. Each kind of molecule has its own collision radius. Beyond their collision radii, the molecules exert no forces on each other, but when the distance between two molecules equals the sum of those molecules’ collision radii, they exert an infinite repulsive force on each other. This is commonly described by saying the molecules behave as hard spheres when they collide, but there is a significant difference. Hard spheres can have angular momentum due to spin, and they can transfer angular momentum when they collide. In the kinetic theory of gases, the mass of the molecules is all located at a point, so they cannot have angular momentum. Collisions between molecules are assumed to be perfectly elastic. This means that when two gas molecules collide there is no change in the total translational kinetic energy. As Figure F.1 (a) shows, an A molecule and a B molecule will collide when the distance between their centers equals the sum of their collision radii.",

The development of collision theory begins with the Boltzmann distribution (sometimes called the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) which describes how available energy is distributed within a collection of molecules. For a gas at a given temperature, the Boltzmann distribution tells how many molecules will have a velocity, \\(u\\), which lies in the interval from \\(u\\) to \\(u + du\\).

    "section": "F.3 Collision Theory",
    "text": "F.3 Collision Theory\nThe kinetic theory of gases doesn’t include any attractive or repulsive forces between molecules except at the instant they collide. As a consequence, when an A molecule travels through space (between collisions) its center traces out a straight line (not a curve). This straight line can be used as the axis of a cylinder with a radius equal to the sum of the collision radii of an A molecule and a B molecule, Figure F.1 (b). Thus as the A molecule travels through space it sweeps out a cylindrical volume and a collision will occur if a B molecule has its center within this cylinder. The cross-sectional area of this cylinder is called the collision cross-section, \\(\\sigma_{AB}\\). The collision cross section is calculated using Equation F.3.\n\\[\n\\sigma _{AB}=\\pi \\left(R_A + R_B\\right)^2\n\\tag{F.3}\\]\nIt is next assumed that B molecules are uniformly distributed throughout space. If \\(N_B^*\\) equals the number of B molecules per unit volume, then on average, there will be one B molecule in a volume, \\(V_B^*\\), as given by Equation F.4.\n\\[\nV_B^* = \\frac{1}{N_B^*}\n\\tag{F.4}\\]\nThe cylindrical volume swept out by a single A molecule before it collides with a B molecule will equal \\(V_B^*\\). The distance, \\(L\\), traveled by the A molecule before it undergoes collision can then be found using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, Equation F.5.\n\\[\nL=\\frac{V_B^*}{\\sigma _{AB}}\n\\tag{F.5}\\]\nThe amount of time, \\(t\\), it takes the A molecule to travel the distance \\(L\\) can be found from its velocity, \\(u\\), relative to the B molecule with which it collides using Equation F.6 which is a simple rearrangement of the definition of a velocity.\n\\[\nt=\\frac{L}{u}\n\\tag{F.6}\\]\nThus, Equation F.6 can be used to find how long it takes, on average, for an A molecule to collide with a single B molecule. Substituting Equation F.5 into Equation F.6 leads to Equation F.7 for the amount of time, \\(t_{\\text{single}}\\), required for an A molecule to have a single collision with a B molecule.\n\\[\nt_{\\text{single}}=\\frac{V_B^*}{u\\sigma _{AB}}\n\\tag{F.7}\\]\nThe time calculated using Equation F.7 is the period of the collisions of the A molecule with B molecules. The frequency of collisions of a single A molecule with a B molecule is equal to the reciprocal of this period. This frequency is only for collisions between the single A molecule under consideration and a B molecule. If \\(\\nu\\) is used to represent frequency, the frequency of collisions of a single A molecule moving with a velocity, \\(u\\), is then given by Equation F.8.\n\\[\n\\nu_{\\text{single,u}} = \\frac{u\\sigma _{AB}}{V_B^*}\n\\tag{F.8}\\]\nThe frequency of collisions involving all A molecules that are moving with one particular velocity, \\(u\\), is found by multiplying the frequency of collisions for a single A molecule by the total number of A molecules that are moving with that velocity, Equation F.9.\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{frequency of collisions}\\\\\\text{involving all A molecules}\\\\\\text{that have a velocity of } u \\end{pmatrix} =  \\begin{pmatrix}\\text{frequency of collisions}\\\\\\text{of a single A molecule}\\\\\\text{that has a velocity of } u \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{number of A}\\\\\\text{molecules that}\\\\\\text{have a velocity of } u \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\nu_{\\text{all,u}} = \\frac{u\\sigma _{AB}}{V_B^*}dN_A^*\n\\tag{F.9}\\]\nThe frequency of all collisions between A molecules and B molecules (i. e. with any velocity) is found by summing Equation F.9 over all possible velocities. To do this, the Boltzmann distribution function, Equation F.1, is substituted into Equation F.9 along with substitution of Equation F.4. Since the velocity distribution is continuous, the summation takes the form of an integral over all possible velocities. The frequency of all collisions between A and B molecules is often called a collision number. The symbol \\(Z_{AB}^{\\prime}\\) is used here to represent the frequency of all collisions between A molecules and B molecules, Equation F.10.\n\\[\nZ_{AB}^{\\prime}=\\sum_u \\nu_{\\text{all,u}} = \\sum_u \\left(\\frac{u\\sigma _{AB}}{V_B^*}dN_A^*\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nZ_{AB}^{\\prime}=\\int_{u=0}^{u=\\infty}\\left(4\\pi N_A^*N_B^*u^3\\sigma _{AB}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_BT}\\right)^{3/2}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\mu u^2}{2k_BT}\\right)}du\n\\]\n\\[\nZ_{AB}^{\\prime}=N_A^*N_B^*\\sigma _{AB}\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\n\\tag{F.10}\\]\nSome of the collisions between the A molecules and the B molecules will involve very small relative velocities along the centerline between the molecules. These are cases that involve a glancing collision. Therefore, it is next assumed that there must be some minimum relative velocity along the centerline between the molecules if a collision is going to lead to reaction. Collisions which have at least this minimum velocity associated with them can be called reactive collisions, and their frequency can be represented by \\(Z_{AB}\\) (no prime). The frequency of collisions involving a velocity equal to or greater than some minimum, \\(u_0\\), can be found by replacing the lower limit of the integral above with \\(u_0\\), leading to Equation F.11 for \\(Z_{AB}\\), where \\(\\epsilon_0\\) is the energy corresponding to the relative velocity, \\(u_0\\).\n\\[\nZ_{AB}=N_A^*N_B^*\\sigma _{AB}\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\epsilon_0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.11}\\]\nAn analysis similar to the one just presented can be done for collisions between two A molecules. The primary difference is that one must be careful not to double-count the collisions. The resulting expression for the reactive collision frequency, \\(Z_{AA}\\), is given in Equation F.12. The analysis of a collision between three molecules, A, B, and C, requires a slight modification. The probability that all three molecules are in contact simultaneously is extremely small. Therefore, a collision is considered to have occurred whenever the centers of all three molecules are within a distance \\(l\\) of each other. The resulting expression for the reactive three-body collision frequency, \\(Z_{ABC}\\), is given in Equation F.13.\n\\[\nZ_{AA}=\\left(N_A^*\\right)\\sigma _{AA}\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\epsilon_0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.12}\\]\n\\[\nZ_{ABC}=8N_A^*N_B^*N_C^*\\sigma _{AB}\\sigma _{BC}l\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi}}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_{AB}} -\\frac{1}{\\mu_{BC}} \\right)\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\epsilon_0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.13}\\]\nTo this point, all the equations have been developed on the basis of molecules. Through the use of Avogadro’s number, \\(N_{Av}\\), each quantity appearing in the equations above can be converted to molar units.\n\\[\n\\epsilon_0 = \\frac{E}{N_{Av}}\n\\]\n\\[\nk_B = \\frac{R}{N_{Av}}\n\\]\n\\[\nN_i^*= N_{Av}C_i\n\\]\n\\[\nZ_{AB}= N_{Av}r_{j,f}\n\\]\nSubstituting into Equations F.11, F.12 and F.13 gives Equations F.14, F.15 and F.16 for the generalized forward rates of bimolecular A-B reactions, bimolecular A-A reactions, and termolecular A-B-C reactions, respectively. It should be noted that these expressions only give the rate of the reaction in the forward direction, as indicated by the \\(f\\) appended to the subscript on the rate, \\(r\\).\n\\[\nr_{AB,f}=N_{Av}\\sigma _{AB}C_AC_B\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.14}\\]\n\\[\nr_{AA,f}=N_{Av}\\sigma _{AA}C_A^2\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.15}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_{ABC,f} &= 8N_{Av}\\sigma _{AB}\\sigma _{BC}IC_AC_BC_C\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi}} \\\\\n& \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_{AB}} -\\frac{1}{\\mu_{BC}} \\right)\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{F.16}\\]\nReal molecules are not spheres. For an asymmetrical molecule, it may be necessary for the collision to take place in one part of the molecule in order to have reaction take place. If the colliding molecules are not oriented properly, necessary bonds can’t form and reaction can’t occur. The collision theory does not account for this kind of steric (geometric) limitation. If a reaction does have steric limitations, a constant is introduced into the rate expressions above. This constant, called a steric factor, is equal to the fraction of the collisions that have the orientation necessary for reaction to take place.\nIf the constants in the rate expressions above are unknown, they can be treated as adjustable parameters that are used to fit the rate expression to experimental data. In order to do so, groups of constants in the expressions above must be lumped together into single constants. Doing results in a single collision theory rate expression for the forward rate of an elementary reaction, Equation F.17, irrespective of whether it is a bimolecular A-B reaction, a bimolecular A-A reaction or a termolecular A-B-C reaction. Note that the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants in that equation, \\(\\nu_{i,j}\\), are negative numbers so the resulting exponents on the concentrations are positive.\n\\[\nr_{j,f} = k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_u,j}}\n\\tag{F.17}\\]\nGenerally the net rate of reaction is more useful than the rate in the forward direction only. It is straightforward to generate an expression for the net rate of reaction. The definition of forward and reverse is completely arbitrary, so Equation F.17 can be used to generate an expression for the rate in the reverse direction, too.\n\\[\nr_{j,r} = k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\tag{F.18}\\]\nWhen the reaction reaches thermodynamic equilibrium, its net rate will equal zero, and as a consequence, the rate in the forward direction will equal the rate in the reverse direction. Thus, the two uni-directional rates can be set equal to each other while simultaneously recognizing that this is true only when the concentrations are equal to the equilibrium concentrations. Rearrangement of the resulting equation reveals that the ratio of the forward to the reverse rate coefficients must equal the concentration equilibrium constant for the elementary reaction, Equation F.19.\n\\[\nr_{j,f}\\Bigr\\rvert_\\text{equilibrium} = r_{j,r}\\Bigr\\rvert_\\text{equilibrium}\n\\]\n\\[\nk_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}} =k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p,eq}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}}{k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}} = \\prod_i C_{i,eq}^{\\nu_{i,j}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}}{k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}} = K_{j,eq_c}\n\\tag{F.19}\\]\nAn expression for the net rate of reaction according to collision theory is found by taking the difference between the forward and reverse rates. This can be written using the reverse rate coefficient, as in Equation F.20 or using the equilibrium constant, as in Equation F.21. The two forms are equivalent.\n\\[\nr_j = r_{j,f} - r_{j,r}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}} \\\\&- k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{F.20}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\left(\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\displaystyle \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,j}}}{K_{j,eq_c}}\\right)\n\\tag{F.21}\\]\nIt is often convenient to use partial pressures as the composition variables in a gas phase reaction system. Equations F.20 and F.21 can be easily converted so that partial pressures replace the concentrations. Since Equations F.20 and F.21 were derived assuming ideal gas type behavior, the concentrations and partial pressures are simply related via the ideal gas law, Equation F.22. Substitution of Equation F.22 into Equation F.20 or F.21 leads, in a straightforward manner, to a rate expression in terms of partial pressures instead of concentrations.\n\\[\nC_i=\\frac{n_i}{V}=\\frac{P_i}{RT}\n\\tag{F.22}\\]",

    "text": "F.4 Limitations of Collision Theory\nCollision theory as presented here is sometimes referred to as simple collision theory. It offers a simple molecular view of how reactions take place, and it can be useful for making rough approximations of the values of pre-exponential factors. There are several shortcomings of simple collision theory. First, the point-mass assumption is very limiting; it ignores internal motions within molecules and the energy associated with those internal motions. A second shortcoming is the absence of attractive and repulsive forces between molecules. In a real system, a molecule that is passing close to a second molecule may be attracted by it, causing it to travel in a curved path and collide with that molecule instead of continuing past it on a straight line path. Another shortcoming is the absence of orientation requirements for reaction to occur. Simple collision theory does not offer an easy way to estimate the activation energy, and it strictly applies only to gas phase reactions. There are also reactions for which the observed rate is higher than that predicted by the collision theory, and this can’t be explained by steric effects because they should lower the reaction rate, not raise it. There are more advanced formulations of collision theory that address the shortcomings enumerated here. Since these advanced formulations use more accurate representations of the molecules, they are often referred to as molecular reaction dynamics models.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "G.1 Potential Energy Surface for a Reaction\nThere are several ways to develop the transition state theory. Some use classical thermodynamics and some use statistical mechanics. Here the theory will be developed in the context of the hypothetical reaction between an AB molecule and a C atom, Equation G.1.\n\\[\nAB + C \\rightarrow A + BC\n\\tag{G.1}\\]\nThere are three atoms involved in reaction G.1. Consider a system in space consisting of these three atoms. Each of the atoms may be located anywhere within the system. The arrangement of these three atoms in space can be specified using nine coordinates, namely the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) coordinates of each atom’s center. Quantum chemistry could be used to calculate the energy, \\(\\Phi\\), of the system for all possible combinations of these nine coordinates. The energy could then be plotted as a function of the nine coordinates yielding a ten-dimensional potential energy surface.\nMost people can’t visualize a ten dimensional surface. Therefore consider an approximate three dimensional system where the centers of mass of all three atoms are constrained to lie on a common straight line, where the C atom is fixed at the origin, and where the C atom is not between the other two atoms. As shown in Figure G.1, the geometry of this simplified system can be completely defined by two coordinates: the distance between the centers of the A and B atoms, \\(D_{AB}\\), and the distance between the centers of the B and C atoms, \\(D_{BC}\\). The energy for this simplified system can be represented as a three-dimensional surface.\nFigure G.2 is an example of how this potential energy surface might appear. It can be seen that there are valleys or wells on the surface. (The same would be true of the ten-dimensional potential surface originally considered.) Wells that are relatively deep represent geometric arrangements where stable compounds have formed. Figure G.2 indicates two such wells. For one well in Figure G.2 the \\(D_{AB}\\) distance is small and constant whereas the \\(D_{BC}\\) distance can take on any large value. This well corresponds to the existence of an AB molecule and a separate C atom. The other well in Figure G.2 corresponds to the existence of a BC molecule and a separate A atom; \\(D_{BC}\\) is small and constant (equal to the bond length), and \\(D_{AB}\\) can take on any large value.\nFigure G.2 also shows a path (a-b-c-d-e) between the two potential wells. This path crosses over the smallest barrier separating the two wells. For the reaction as written in Equation G.1, the starting point, a, is the well corresponding to an AB molecule and a separate C atom. Assume the reaction takes place with the three atoms constrained to remain collinear, with the C atom fixed at the origin, and with the C atom not between the other two atoms. Then as the reaction takes place the system traces out the path a-b-c-d-e shown in Figure G.2. The difference in energy between the bottom of the well where the system started (point a) and the highest point on the path (point c) is the activation energy for the reaction. Notice that as the system passes over the barrier, \\(D_{AB}\\) increases (the AB bond breaks) and \\(D_{BC}\\) begins to approach the normal BC bond length.\nThus, if it is assumed that the lowest energy path is followed, the potential surface can be used to determine that path. Each point on the path completely specifies the orientation of the entire system. Once this path has been determined, the potential energy diagram can be reduced from however many dimensions it originally had to a two dimensional plot. The abscissa of the plot is the distance along the path that has been determined from the full potential surface, and the ordinate is the potential energy of the system at that distance along the path. The distance along the identified path is often referred to as the reaction coordinate. Figure G.3 shows this kind of two-dimensional potential energy diagram. The diagram in Figure G.3 corresponds to Figure G.2; the points a through e on the two diagrams also correspond.\nThe state of the system when it is at the highest point in Figure G.3 is known as the transition state. Recall that each point on the path corresponds to a specific arrangement of the atoms. At the top of the activation barrier (i. e. in the transition state) all the atoms are in close proximity. The distances \\(D_{AB}\\) and \\(D_{BC}\\) are different than they would be in either stable molecule. The species formed from the three atoms when they are in the orientation corresponding to the transition state is called the activated complex. The activated complex is neither reactants nor products; it is a hybrid of the two. To recap, the entity at the top of the activation barrier is called the activated complex and it is said to be in the transition state.\nThe activated complex is not a stable chemical species. It is a species in transition, and its lifetime is exceedingly short. Nonetheless, in transition state theory, it is assumed that the activated complex can be treated like a stable chemical species. Specifically, it is assumed that the activated complex can be assigned thermodynamic properties like any stable species. These thermodynamic properties can be estimated using the same techniques that are used to estimate the thermodynamic properties of stable species.\nThe most important assumption of transition state theory is that the reactants are in a special kind of equilibrium with those activated complexes that are in the process of transforming from reactants into products. (The reactants are only in equilibrium with those activated complexes that are in the process of becoming products and not with those that are in the process of becoming reactants.) One consequence of this is that the theory will only apply when the reactant molecules are present in a Boltzmann distribution. If the reaction process is so fast that the distribution of reactant molecules deviates from the Boltzmann distribution, the transition state theory cannot be used. Fortunately this situation is infrequently encountered.\nThe rationale for assuming that “forward moving” activated complexes are in equilibrium with the reactants begins by considering the situation where the chemical reaction has reached thermodynamic equilibrium. At this point the net rate of reaction equals zero, but there is still a significant absolute rate in the forward direction and an equal absolute rate in the reverse direction. Thus, at overall equilibrium the reactants are in equilibrium with the forward moving activated complexes, the products are in equilibrium with the “backward moving” activated complexes, and the number of forward moving activated complexes must just equal the number of backward moving activated complexes. Now suppose that by some unspecified means, all product molecules are instantaneously removed, and thereby the overall reaction is no longer at equilibrium. Since the products have all been removed, the absolute rate in the reverse direction will be zero, but there is no reason why the number of forward moving activated complexes should change. This thought experiment justifies the assumption that the reactants are always in a special kind of equilibrium with those activated complexes which are in the process of becoming products. If this was not true, then the rate coefficient would change as the reaction approached equilibrium. Such a change in the rate coefficient has not been observed experimentally.\nReturning to Figure G.3, the absolute rate of reaction in the forward direction is seen to be equal to the number of times activated complexes pass over the potential barrier from the reactant well to the product well. This, in turn, depends upon two factors: how many forward-moving activated complexes are present at a given time, and how fast do they proceed along the reaction coordinate. The first factor is determined using the assumptions just described. It is assumed that the reactants are in equilibrium with those activated complexes in the process of moving across the potential barrier in the forward direction. For the reaction as written in Equation G.2, this can be expressed using an equilibrium constant as shown in equation Equation G.3. The latter equation can be rearranged to give an expression for the concentration of the activated complexes, Equation G.4. In Equations G.3 and G.4 \\(C_i\\) denotes molar concentration of \\(i\\), \\(K^\\ddagger\\) is a concentration-based equilibrium constant for reaction G.2, and the superscripted symbol, \\(\\ddagger\\), is used to denote that a given quantity is associated with a forward moving activated complex which is proceeding along the reaction coordinate.\n\\[\nAB + C \\rightleftarrows ABC^\\ddagger\n\\tag{G.2}\\]\n\\[\nK^\\ddagger = \\frac{C_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}}{C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}}\n\\tag{G.3}\\]\n\\[\nC_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = K^\\ddagger C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\n\\tag{G.4}\\]\nEquation G.4 gives the number of moles of activated complexes in a unit volume. All that remains is to determine how rapidly each of these complexes travels along the reaction coordinate. In principle it would be possible to determine how rapidly the activated complex moves along the reaction coordinate using the original Cartesian coordinate system. Thus, progress along the reaction coordinate could be expressed in terms of the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) components of velocity of each of the three atoms in the activated complex. This would be very cumbersome because motion along the reaction coordinate involves simultaneous changes of all nine of the coordinates.\nIt is easier (and customary) to use a different set of coordinates to describe the motion along the reaction coordinate. This does not change the potential surface in any way, it just changes the ease with which motion upon it can be described. (It is possible to describe a sphere using rectangular, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates. The sphere is the same in all three cases, but the equations describing it are much simpler if spherical coordinates are used). Motion of the atoms making up the \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) activated complex as it moves along the reaction coordinate can then be described in terms of the following nine coordinates. Three coordinates correspond translational motion of the center of mass of the activated complex as a whole; one coordinate in each of the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) directions. For non-linear activated complexes, three additional coordinates describe the rotational motion of the whole complex about axes parallel to the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) directions. (If the activated complex is linear, only two coordinates are used; one each to describe the rotational motion about the two axes perpendicular to the centerline of the complex itself.) The remaining coordinates correspond to different vibrations within the activated complex. In general, if there are \\(N\\) atoms making up the activated complex the total number of coordinates is \\(3N\\). At first it may seem that little has been gained by changing coordinate systems. However, it will be reasoned in what follows that as the activated complex approaches the top of the activation barrier, moving along the reaction coordinate becomes equivalent to changing just one vibrational mode. Hence the reaction coordinate becomes associated with a single coordinate of the system.\nConsider now the equilibrium constant, \\(K^\\ddagger\\), in Equation G.4. Since it has been assumed that the activated complex can be treated as a stable species, this equilibrium constant can be analyzed from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics. For an ideal gas the equilibrium constant in terms of molar concentrations is given by Equation G.5.\n\\[\nK^\\ddagger = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}}{q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}} \\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_0^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{G.5}\\]\nIn Equation G.5, \\(K^\\ddagger\\) is the equilibrium constant for reaction G.2 in terms of molar concentrations, \\(q_i\\) is the molecular partition function (omitting the electronic contribution) per unit volume for species \\(i\\), \\(-\\Delta E_0^0\\) is the change in ground state electronic energy of the system when reaction G.2 takes place stoichiometrically at the absolute zero of temperature, \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant, \\(T\\) is the temperature, and a superscripted \\(\\ddagger\\) is used to denote that a particular quantity involves a forward moving activated complex. (Note: Equation G.5 assumes that essentially all species are in their electronic ground state during reaction.)\nAccording to statistical mechanics, the energy available to a system is distributed, or partitioned, among the different possible states of the system. The partition function, \\(q_i\\), is a measure of the availability of these states per unit volume. The partition function is made up of component terms for each different type of state available to the system, e. g. as given in Equation G.6, where \\(q_{tr,i}\\) is the partition function for the translational states of species \\(i\\), \\(q_{rot,i}\\) is the rotational partition function and \\(q_{vib,i}\\) is the vibrational partition function.\n\\[\nq_i = q_{tr,i}q_{rot,i}q_{vib,i}\n\\tag{G.6}\\]\nEach type of state may have more than one degree of freedom. For example, if \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) is a linear complex it will have three degrees of translational freedom, two degrees of rotational freedom, and four degrees of vibrational freedom. The partition functions for a certain type of motion can be broken down into terms for each of the available degrees of freedom. If \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) is a linear complex, then its vibrational partition function can be broken into four component terms as indicated in Equation G.7. In Equation G.7 the terms \\(q_{v_1,i}\\), \\(q_{v_2,i}\\), \\(q_{v_3,i}\\), and \\(q_{v_4,i}\\) are vibrational partition functions for each of the (in this case, four) vibrational degree of freedom of species \\(i\\). Equation G.8 is used to calculate the value of the partition function for any one particular vibrational degree of freedom of species \\(i\\). In Equation G.8 \\(\\nu _n\\) is the characteristic vibrational frequency associated with the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) degree of vibrational freedom and \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant.\n\\[\nq_{vib,i}=q_{n_{v_1},i}q_{n_{v_2},i}q_{n_{v_3},i}q_{n_{v_4},i}\n\\tag{G.7}\\]\n\\[\nq_{n_v,i} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-h\\nu_{n_v}}{k_BT} \\right)}}\n\\tag{G.8}\\]\nUsing Equations G.6, G.7 and G.8 the partition function for the activated complex can be expanded as in Equation G.9, where \\(N_{vib}\\) is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for the \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) activated complex.\n\\[\nq_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = q_{tr,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}q_{rot,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\left(\\prod_{n_v}  q_{v_n,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\right)\n\\tag{G.9}\\]\nIn an activated complex there are bonds which are in the process of breaking and/or forming. One way to view such a process is as a stretching/compressing vibration along the bond(s) in question. Referring back to Figure G.1, one can imagine a kind of vibration where the central B atom moves back and forth horizontally while A and C remain relatively motionless. Clearly, at one end of this particular vibrational mode, the system would look more like AB + C, while at the other end of this mode it would look like A + BC. In other words, one half-cycle of this asymmetric stretching mode can easily be visualized as leading to the formation of a BC bond and the breaking of an AB bond. With this view, motion along the reaction coordinate in the vicinity of the transition state becomes equivalent to this one vibration. For present purposes this vibrational mode will be called the critical mode and its frequency will be denoted as \\(\\nu _c\\).\nSince the bond(s) in question are not completely formed and/or broken in the activated complex, they are expected to be quite weak. The vibrational frequency of a weak bond is low, and this allows the partition function of this one vibrational mode to be approximated using Equation G.10. The partition function for this one weak bond can then be factored out of the total partition function for the \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) activated complex, Equation G.9, resulting in Equation G.11.\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\lim_{\\nu_c\\to 0} \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-h\\nu_c}{k_BT} \\right)}} = \\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}\n\\tag{G.10}\\]\n\\[\nq_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = q_{tr,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}q_{rot,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\left(\\prod_{n_v^\\prime}  q_{{n_v^\\prime},\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\right)\\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}\n\\tag{G.11}\\]\nNotice particularly that the continuous product in Equation G.11 excludes the partition function that was factored out. In addition, the approximation given in Equation G.10 has been used for the partition function of the critical vibration. The part of the total partition function which remains after factoring out the term for the critical vibration is often denoted by the symbol \\(q_{\\ddagger}\\), where the subscripted \\(\\ddagger\\) denotes that one term has been factored out. This notation is formalized in Equation G.12.\n\\[\nq_{\\ddagger} = \\frac{q_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}}{\\left(\\frac{-h\\nu_c}{k_BT}\\right)}=q_{tr,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}q_{rot,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\left(\\prod_{n_v^\\prime}  q_{{n_v^\\prime},\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\right)\n\\tag{G.12}\\]\nRearranging Equation G.12 gives Equation G.13, which can be substituted into Equation G.5 giving Equation G.14. After rearrangement, an expression for the critical vibrational frequency results, Equation G.15.\n\\[\nq_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = q_{\\ddagger}\\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}\n\\tag{G.13}\\]\n\\[\nK^\\ddagger = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}\\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}}{q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}} \\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_0^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{G.14}\\]\n\\[\n\\nu_c = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{K^\\ddagger q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_0^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{G.15}\\]\nThe final assumption needed to complete the analysis is that the frequency of the critical vibration will in fact equal the frequency at which the activated complexes are transformed into products. The assumption is that the first time the activated complex attempts to go through the asymmetric stretching vibration just described, the AB bond will break and the BC bond will form. As mentioned previously, the rate of the elementary reaction G.2 will be equal to the product of the concentration of forward-moving activated complexes and the frequency at which they decompose. This is expressed in Equation G.16, which makes use of this final assumption.\n\\[\nr_{j,f}=C_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} \\nu_c\n\\tag{G.16}\\]\nEquations G.4 and G.15 give expressions for the two terms on the right-hand side of Equation G.16. These can be substituted into Equation G.16 leading to Equation G.17 for the forward rate of the elementary reaction G.1. Equation G.17 has the form shown in Equation G.18, where the rate coefficient is given by Equation G.19 and the pre-exponential by Equation G.20. In contrast to the Arrhenius equation, the transition state theory pre-exponential factor is not constant. Temperature appears explicitly as well as in the total partition functions.\n\\[\nr_{j,f}= \\left(K^\\ddagger C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\\right)\\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{K^\\ddagger q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{j,f}= \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{ q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\n\\tag{G.17}\\]\n\\[\nr_{j,f}=k_{j,f}C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\n\\tag{G.18}\\]\n\\[\nk_{j,f} = k_{0,j,f}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{G.19}\\]\n\\[\nk_{0,j,f} = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{ q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\n\\tag{G.20}\\]\nAn analogous process can be used to generate an expression for the rate in the reverse direction, Equation G.21. The net rate of reaction then is simply the difference between the forward and reverse rates, Equation G.22. That expression can be generalized to other stoichiometries as shown in Equation G.23.\n\\[\nr_{j,r}= k_{0,j,r}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,r}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{A}}C_{\\text{BC}}\n\\tag{G.21}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_{0,j,f}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}} - k_{0,j,r}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,r}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{A}}C_{\\text{BC}}\n\\tag{G.22}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_{j,f}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}} - k_{j,r}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\tag{G.23}\\]\nAppendix F showed that the forward and reverse rate coefficients are related to the equilibrium constant, and that as a consequence, the net rate can be written in terms of the forward rate coefficient and the equilibrium constant. That appendix also showed how the ideal gas constant can be used to write the net rate expression in terms of partial pressures instead of concentrations. Both of those things apply to the net rate expression from transition state theory.",

    "text": "G.2 Shortcomings of Simple Transition State Theory\nThis simple formulation of transition state theory does have some shortcomings. It ignores the possibility of quantum mechanical tunneling through the barrier. Tunneling does not affect the rate coefficient for the vast majority of chemical reactions; it is most important when light elements are involved. A transmission coefficient can be added to account for tunneling in a manner similar to the way the steric factor accounts for orientation effects in simple collision theory.\nThe assumption that all modes remain in thermodynamic equilibrium is the source for another shortcoming. Reaction typically takes place within 10-12 s, and that is often not enough time for all modes of motion to reach equilibrium; the treatment given here ignores the dynamics of moving energy into the forming bond and into the leaving entity.\nA third shortcoming of simple transition state theory is that it assumes all reaction events pass through the saddle point. That is, it assumes the reaction coordinate for every reaction event passes over the lowest barrier separating the two wells in Figure G.2. Experimental and computational studies indicate that many times, the reacting molecules follow a reaction coordinate that passes over the barrier at a location other than the saddle point.",

    "text": "H.4 PFR Mole and Energy Balances\nThe PFR model makes the following assumptions.\n\nThe reactor is a cylinder with fluid continuously flowing in one end and out the other.\nThe fluid velocity does not vary across the diameter of the reactor; i. e. there is plug flow.\n\nHeat and mass are perfectly mixed across the radius.\nHeat and mass do not mix at all along the axis.\n\nIf there is a packed bed of catalyst particles within the reactor it is assumed that\n\nthere are no concentration gradients and no temperature gradients within the fluid near the external surfaces of the catalyst particles,\nthere are no concentration gradients and no temperature gradients within the fluid that is in the pores inside the catalyst particles, and consequently,\nthe reactor volume can be treated as a single phase (the so-called pseudo homogeneous model) by properly re-normalizing the rate of reaction.\n\n\nDuring the derivation of the forms of the PFR mole and energy balances used in Reaction Engineering Basics, the following additional assumptions are made.\n\nThe reactor diameter is constant.\nKinetic energy terms and gravitational potential energy terms are negligible.\nReaction rates are normalized per fluid volume.\nExchange of energy with the surroundings takes the form of heat that is transferred through the wall of the reactor.\nMechanical work is not performed on or by the system.\nThe fluid mixture is ideal.\n\nBoth \\(\\Delta H\\) and \\(\\Delta V\\) of mixing are zero.\n\nNo phase changes occur within or upon entering the system.\n\nUnlike the perfectly mixed stirred tank reactors, the composition in an ideal PFR is not uniform; it changes along the length of the reactor. As a consequence, it becomes necessary to write the mole and energy balance equations on a differential element of reactor volume and then take the limit as the size of this element goes to zero. With the assumption of perfect mixing in the radial direction, in the limit where its thickness goes to zero, the volume element is perfectly mixed. Here, we will assume that the reactor is cylindrical with a constant diameter, D, and a length, L, as shown in Figure H.1 which additionally shows a differentially thick cross section that will be used in formulating the mole and energy balances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure H.1: Differential PFR Element\n\n\n\n\nH.4.1 The PFR Mole Balance\nThe system being modeled is the fluid within the differential volume element of axial thickness, \\(dz\\), and diameter, \\(D\\), at any instant in time. The derivation begins with a general balance equation written for the moles of any one species, \\(i\\), present in the system.\n\\[\\text{Input Rate} + \\text{Generation Rate} = \\text{Output Rate} + \\text{Accumulation Rate}\\]\nAs with the CSTR, the Input Rate and Output Rate terms are simply equal to the molar flow rates at \\(z\\) and \\(z + dz\\), respectively.\n\\[\\text{Input Rate} = \\dot n_i \\biggr\\rvert_z\\]\n\\[\\text{Output Rate} = \\dot n_i \\biggr\\rvert_{z+dz}\\]\nWith the assumption that the rates are normalized per fluid volume, the rate of generation of species \\(i\\) via reaction \\(j\\) is the volume of the fluid element, \\(\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz\\), times the rate of generation of \\(i\\) per fluid volume, \\(\\nu_{i,j}r_j\\). The Generation Rate term then is the sum over all reactions.\n\\[\\text{Generation Rate} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\\]\nThe Accumulation Rate is the instantaneous time-derivative of the number of moles in the differential element. The number of moles equals the volume of the differential element times the concentration of the species. In a flow system, the concentration is the ratio of the molar flow rate to the volumetric flow rate.\n\\[\\text{Accumulation Rate} = \\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{\\dot n_i \\big\\rvert_z}{\\dot V} \\right)\\]\nSubstitution into the general balance equation yields a mole balance expressed in terms of the differential thickness of the fluid element.\n\\[\\dot n_i \\biggr\\rvert_z + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j = \\dot n_i \\biggr\\rvert_{z+dz} + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}dz \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{\\dot n_i \\big\\rvert_z}{\\dot V} \\right)\\]\nThat equation can be rearranged and divided by \\(dz\\).\n\\[\\frac{\\dot n_i \\biggr\\rvert_{z+dz} - \\dot n_i \\biggr\\rvert_z}{dz}=\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{\\dot n_i \\big\\rvert_z}{\\dot V} \\right)\\]\nTaking the limit as \\(dz\\) approaches zero yields the mole balance in the form of a partial differential equation.\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\dot n_i}{\\partial z}=\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left( \\frac{\\dot n_i \\big\\rvert_z}{\\dot V} \\right)\\]\nApplying the chain rule and moving all of the derivatives to one side of the equation leads to the desired form of the PFR mole balance.\n\\[\\frac{\\partial \\dot n_i}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\frac{\\partial\\dot n_i}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\pi D^2\\dot n_i}{4\\dot V^2} \\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial t}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\]\n\n\nH.4.2 The PFR Energy Balance\nThe PFR energy balance begins with a general balance on the same fluid element, Figure H.1, as was used for the PFR mole balance only written for energy at any one instant of time during the operation of the reactor.\n\\[\\text{Input Rate} + \\text{Generation Rate} = \\text{Output Rate} + \\text{Accumulation Rate}\\]\nAs was the case for the SBSTR and CSTR, the Input Rate term includes internal energy carried into the volume by the fluid, flow work done by the fluid on the volume element and heat transfer through the wall of the differential element. It is assumed that the heat transfer coefficient, \\(U\\), is constant.\n\\[\\text{Input Rate} = \\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat u_i  \\right) \\biggr\\rvert_z + \\left(  P\\dot V \\right)\\biggr\\rvert_z + \\pi D U\\left( T_e - T  \\right)dz\\]\nThe Output Rate term is also like that for the CSTR except that there is no shaft work for a PFR.\n\\[\\text{Output Rate} = \\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat u_i  \\right) \\biggr\\rvert_{z+dz} + \\left(  P\\dot V \\right)\\biggr\\rvert_{z+dz}\\]\nAs with all of the reactors, the Generation Rate is zero.\n\\[\\text{Generation Rate} = 0\\]\nThe Rate of Accumulation term is like that for the CSTR except that the volume is the volume of the differential element. Also, because there are quantities that vary with both axial position and time, the derivative is a partial derivative.\n\\[\\text{Accumulation Rate} = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(  \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\left(  \\frac{\\dot n_i \\hat u_i}{\\dot V} \\right)dz \\right)\\]\nThe Input Rate, Generation Rate, Output Rate and Accumulation Rate terms can be substituted into the general balance equation.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat u_i  \\right) \\biggr\\rvert_z + \\left(  P\\dot V \\right)\\biggr\\rvert_z + \\pi D U\\left( T_e -

To do so, rearrange the ATE so that there is a zero on one side of the equation. The residual is equal to the non-zero side of the resulting equation. A residual can be defined for each ATE in the set to be solved. Note that in general each residual is a function of all of the unknowns. A guess for a solution of the ATEs can be tested by using the guess to calculate the residuals. If all of the residuals equal zero, the guess is a solution of the ATEs.\nA computer function, here called a residuals function, can be written and used to test guesses in that way. The residuals function receives as an argument, a guess for the solution. Within the residuals function, the guess is used to calculate the residual corresponding to each of the ATEs, and the resulting values are returned. Often the guesses are passed to the residuals function as a vector and the corresponding residuals are returned as a vector.",

    "text": "I.3 ATE Solvers\nTypically, an ATE solver must be provided with two inputs. The first is an initial guess for the unknowns. The second is a residuals function, as defined above. The manner in which these inputs are provided to the solver depends upon the specific solver being used.\nEffectively, an ATE solver finds the solution of a set of ATEs by trial and error.\n\nIt tests the initial guess by calling the residuals function and determining whether all of the residuals equal zero.\nIf the initial guess is not a solution of the ATEs, the ATE solver generates an improved guess and tests that.\n\nThe improved guess will not be an exact solution (unless the ATEs are linear equations), but usually it will be closer to the solution than the previous guess.\n\nThe ATE solver keeps generating improved guesses and testing them until no further improvement is possible.\nIt then returns the final, most-improved guess as the best solution of the ATEs.\n\nSo, the numerical solution of a set of ATEs is an iterative process, and ideally, the residuals should get closer and closer to zero with each iteration. This is called convergence to a solution. Typically, the solution returned by the solver will not be exact, but it will be “very close” to the exact solution. Put differently, when a converged solution is found, the difference between the solution returned by the solver and the exact solution is negligible.\n\nI.3.1 Solver Issues\nSometimes the solver is unable to converge to the point where the residuals are “very close” to zero. In this situation, the solver eventually has to quit without finding a converged solution. Typically it will print an error message or return a flag variable, and that variable will indicate whether or not a converged solution was obtained.\nWhen the ATE solver is not able to converge to a solution, it is often because the guess provided to the solver wasn’t close enough to the solution or because of a singularity in one or more of the residuals. For example, fractions that contain one or more unknowns in the denominator may appear in the residuals. If a guess for the solution causes such a denominator to equal zero, the residual becomes infinite.\nPotential singularities can be removed by re-defining the residuals. To do so, first rearrange each ATE so there is a zero on one side of the equation. Then multiply through the equation by each denominator that contains an unknown. Finally, use the resulting non-zero side of the equation as the residual. If possible, a better initial guess should be defined, and the solver should be called again.\nAdditionally, sets of nonlinear equations can have more than one solution. For example, a quadratic polynomial has two solutions. If a set of ATEs has multiple solutions, most ATE solvers will only find one of them. To find other solutions, the solver should be re-started using a different initial guess.",

I will, however, rewrite them as residuals since I know I’ll need them in that form when I solve them numerically\n\n\n\nReactor Design EQuations\nRewriting equations (1), (2), and (3), as residuals expressions yields equations (4), (5), and (6). They will be solved to find the values of \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{A,in} -  \\dot n_A - Vr = \\epsilon_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{Z,in} - \\dot n_Z + Vr = \\epsilon_2 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\breve{C}_p \\dot{V}\\left(  T - T_{in} \\right) + Vr\\Delta H = \\epsilon_3 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the ATEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the residuals for each guess and provide an initial guess.\nStarting with evaluating the residuals, I’ll need to evaluate them each time a new guess for the solution is generated. At that point, guesses for each of the unknowns will be available along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the residuals expressions.\nIn this example, the only other quantity that appears in any of the ATEs is \\(r\\), so I will write an expression for \\(r\\) in terms of the known constants and the unknowns. (As mentioned in the problem statement, it is assumed here that the engineer knows the rate expression used in equation (7) below.)\nWriting the ancillary equation for \\(r\\) introduces \\(C_A\\), and \\(C_A\\) is neither a known constant nor one of the unknowns, so an expression is needed for \\(C_A\\), too. In this case, the defining equation for concentration in a closed system can be used.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Residuals\n\\[\nr = k_0 \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)} C_A^2 \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{V}} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the ATEs numerically, I’ll also need to provide an initial guess for the solution. I’ll guess that half of the A reacts. That will result in an amount of Z equal to half of the original amount of A. I don’t have any idea how large the temperature change will be, but having some knowledge of the CSTR design equations, I can see that this reactor is adiabatic and the reaction is endothermic. That means that the temperature will decrease. I’ll gues the temperature change is small, 10 K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactor models can be very sensitive to temperature due to the exponential term. For this reason it is prudent when guessing a temperature to guess a value that is close to a known temperature in the system, such as \\(T_{in}\\) in this example. If the guess is too large, the exponential term may become excessively large and prevent the solver from converging.\nIn this situation (an endothermic reaction in an adiabatic CSTR) the engineer would not expect multiple solutions to be possible. If the engineer knew that multiple solutions were possible, the solution would be repeated using different initial guesses to find additional solutions.\n\n\n\n\nCalculations Summary\n\nSubstitute the known constants into all equations.\nWhen it is necessary to evaluate the residuals\n\nCalculate \\(C_A\\) using equation (8),\nCalculate \\(r\\) using equation (7), and\nCalculate \\(\\epsilon_1\\), \\(\\epsilon_2\\), and \\(\\epsilon_3\\) using equations (4), (5), and (6).\n\n\n\n\nI.6.3 Numerical Implementation of the Solution\n\nMake the given and known constants available for use in all functions.\nWrite a residuals function that\n\nreceives guess values for \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\),\nevaluates the residuals as described in step 2 of the calculations summary, and\nreturns the values of the residuals.\n\nWrite a reactor model function that\n\ndefines an initial guess for the unknowns, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\),\ngets a set of values of the unknowns that solve the ATEs by calling an ATE solver and passing the following information to it\n\nthe initial guess and\nthe name of the residuals function from step 2 above, d, checks that the solver converged, and\n\nreturns the values returned by the ATE solver.\n\nPerform the analysis by\n\ngetting \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), and \\(T\\), by calling the reactor model function from step 3 above,\ndisplaying and saving the results, as desired.\n\n\n\n\nI.6.4 Results and Discussion\nThe calculations were performed as described above and it was found that \\(\\dot{n}_A\\) = 157 mol/h, \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\) = 343 mol/h, and \\(T\\) = 128 °C.\nNote that the solution is not exact, but the error is negligibly small. That is, if the solution is used to calculate the residuals using equations (4) through (6), the values are not exactly zero, but instead (with the software used here), \\(\\epsilon_1\\) = -4.32 x 10-10, \\(\\epsilon_2\\) = 4.32 x 10-10, \\(\\epsilon_3\\) = 7.87 x 10-6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE",

    "text": "J.1 Identifying IVODEs\nA differential equation contains at least one derivative. A distinguishing feature of a set of ordinary differential equations is that every derivative that appears in the equations has the same independent variable. Put differently, there are no partial derivatives in a set of ordinary differential equations. In virtually all cases, the sets of IVODEs that are solved in Reaction Engineering Basics are linear, first-order ODEs. That means that there are no higher order derivatives in the equations and that there are no products, quotients or powers of the first-order derivatives.\nThus, the sets of IVODEs under consideration here will take the form shown in Equations J.1 through J.4. In those equations \\(x\\) is the independent variable; \\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), \\(y_3\\), and \\(y_4\\) are the dependent variables; and \\(m_{1,1}\\) through \\(m_{4,4}\\) and \\(g_1\\) through \\(g_4\\) can be constants or functions of the independent and dependent variables.\n\\[\nm_{1,1}\\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{1,2}\\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{1,3}\\frac{dy_3}{dx} + m_{1,4}\\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_1\n\\tag{J.1}\\]\n\\[\nm_{2,1}\\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{2,2}\\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{2,3}\\frac{dy_3}{dx} + m_{2,4}\\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_2\n\\tag{J.2}\\]\n\\[\nm_{3,1}\\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{3,2}\\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{3,3}\\frac{dy_3}{dx} + m_{3,4}\\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_3\n\\tag{J.3}\\]\n\\[\nm_{4,1}\\frac{dy_1}{dx} + m_{4,2}\\frac{dy_2}{dx} + m_{4,3}\\frac{dy_3}{dx}  + m_{4,4}\\frac{dy_4}{dx} = g_4\n\\tag{J.4}\\]\nWhile four equations are being used here for illustration purposes, there can be any number of ordinary differential equations in the set as long as the number of ordinary differential equations is equal to the number of dependent variables, and there is only one independent variable.

    "section": "J.2 IVODE Solvers",
    "text": "J.2 IVODE Solvers\nThe inner workings of IVODE solvers are beyond the scope of Reaction Engineering Basics. Nonetheless, a simplified understanding of how IVODEs are solved numerically is useful. When an IVODE solver is called, it must be provided with the following arguments: the initial values, the stopping criterion (i. e. the final value of either the independent variable or one of the dependent variables), and a derivatives function. As described below, the derivatives function uses the IVODEs to calculate and return the values of the derivatives appearing in the IVODEs.\nThe solver starts from the initial values, as illustrated graphically in part (a) of Figure J.1 for any one of the dependent variables. It isn’t possible to plot \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) at that point because \\(y\\left(x\\right)\\) is not known. (Indeed, \\(y\\left(x\\right)\\) is the solution to the IVODE.) Instead, the solver uses the IVODEs to calculate the value of each of the derivatives at \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\). The derivative, \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\), at that point is the slope of the unknown function at \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\). This is shown graphically in part (b) of Figure J.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure J.1: Graphical Representation of an IVODE Integration Step. (a) The initial value. (b) The slope at that point. (c) Incrementally increasing x and approximating the corresponding y.\n\n\n\nStarting from the known point, \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\), the solver increases \\(x\\) by a small amount, \\(\\Delta x\\), which is known as the step-size. It then calculates the corresponding change in \\(y\\), \\(\\Delta y\\), using the slope. The resulting point, \\(\\left(x_1,y_1\\right)\\), is shown in part (c) of Figure J.1. This process is sometimes referred to as taking an integration step. Effectively, the solver uses the small straight line segment between \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_1,y_1\\right)\\) to approximate the true solution, \\(y\\left(x\\right)\\), in that interval. The accuracy of this approximation increases as \\(\\Delta x\\) decreases, so typically the solver uses small steps. A new integration step is then taken starting fr0m \\(\\left(x_1,y_1\\right)\\).\nOf course, the solver eventually must stop taking integration steps. After completing each step, the solver checks to determine whether making that step resulted in the stopping criterion being satisfied. If not, the solver takes another integration step. As an example, suppose the stopping criterion is that \\(y_3\\) should equal some value, \\(y_{3,f}\\), the solver would check to see whether \\(y_3\\) did, in fact, reach or surpass \\(y_{3,f}\\) after making the step. In most cases the stopping criterion will have been surpassed by some small amount, in which case the solver interpolates to find final values that exactly satisfy the stopping criterion. It then returns the values of the dependent variables and the independent variable for all of the steps it took while solving the IVODEs, including those final interpolated values.\n\nJ.2.1 Cautions Related to Numerical Solution of IVODEs\nWhen the stopping criterion is a value of one of the dependent variables, many solvers require that you provide both a final value of the independent variable and the known final value of that dependent variable. The solver then takes steps as described above, and after each step it checks to see whether either variable has reached its specified final value. The problem is that if you specify a final value of the independent variable that is too small, the solver may reach that value first and stop. The stopping criterion you specified for the dependent variable will not have been reached, and the result that is returned is not the result you are seeking. Therefore it is important to check that the dependent variable reached the specified final value.\nTo avoid having the solver stop because it reached the stopping criterion for the independent variable, it is tempting to specify a very large final value for the independent variable stopping criterion. The problem with doing this is that it may cause the solver to use a step size that is too large, resulting in an inaccurate solution. Therefore, it is important to check that the step size was not too large. The solution that is returned will include the final value of the independent variable. The stopping criterion for the independent variable can be set to a value slightly larger than that and the equations can be solved a second time. Assuming the second solution reaches the desired stopping criterion for the dependent variable, the second solution should be accurate.\nA second possible problem arises when solving sets of IVODEs where one of the dependent variables changes very abruptly over a very small range of the independent variable. The abrupt changes in that dependent variable may significantly affect the other dependent variables over a much broader range of the independent variable. Equations like this are called stiff ODEs, and they require special treatment of the step size. Therefore, when solving sets of ODEs, one should pay attention to whether any of the dependent variables change very abruptly as the independent variable changes. If they do, it is advisable to repeat the solution using a solver that is specifically tailored to stiff ODEs.",

    "section": "J.3 Input Required by IVODE Solvers",
    "text": "J.3 Input Required by IVODE Solvers\nThe preceeding discussion shows that IVODE solvers need three things in order to solve a set of IVODEs. The first are the initial values from which the solver will take the first integration step. The second is the name of a function, written by the reaction engineer, that the solver can use to evaluate the derivatives, that is to calculate the numerical values of the derivatives. Herein, this function will be referred to as the derivatives function. The third required input to an IVODE solver is a stopping criterion that the solver can use to decide when to stop taking integration steps. As noted above, a stopping criterion has two parts: the identity of the variable (the independent variable or one of the dependent variables) and its final value.\n\nJ.3.1 Derivative Expressions and the Derivatives Function\nIt was noted above that one input required by an IVODE solver is the name of a function, written by the reaction engineer, that the solver can use to evaluate the derivatives. More specifically, the derivatives function must accept the independent variable and the dependent variables corresponding to the start of an integration step as input arguments, and it must use them to calculate and return the values of the derivatives that appear in the IVODEs.\nTo do so, it is useful to convert the IVODEs into a set of expressions for the individual derivatives if they aren’t already in that form. For example, Equations J.1 through J.4 need to be converted to derivative expressions of the form shown in Equations J.5 through J.8 where \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), \\(f_3\\), and \\(f_4\\) each may be a function of \\(x\\), \\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), \\(y_3\\), and \\(y_4\\).\n\\[\n\\frac{dy_1}{dx}  = f_1\n\\tag{J.5}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dy_2}{dx} = f_2\n\\tag{J.6}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dy_3}{dx} = f_3\n\\tag{J.7}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dy_4}{dx} = f_4\n\\tag{J.8}\\]\nThat can be accomplished by algebraic manipulation of Equations J.1 through J.4, but it is particularly straightforward if the original IVODEs are written as a matrix equation. The coefficients in Equations J.1 through J.4, \\(m_{1,1}\\), \\(m_{1,2}\\), etc., can be used to construct a so-called mass matrix, \\(\\boldsymbol{M}\\), as shown in Equation J.9, the dependent variables can be used to construct a column vector, \\(\\underline{y}\\), as in equation Equation J.10, and the functions, \\(g_1\\), \\(g_2\\), \\(g_3\\), and \\(g_4\\), can be used to construct a column vector, \\(\\underline{g}\\), as in equation Equation J.11.\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{M} = \\begin{bmatrix} m_{1,1} \\ m_{1,2} \\ m_{1,3} \\ m_{1,4} \\\\m_{2,1} \\ m_{2,2} \\ m_{2,3} \\ m_{2,4} \\\\m_{3,1} \\ m_{3,2} \\ m_{3,3} \\ m_{3,4} \\\\ m_{4,1} \\ m_{4,2} \\ m_{4,3} \\ m_{4,4}  \\end{bmatrix}\n\\tag{J.9}\\]\n\\[\n\\underline{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ y_3 \\\\ y_4 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\tag{J.10}\\]\n\\[\n\\underline{g} = \\begin{bmatrix} g_1 \\\\ g_2 \\\\ g_3 \\\\ g_4 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\tag{J.11}\\]\nEquations J.1 through J.4 then can be written as a matrix equation, Equation J.12. Pre-multiplying each side of Equation J.12 by the inverse of the mass matrix yields the desired derivative expressions, Equation J.13. That is, comparing Equation J.13 to Equations J.5 through J.8, it is apparent that they are equivalent with \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), \\(f_3\\), and \\(f_4\\) given by Equation J.14.\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{M}\\frac{d}{dx}\\underline{y} = \\underline{g}\n\\tag{J.12}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\underline{y} = \\boldsymbol{M}^{-1} \\underline{g}\n\\tag{J.13}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ f_3 \\\\ f_4 \\end{bmatrix} = \\underline{f} = \\boldsymbol{M}^{-1} \\underline{g}\n\\tag{J.14}\\]\nWring the IVODEs in the form of derivatives expressions, facilitates evaluating the derivatives. The derivatives function will be provided with the independent and dependent variables as arguments. They can be used, along with known constants provided as part of the assignment, to evaluate each of the \\(f\\) functions in Equations J.5 through J.8, or equivalently in Equation J.14.\nThe \\(f\\) functions may also contain other variables and possibly, an unknown constant. The other variables clearly must be calculated in order to evaluate the \\(f\\) functions. This is done using expressions for those other variables in terms of known constants and the independent and dependent variables.\nIf the \\(f\\) functions contain an unknown constant, that, too, must be calculated before the \\(f\\) functions can be evaluated. Here, saying it is unknown means that it cannot be calculated directly using the known constants given as part of the assignment. In the examples presented in Reaction Engineering Basics there will be at most one such unknown constant.\nWhen the IVODEs, or equivalently the \\(f\\) functions, contain an unknown constant, the assignment will provide two final values. One of the two final values is used to specify the stopping criterion. The other final value is used to calculate the unknown constant. Doing this is described below. The important point here is that the unknown constant must be calculated before calling the IVODE solver, and after doing so, its value must be made available to the derivatives function. If the unknown constant is also needed for calcuating initial values, it must be made available wherever the IVODE solver is called, too. (See Example J.6.3.)\nSo to summarize, if the IVODEs contain an unknown constant, its value must be calculated before calling the IVODE solver, and it must be made available within the derivatives function. Similarly, the known constants given as part of the assignment must also be available within the derivatives function. When the reaction engineer writes the derivatives function, it should receive the independent and dependent variables as arguments. It should first calculate the values of any variables other than the independent and dependent variables. Then it should evaluate the \\(f\\) functions using Equations J.5 through J.8, or equivalently, Equation J.14. Finally it should return the resulting values of the derivatives.\n\n\nJ.3.2 Initial Values and the Stopping Criterion\nThe initial and final values are constants. If their values are not given as part of the assignment, they must be calculated before the IVODEs can be solved. In most instances, if they are not provided as part of an assignment, they can be calculated using other constants that are given in the assignment. As an example, the assignment might give the volume of the reacting fluid and initial concentrations of reagents from which the initial molar amounts can be calculated.\nThere might be one initial value that cannot be calculated directly using the constants provided in the assignment. This situation is same as that described above when an unknown constant is present in the IVODEs. The value of the unknown (constant) initial value is calculated the same way. If there is an unknown initial value, two final values will be known. One will be used to specify the stopping criterion and the other will be used to calculate the unknown initial value. As before, the value of this unknown constant must be calculated before the IVODE solver is called. The only difference is that after it is calculated, it must be made available at the point in the code where the IVODE solver is called, but not in the derivatives function.\nSpecifying the stopping criterion is straightforward. The final value or values are always known or can be calculated from other known constants provided as part of the assignment. Specifying the stopping criterion simply entails identifying which variable’s final value is known and providing that value. The initial values and the stopping criterion are passed directly to the IVODE solver when it is called, so as already noted, they must be calculated before the IVODE solver is called.\n\n\nJ.3.3 Calculating the Unknown Constant\nMany of the examples presented in Reaction Engineering Basics that require solving a set of IVODEs do not have an unknown constant either in the equations or as an initial value. In examples that do have an unknown constant, there will only be one, either an unknown constant appearing in the IVODEs or an unknown initial value. In both cases, the unknown constant is calculated using a second known final value. (The other known final value is used to specify the stopping criterion.)\nTo illustrate, let \\(a\\) represent the unknown constant, let \\(x_f\\) represent the first known final value, let \\(y_{i,f}\\) represent the second known final value, and let \\(y_i\\big\\vert_{x=x_f}\\) represent the final value that is found by solving the IVODEs. The unknown constant, \\(a\\), can be described as the value of \\(a\\) that results in \\(y_i\\big\\vert_{x=x_f}\\), being equal to \\(y_{i,f}\\), or in mathematical terms as \\(a: y_i\\big\\vert_{x=x_f} = y_{i,f}\\). This description can be converted to an implicit equation for \\(a\\) shown in Equation J.15. That equation is written in the form of a residual expression (see Appendix I), anticipating that it will be solved numerically using an ATE solver. Put differently Equation J.15 can be treated as an ATE with \\(a\\) as the only unknown.\n\\[\n0 = y_i\\big\\vert_{x=x_f} - y_{i,f} = \\epsilon\n\\tag{J.15}\\]\nThe numerical solution of ATEs like this is described in Appendix I. Very briefly, to calculate \\(a\\), an ATE solver is called passing two arguments. The first argument is a guess for \\(a\\) and the second is a residuals function written by the reaction engineer. The residuals functions receives a guess for \\(a\\). It makes it available to the code that needs it, and then calls an IVODE solver to solve the IVODEs. Finally, it uses the results from solving the IVODEs to evaluate and return the residual, Equation J.15. When the ATE solver returns the value of \\(a\\), it is made available to other code as necessary. At that point, the IVODEs can be solved.",

    "text": "J.6 Examples\nExample J.6.1 shows how to solve a set of IVODEs numerically when there are no unknown constants within the equations, all of the initial values are known, and one final value is known. Additionally, it illustrates using the mass matrix to write the derivatives function as described in Section J.3.1. Examples J.6.2 and J.6.2 illustrates the solution of a set of IVODEs when an initial value or constant in the IVODEs is unknown but a second final value is specified. In Example J.6.2 an initial value is unknown and in Example J.6.3 a constant appearing in the IVODEs is unknown.\n\nJ.6.1 Example: Numerical Solution of a Set of IVODEs\nThis is not an example of a reactor analysis; it simply illustrates how to solve a set of IVODEs when all of the initial values are known. Equations (1) through (6) with the initial values, \\(n_{A,0}\\) = \\(n_{B,0}\\) = 190 mol, \\(n_{Y,0}\\) = \\(n_{Z,0}\\) = 0, \\(T_0\\) = 450 K, and \\(P_0\\) = 7 atm, and the final value, \\(t_f\\) = 2 h, are representative of a set of IVODEs that an engineer might generate during the analysis of an adiabatic BSTR. For this illustration we will assume that the engineer knows the constant values of the following quantities: \\(V\\) = 2 m3, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -3470 cal mol-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\) = 7.5 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,B}\\) = 8.5 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Y}\\) = 12.1 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Z}\\) = 5.7 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 83.0 m3 mol-1 h-1, and \\(E_1\\) = 10.2 kcal mol-1, as well as the rate expression, equation (7).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -Vr_1 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = -Vr_1 \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Y}{dt} = Vr_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = Vr_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(n_A \\hat{C}_{p,A} + n_B \\hat{C}_{p,B} + n_Y \\hat{C}_{p,Y} + n_Z \\hat{C}_{p,Z} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt} = -Vr_1 \\Delta H_1 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nRT\\frac{dn_A}{dt} + RT\\frac{dn_B}{dt} &+ RT\\frac{dn_Y}{dt} + RT\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} \\\\&+ R\\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\\right)\\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\n\\end{align} \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_{0,1} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} C_AC_B \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe narrative for this example assigned appropriate variable symbols to every quantity it provided. I can see that I’m going to need the ideal gas constant, so I’ll add it to the given constant quantities. The narrative doesn’t say so, but a subscripted “1” denotes the reaction, “0” denotes values at \\(t=0\\), and “f” denotes final values. It also doesn’t say what quantities are of interest to the reaction engineer. The purpose here is to illustrate solving IVODEs, and doing so yields corresponding sets of values of the independent variable and the dependent variables spanning the range from their initial value to their final values. I’ll just use \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\), etc. to denote those quantities in my summary.\n\n\n\n\nJ.6.1.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(n_{A,0}\\) = \\(n_{B,0}\\) = 190 mol, \\(n_{Y,0}\\) = \\(n_{Z,0}\\) = 0, \\(T_0\\) = 450 K, \\(P_0\\) = 7 atm, \\(t_f\\) = 2 h, \\(V\\) = 2 m3, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -6870 cal mol-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\) = 7.5 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,B}\\) = 8.5 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Y}\\) = 12.1 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Z}\\) = 5.7 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 83.0 m3 mol-1 h-1, \\(E_1\\) = 10.2 kcal mol-1, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1 = 8.206 x 10-2 L atm mol-1 K-1.\nReactor: Adiabatic BSTR\nQuantities of Interest: \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Y\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(P\\left(t\\right)\\).\n\n\nJ.6.1.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally the reactor design equations would need to be generated based on information provided in the narrative, but here they are simply given. The narrative doesn’t say so, but equations (1) - (4) are mole balances, equation (5) is an energy balance on the reacting fluid, and equation (6) is a differential form of the ideal gas law.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z are presented in equations (1) through (4). The energy balance on the reacting fluid is given in equation (5). Equation (6) is the ideal gas law in differential form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor in this illustration is a BSTR. Defining \\(t=0\\) as the instant the reagents were added to the reactor allows specification of the initial and final values.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\n\nTable J.1: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the IVODEs, equations (1) through (6).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_f\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(n_{B,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Y\\)\n\\(n_{Y,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(n_{Z,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(P\\)\n\\(P_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the IVODEs numerically I’ll need to do two things: calculate the values of the derivatives at the start of each integration step and calculate all of the initial and final values in Table J.1.\nI’ll start by writing the equations that I’ll need in order to evaluate the derivatives appearing in the reactor design equations. As given in the narrative, the reactor design equations are not in the form of derivative expressions. They need to be re-written in that form, and Section J.3.1 describes how to do that using a mass matrix.\nI’ll need to evaluate the derivatives at the start of each integration step. At that point, the independent and dependent variables will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions.\nThe only other variable appearing in these IVODEs is \\(r_1\\). According to the narrative, the engineer knows the rate expression is equation (7), and that can be used to calculate \\(r_1\\). However, using the rate expression as an ancillary equation to calculate \\(r_1\\) introduces two additional variables, \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\), so I need to write ancillary equations for them, too. The necessary equations are simply defining equations for concentration in a BSTR. A reaction engineer would know these definitions.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\nThe IVODEs, equations (1) through (6) can be written as the matrix equation, (10), with the mass matrix defined as shown in equation (11). The IVODEs can then be written as derivative expressions as shown in equation (12).\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{M}\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} n_A \\\\ n_B \\\\ n_Y \\\\ n_Z \\\\ T \\\\ P \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -Vr_1 \\\\ -Vr_1 \\\\ Vr_1 \\\\ Vr_1 \\\\ -Vr_1\\Delta H_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{M} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\left(n_A \\hat{C}_{p,A} + n_B \\hat{C}_{p,B} + n_Y \\hat{C}_{p,Y} + n_Z \\hat{C}_{p,Z} \\right) & -V \\\\ RT & RT & RT & RT & R\\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\\right) & -V  \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{dn_A}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{n_B}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{n_Y}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{n_Z}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{T}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{P}{dt} \\end{bmatrix} = \\boldsymbol{M}^{-1} \\begin{bmatrix} -Vr_1 \\\\ -Vr_1 \\\\ Vr_1 \\\\ Vr_1 \\\\ -Vr_1\\Delta H_1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nThe rate expression for \\(r_1\\) is given, equation (7). The concentrations appearing in it can be calculated using equations (8) and (9).\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_B = \\frac{n_B}{V} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to know the initial and final values in Table J.1. In this illustration, they are all given constants, so I don’t need equations to calculate any of them.\nSolving the IVODEs will yield all of the quantities of interest, so no additional equations are needed. I can conclude the numerical formulation with a summary of how to use the equations I’ve written.\n\n\n\nCalculations Summary\n\nSubstitute given and known constants into all equations.\nWhen it is necessary to evaluate the derivatives\n\n\\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(P\\) will be available.\nCalculate \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) using equations (8) and (9).\nCalculate \\(r_1\\) using equation (7).\nCalculate the vector on the right side of equation (10).\nCalculate \\(\\boldsymbol{M}\\) using equation (11).\nCalculate the values of the derivatives using equation (12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative expressions could also be generated by algebraic manipulation of the IVODEs. Equations (1) through (4) are already in the form of derivative expressions.\nSubstitution of equation (1) for \\(\\frac{dn_A}{dt}\\), equation (2) for \\(\\frac{dn_B}{dt}\\), equation (3) for \\(\\frac{dn_Y}{dt}\\), and equation (4) for \\(\\frac{dn_Z}{dt}\\) into equation (6) yields equation (13).\n\\[\n-RTVr_1 - RTVr_1 + RTVr_1 + RTVr_1 + R\\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\\right)\\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nR\\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\\right)\\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0 \\tag{13}\n\\]\nSubtracting equation (13) from equation (5) and rearranging yields the derivative expression in equation (14).\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{-Vr_1 \\Delta H_1}{n_A \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,A} - R\\right) + n_B \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,B} - R\\right) + n_Y \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,Y} - R\\right) + n_Z \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,Z} - R\\right)} \\tag{14}\n\\]\nRearrangement of equation (6) and substitution of equation (14) for \\(\\frac{dT}{dt}\\) yields the derivative expression in equation (15).\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{R\\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\\right)}{V}\\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{-R\\left(n_A + n_B + n_Y + n_Z\\right)r_1 \\Delta H_1}{n_A \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,A} - R\\right) + n_B \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,B} - R\\right) + n_Y \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,Y} - R\\right) + n_Z \\left(\\hat{C}_{p,Z} - R\\right)} \\tag{15}\n\\]\nStep 2 in the Calculations Summary would then be replaced as follows:\n\nWhen it is necessary to evaluate the derivatives\n\n\\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(P\\) will be available.\nCalculate \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) using equations (8) and (9).\nCalculate \\(r_1\\) using equation (7).\nCalculate the values of the derivatives using equations (1) - (4), (14) and (15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.6.1.3 Numerical Implementation of the Solution\n\nMake the given and known constants available for use in all functions,\nWrite a derivatives function that\n\nreceives the independent and dependent variables, \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(P\\), as arguments,\nevaluates the derivatives as described in step 2 of the calculations summary, and\nreturns their values.\n\nWrite a reactor model function that\n\ngets corresponding sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(P\\), spanning the range from their initial values to their final values by calling an IVODE solver and passing the following information to it\n\nthe initial values and stopping criterion in Table J.1 and\nthe name of the derivatives function from step 3 above,\n\nchecks that the solver successfully solved the IVODEs, and\nreturns the values returned by the IVODE solver.\n\nSolve the IVODEs by calling the reactor model function.\n\n\n\nJ.6.1.4 Results and Discussion\nThe calculations were performed as described above yielding the results shown in Table J.2\n\n\n\n\nTable J.2: Solution of equations (1) through (6) using the initial values and stopping criterion in Table J.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\) (n)\n\\(n_A\\) (mol)\n\\(n_B\\) (mol)\n\\(n_Y\\) (mol)\n\\(n_Z\\) (mol)\n\\(T\\) (K)\n\\(P\\) (atm)\n\n\n\n\n0.0\n190\n190\n0.0\n0.0\n450\n7\n\n\n8.49 x 10-5\n190\n190\n1.41 x 10-3\n1.41 x 10-3\n450\n7\n\n\n9.34 x 10-4\n190\n190\n1.56 x 10-2\n1.56 x 10-2\n450\n7\n\n\n9.43 x 10-3\n190\n190\n0.157\n0.157\n450\n7\n\n\n9.44 x 10-2\n188\n188\n1.61\n1.61\n452\n7.04\n\n\n0.944\n170\n170\n20.2\n20.2\n480\n7.47\n\n\n2\n129\n129\n60.7\n60.7\n540\n8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike analytical solution, solving the IVODEs numerically does not yield expressions for \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Y\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(n_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(P\\left(t\\right)\\).

As a consequence, if the calculations were performed using a different IVODE solver, there could be fewer or more rows than shown in Table J.2. However, the values shown in the first and last rows would be the same, and interpolation to a common \\(t\\), would give equal values of \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\) and \\(P\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.6.2 Example: Numerical Solution of a Set of IVODEs with a “Missing” Initial Value\nThis is not an example of a reactor analysis; it simply illustrates how to solve a set of IVODEs when one of the initial values is unknown. Equations (1) through (3) are representative of the IVODEs an engineer might need to solve when analyzing an adiabatic, steady-state PFR with negligible pressure drop. Suppose the engineer needs to calculate the initial value of \\(T\\), \\(T_{in}\\), that will result in a specified final value of \\(T\\), \\(T_{out}\\), and then calculate \\(\\dot{n}_A\\left(z\\right)\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\left(z\\right)\\), and \\(T\\left(z\\right)\\) using \\(T_{in}\\). For this example, assume that the engineer knows that equation (4) is the rate expression, and that \\(D\\) = 1 in, \\(k_0\\) = 7.49 x 109 L mol-1 min-1, \\(E\\) = 15,300 cal mol-1, \\(P\\) = 4 atm, \\(\\Delta H\\) = -14,500 cal mol-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\) = 10.9 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Z}\\) = 21.8 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(L\\) = 100 in, \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\) = 1.5 mol min-1, \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\) = 0, and \\(T_{out}\\) = 400 K.\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_A}{dz} = -2\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dz} = -\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\frac{r\\Delta H}{\\dot{n}_A \\hat{C}_{p,A} + \\dot{n}_Z \\hat{C}_{p,Z}} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = k_0exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)} \\left(\\frac{\\dot{n}_AP}{\\left( \\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_Z\\right)RT}\\right)^2 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem statement assigns appropriate variables to represent all of the known constants and the quantities of interest. This is a PFR, so a subscripted “in” denotes initial values (at \\(z=0\\)) and a subscripted “out” represents final values (except that \\(L\\) is used instead of \\(z_{out}\\)). In this example, there is only one reaction, so a subscript denoting the reaction isn’t needed. I can see that I’m going to need the ideal gas constant, so I can add that to the known constants.\n\n\n\n\nJ.6.2.1 Assignment Summary\nGiven and Known Constants: \\(D\\) = 1 in, \\(k_0\\) = 7.49 x 109 L mol-1 min-1, \\(E\\) = 15,300 cal mol-1, \\(P\\) = 4 atm, \\(\\Delta H\\) = -14,500 cal mol-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\) = 10.9 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Z}\\) = 21.8 cal mol-1 K-1, \\(L\\) = 100 in, \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\) = 1.5 mol min-1, \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\) = 0, \\(T_{out}\\) = 400 K, and \\(R\\) = 1.987 cal mol-1 K-1 = 8.206 x 10-2 L atm mol-1 K-1.\nReactor: Adiabatic, steady-state PFR with negligible pressure drop.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(T_{in} : T\\big\\vert_{z=L} = T_{out}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_A\\left(z\\right)\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\left(z\\right)\\), and \\(T\\left(z\\right)\\).\n\n\nJ.6.2.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nReactor design equations are always needed for a reactor analysis.

However, a second final value, the outlet temperature, \\(T_{out}\\), is given. Using that second final value I can write an implicit equation that can be solved to find \\(T_{in}\\) as described in Section J.3.3.

Then, once \\(T_{in}\\) has been found, the IVODEs are solved using the value that the ATE solver returned (step 6d).\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.6.2.4 Results and Discussion\nThe calculations were performed as described above. The required inlet temperature, \\(T_{in}\\), is 334 K.

Equations (1) through (3) are representative IVODEs that a reaction engineer might need to solve when analyzing a steady-state, adiabatic PFR with negligible pressure drop. Suppose the engineer is tasked with finding the volumetric flow rate, \\(\\dot{V}\\), that results in the outlet \\(T\\) being equal to 325 K, and then using that volumetric flow rate, to calculate \\(\\dot{n}_A\\left(z\\right)\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\left(z\\right)\\), and \\(T\\left(z\\right)\\). It can be assumed that the reaction engineer knows that the rate expression for \\(r\\) is equation (4), and the following values: \\(D\\) = 5 cm, \\(\\Delta H\\) = -14,000 cal mol-1, \\(\\breve{C}_p\\) = 1.3 cal cm-3 K-1, \\(C_{A,in}\\) = 0.0025 mol cm3, \\(C_{Z,in}\\) = 0, \\(T_{in}\\) = 300 K, \\(L\\) = 50 cm, \\(k_0\\) = 4.2 x 1015 cm3 mol-1 min-1, and \\(E\\) = 18,000 cal mol-1.\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_A}{dz} = - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Z}{dz} =  \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dz} = - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\frac{r\\Delta H}{\\dot{V} \\breve{C}_p} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = k_0 \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)}\\frac{\\dot{n}_A^2}{\\dot{V}^2} \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe narrative assigns variables to the known constants. It uses a subscripted “in” to denote initial values. I’ll use \\(T_{out}\\) to denote the final (outlet) value of the temperature; the narrative uses \\(L\\) as the final value of \\(z\\).

At that point, the independent and dependent variables will be known along with the given and known constants. I will need to calculate any other quantities that appear in the derivatives expressions. Using the assignment summary, I can see that the only quantities that need to be calculated are the rate, \\(r\\), and the volumetric flow rate, \\(\\dot{V}\\).\nThe rate is a variable that depends upon \\(\\dot_{n}_A\\) and \\(T\\). The rate expression for calculating it is provided. That equation does not introduce any additional unknown quantities, but it does include the volumetric flow rate, \\(\\dot{V}\\).\nThe unknown quantity, \\(\\dot{V} : T\\big\\vert_{z=L} = T_{out}\\), is a constant. It cannot be calculated directly from the other given constants. However since a second final value, \\(T_{out}\\), is given, an implicit equation for calculating it can be written as described in Section J.3.3. Knowing that I will be solving that equation numerically, I’ll write it in the form of a residual (see Appendix I).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations for Evaluating the Derivatives\nThe rate, \\(r\\) appearing in the design equations is given by equation (4). The volumetric flow rate, \\(\\dot{V} : T\\big\\vert_{z=L} = T_{out}\\), can be calculated by using an ATE solver to solve equation, (5), for the value of \\(\\dot{V}\\) that results in \\(T\\big\\vert_{z=L}\\) being equal to \\(T_{out}\\).\n\\[\n0 = T\\big\\vert_{z=L} - T_{out} = \\epsilon \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I solve the IVODEs numerically, I’ll also need to know the initial and final values in Table J.5. The inlet temperature and the length of the reactor are known constants, but the inlet molar flow rates of A and Z, \\(n_{A,in}\\) and \\(n_{Z,in}\\), must be calculated. The inlet concentrations are known, so the definiting equation for concentration in a flow reactor can be used to calculate the inlet molar flow rates.

It must be calculated first and then used when solving the IVODEs. The complication arises because the IVODEs must be solved in order to calculate \\(\\dot{V}\\). The code must be written so that while the ATE solver is testing guesses for \\(\\dot{V}\\), those guesses are used in the solution of the IVODEs.

By doing so, each time the ATE solver tests a guess it has generated, the IVODEs are solved using that guess. Then, once \\(\\dot{V}\\) has been found, the IVODEs are solved using the result.\nThe initial and final values of \\(z\\) and \\(T\\) in Table J.6 are as specified in the description of the assignment. The initial value of \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\) is also as expected because \\(C_{Z,in}\\) is equal to zero. However, if the volumetric flow rate is 400 cm3 min-1 and the feed concentration of A is 0.0025 mol cm3, the inlet molar flow rate of A should equal 1.0, not 0.999 as shown in Table J.6. The reason for this discrepancy is that the actual value of \\(\\dot{V}\\) found by solving equation (5) using an ATE solver was 399.5065292240422 cm3 min-1. Recall (see Appendix I) that numerical solution of ATEs does not yield an exact solution, but one that is “very close.” Clearly that number of significant figures is not warranted, so the value was reported above as 400 cm3 min-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCoRE Connection\n\n\n\nVideos showing how to complete this assignment using either Matlab or Python, along with the Matlab and Python code, are available in SCoRE",

    "text": "K.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Solution of DAEs\nAfter summarizing the assignment, the mathematical formulation of the solution begins with writing the PFR reactor design equations and identifying the initial values and stopping criterion that will be used when solving them. The next step is to write mole and energy balances on the heat exchanger or on the stream splitter and stream mixer. The PFR reactor design equations will be IVODEs and the other mole and energy balances will be ATEs that together make up the set of DAEs being solved.\nThe solution of the DAEs starts with the ATEs. The number of unknown quantities appearing in the ATEs will be greater than the number of ATEs. The unknown quantities will include initial values of the IVODE dependent variables, final values of the IVODE dependent variables, and other unknown quantities. The key to solving the DAEs is that the ATEs are solved to find the unknown IVODE initial values and the other unknown quantities. It is critically important that the ATEs are not solved to find the unknown IVODE final values.\nAs described in Appendix I, when an ATE solver is used to solve the ATEs numerically, it must be provided with two things. The first is an initial guess for the solution of the ATEs. The second is a residuals function. The residuals function must accept a guess for the solution as an argument. It must use that guess to calculate the values of any remaining unknown quantities appearing in the residuals expressions, evaluate the residuals, and return their values.\nSo, for this type of DAEs, when the residuals function receives a guess for the solution of the ATEs, that guess will include values for the IVODE initial values. Using those initial values, the IVODEs can be solved numerically to get the IVODE final values. Then, using those final values, the residuals can be evaluated and returned.\nThe key point is that the IVODEs are solved numerically within the residuals function, because within the residuals function the necessary initial values are available. The numerical solution of the IVODEs can be accomplished exactly as described in Appendix J.",

There are 7 ATEs, equations (5) through (11), but they contain 13 unknown quantities: \\(\\dot{n}_{A,r}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,r}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\), \\(T_{in}\\), \\(\\dot{V}_r\\), \\(\\dot{T}_r\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{A,out}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{A,prod}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,out}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,prod}\\), \\(T_{out}\\), and \\(T_{prod}\\). I can find 7 of the unknown quantities by solving the ATEs. The others will need to be calculated at the point where the residuals need to be evaluated.\nI also know that the initial IVODE values in Table K.1 must be among the 7 variables found by solving the ATEs, and the final IVODE values cannot be among them. I will solve the ATEs for \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\), \\(T_{in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{A,prod}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,prod}\\), \\(T_{prod}\\), and \\(T_r\\).\nWith that choice, at the point where the residuals need to be evaluated, I will have values for those 7 variables, but I’ll need to calculate the other 6 unknown quantities. Since I’ll know \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\), and \\(T_{in}\\), I can solve the PFR design equations for \\(\\dot{n}_A\\left(z\\right)\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\left(z\\right)\\), and \\(T\\left(z\\right)\\). The resulting final values are then equal to \\(\\dot{n}_{A,out}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,out}\\), and \\(T_{out}\\). Finally, I can use equations (13) through (16) to calculate \\(\\dot{n}_{A,r}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,r}\\), and \\(\\dot{V}_r\\).\n\n\n\nThe ATEs, equations (5) through (11) can be solved numerically to find \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\), \\(T_{in}\\), \\(T_r\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{A,prod}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,prod}\\), and \\(T_{prod}\\). At the point where the residuals must be evaluated, the molar flow rates and temperature at the reactor outlet can be found by solving the PFR design equations numerically for corresponding values of \\(z\\), \\(\\dot{n_A}\\), \\(\\dot{n_Z}\\), and \\(T\\) that span the range from \\(z=0\\) to \\(z=L\\).

    "text": "L.1 Defining the Problem\nParameter estimation requires experimental data. In each experiment, the person performing the experiments sets the values of one or more quantities. Herein, the variables used to represent those quantities are referred to as the adjusted input variables. After setting those values, the experimenter then records the values of other quantities. The variables used to represent these other quantities are referred to as the experimental responses. In Reaction Engineering Basics only experiments with a single experimental response are considered. Every experiment performed involves the same set of adjusted input variables and the same experimental response, but their values are different from experiment to experiment.\nOften, the reason someone performs experiments like these is because they believe that the response depends upon the values of the adjusted input variables. Based upon that belief, they propose a mathematical response model. The values of the adjusted input variables from any one experiment can be substituted into the response model permitting the calculation of a model-predicted response for that experiment. Typically the response model contains one or more unknown constants, called the model parameters.\nIt is important to understand that even if the model is correct and the values of the model parameters are known exactly, the model-predicted response for any one experiment will not be exactly equal to the experimental response. Measured values, such as the experimental response, always include random error. Put differently, if the same experiment was performed 10 times, 10 slightly different experimental responses could be recorded. Given a response model (including the values of the parameters appearing in it), the difference between the experimental response and the model-predicted response for any one experiment is called the error or the residual for that one experiment.\nReturning to the reason the experiments were performed, the person who performed them believes that the response depends upon the values of the adjusted input variables. However, they do not know what the correct response model is. Therefore, when they propose a response model, they don’t know whether the proposed model is correct and they don’t know the values of the parameters that the proposed model contains. The purposes of parameter estimation are first, to calculate the “best” values of the parameters in the proposed model, second, to estimate the uncertainty in each parameter value, and third, to provide some measure of how accurately the model predicts the experimental responses.\nThis raises the question of how to define the “best” values of the model parameters. If the error (i. e. the difference between the experimental response and the model-predicted response) for each experiment is squared and then the resulting squares of the errors are added together, the most common definition for the “best” parameter values is that the sum of the squares of the errors is minimized when the “best” values of the parameters are used in the response model. The squares of the errors are used instead of the errors themselves so that positive and negative errors don’t cancel each other out. For this reason, parameter estimation is sometimes referred to as “least-squares fitting.” An alternative definition of the “best” parameter values uses the sum of the squares of the relative errors. The use of this definition is considered in the final section of this appendix.",

    "text": "L.5 Assessing the Accuracy of the Model\nTypically, if successful, the solver will return (a) the estimated values of the model parameters, (b) some measure of the uncertainty in the estimated values (e. g. a 95% confidence interval) and (c) the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\).\nThe estimated values of the model parameters can be used to compute the model-predicted response for each experiment. A “parity plot” can then be created wherein the model-predicted response is plotted versus the experimental response. If the model was perfect, every point in the parity plot would fall on a diagonal line passing through the origin. The farther the points are from the diagonal, the lower the accuracy of the model.\nThe errors, or residuals, for each experiment can also be calculated. A set of “residuals plots” can then be created wherein the residuals are plotted versus each of the experimental adjusted input variables. If the model was perfect, every residual would equal zero and every point in every residuals plot would fall on the horizontal axis. The magnitude of the deviations from the horizontal axis is not important (the parity plot is used for this purpose). The critical issue whether the points scatter randomly above and below the horizontal axis as the value of the adjusted input variable increases. When the model is good, there should not be any trends in the deviations as the value of the adjusted input variable increases.\nDeciding whether the model is sufficiently accurate is a judgement call. The following criteria are satisfied by an accurate model.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), is nearly equal to 1.\nThe uncertainty in each model parameter is small compared to its value.\nThe points in the parity plot are all close to a diagonal line passing through the origin.\nIn each residuals plot, the points scatter randomly about the horizontal axis, and no systematic deviations are apparent.",

    "section": "L.6 Cautions Related to Parameter Estimation",
    "text": "L.6 Cautions Related to Parameter Estimation\nA few issues should be kept in mind when performing numerical parameter estimation. The first is that the solver may converge to a local minimum of the sum of the squares of the errors and not the global minimum. This could result in a model that does not appear to be accurate, but that could be accurate if the global minimum was located. One way to try to detect this situation is to repeat the parameter estimation using a very different initial guess. If the solver converges to a different set of estimated parameters, that indicates that one (or possibly both) of the sets of estimated parameters corresponds to a local minimum. If a wide range of initial guesses always leads to the same parameter estimates, that may suggest the a global minimum has been found, and it is the model, itself, that is not accurate.\nThe second issue arises when initially guessing the value of a model parameter that might fall anywhere in a very wide range of values. As an example, in Reaction Engineering Basics problems, the pre-exponential factor for a rate coefficient could have a value anywhere between 10-20 and 1020. In this situation, if the initial guess is not sufficiently close to the actual value of the parameter, the solver may quit because it is not making progress. One way to reduce the likelihood of this happening is to use the base-10 logarithm of the parameter instead of the parameter itself. That is, if \\(k_0\\) is the actual parameter of interest in the model, re-write the model replacing \\(k_0\\) with \\(10^\\beta\\). Then perform parameter estimation to find the best value of \\(\\beta\\). When the possible range of \\(k_0\\) is between 10-20 and 1020, the corresponding range of \\(\\beta\\) is between -20 and 20. Once the best value \\(\\beta\\) has been found, the best value of \\(k_0\\) is simply calculated as \\(k_0 = 10^\\beta\\).\nThe third issue arises when the experimental responses span several orders of magnitude. In this situation, the errors associated with larger values of the response may be greater than errors associated with smaller values of the response. If that is so, the minimization process will focus on the responses with larger values because they have a greater effect upon the sum of the squares of the errors. One option for addressing this situation is to minimize the sum of the squares of the relative errors instead of the sum of the squares of the absolute errors.",

    "section": "M.3 Items that Must be Provided to the Solver",
    "text": "M.3 Items that Must be Provided to the Solver\nAs in the other numerical methods appendices, the term “solver” is used here to refer to the computer program or function that numerically solves a set of BVODEs. There are many different BVODE solvers available, and each has specific instructions on how to use it. This appendix makes no attempt to explain the details of using any one of the available solvers.\nHowever, no matter which specific solver one uses, there are six things that must be provided to the solver. The first of two of these are the values of \\(x\\) at each end of the range where the BVODEs are valid. In terms of Equations M.4 through M.6 this means providing the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In the example here, Equations M.1 through M.3, those values are 0 and \\(L\\).\nThe process for solving the BVODEs requires dividing the range of \\(x\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into a number of small intervals. The third thing that must be supplied to the solver is the number of intervals to be used. Generally a larger number of intervals results in a more accurate answer, but increases the computation time.\nThe fourth thing that must be provided to the solver is a guess for the values of the dependent variables. The form in which this is provided might vary depending on the specific software being used. In the simplest case, the fourth item is simply a guess for the average value of \\(C_A\\) between \\(z=0\\) and \\(z=L\\) and a guess for the average value of \\(w\\) between \\(z=0\\) and \\(z=L\\). In a more demanding case, this might entail providing a guess for the values of \\(C_A\\) and \\(w\\) at the boundary of each of the intervals between \\(z=0\\) and \\(z=L\\).\nThe fifth thing that must be provided to the BVODE solver is a means of calculating the values of each of the first order derivatives, given values for the independent variable and the dependent variables. Quite commonly, this is done by providing the name of a function or subroutine to the solver. That subroutine receives values of the independent variable and the dependent variables as arguments. It then uses the expressions for the first-order ODEs being solved, Equations M.7 and M.8 in the present example, to calculate the values of the derivatives, \\(\\frac{dC_A}{dz}\\) and \\(\\frac{dw}{dz}\\), and returns them.\nThe final thing that must be provided to the BVODE solver is a means of evaluating the boundary conditions, i. e. a means of evaluating the residual functions, \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\), given values for the dependent variables, \\(y\\) and \\(w\\), at each of the boundaries, \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\). Again, this is commonly done by providing the name of another function or subroutine to the solver. That subroutine receives \\(y \\Big\\rvert_{x=a}\\), \\(w \\Big\\rvert_{x=a}\\), \\(y \\Big\\rvert_{x=b}\\) and \\(w \\Big\\rvert_{x=b}\\) as arguments. It then calculates the values of \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) and returns them. In the present example, this second subroutine would receive \\(C_A \\Bigr\\rvert_{z=0}\\), \\(C_A \\Bigr\\rvert_{z=L}\\), \\(w\\Bigr\\rvert_{z=0}\\), and \\(w\\Bigr\\rvert_{z=L}\\) as arguments, use Equations M.9 and M.10 to evaluate the residuals, and return them.",

    "text": "M.4 A Simplified Description of How the BVODEs are Solved\nThe description in this section is highly simplified, and it leaves out some details. It is intended only to provide a sense of how BVODEs are solved numerically. To start, the solver uses the information provided to it to divide the \\(x\\) range into many small intervals. It uses an approximating polynomial, e. g. \\(y = m_1x^3 + m_2x^2 + m_3x + m_4\\), to approximate each dependent variable in each of the intervals. That is, the values of \\(m_1\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_3\\), and \\(m_4\\) will be different for each dependent variable and in each interval. At this point those values are unknown, and solving the BVODEs equates to finding those values. Note that \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) can also be approximated by taking the derivative of the approximating polynomial. The equations used to find the values of the coefficients are based on requirements that the solution must meet.\n\nAt the boundary between any two intervals, the approximating polynomials on each side must yield the same value of \\(y\\).\nAt the two ends of the range of \\(x\\), the approximating polynomials must satisfy the boundary conditions in Equations M.5 and M.6.\nAt any point within an interval, the approximating functions must obey the ODEs, Equations M.7 and M.8.\n\nThere is an infinite number of points within the interval, so to meet this requirement distinct points within each interval, called collocation points, are chosen and this requirement is applied at those points. Typically, the collocation points include the two ends of the interval and as many equally-spaced points in between as are needed to calculate the values of \\(m_1\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_3\\), and \\(m_4\\) for every dependent variable in every interval.\n\n\nApplying those requirements leads to a set of non-linear equations that needs to be solved to find the values of \\(m_1\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_3\\), and \\(m_4\\) for every dependent variable in every interval. See Appendix I for an overview of how that is accomplished. Doing so requires an initial guess for the values; the solver generates the guess using the guess for the value of \\(y\\) that is provided to it.",

    "text": "M.5 Cautions Related to Numerical Solution\nThe process of dividing the range of \\(x\\) into intervals is sometimes called mesh generation. The presentation here implied that the intervals were equally sized, but this is not required. If the solution varies very stronly in one part of the range of \\(x\\) and not in other parts, it is possible to use smaller intervals where it is varying strongly and larger intervals elsewhere. This can increase the accuracy of the result without increasing the amount of computation required.\nA related caution is that some solvers will adjust the number of intervals in order to maintain accuracy. As such, the number of intervals returned by the solver should not be assumed to equal the number specified in the call to the solver.\nIt won’t be encountered in Reaction Engineering Basics, but when BVODEs are written in cylindrical or spherical coordinates, a term may contain \\(x^{-1}\\). Then, if the range of \\(x\\) includes \\(0\\), that term will become infinite at that point. This is known as a singularity. If the BVODEs have such a singluarity, there are methods that have not been discussed here that can be used to solve them.",
