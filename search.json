    "text": "Preface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaction Engineering Basics is not yet complete\n\n\n\n\n\nI am still writing Reaction Engineering Basics. Everything for which a first draft has been completed is included here. As drafts of missing chapters are completed, they will be added. Once I have completed first drafts of all of the chapters and appendices, I will do a final revision and proofreading. At that point I will take this callout down and add a capability for readers to report errors.\n\n\n\nReaction Engineering Basics is an introductory textbook on chemical kinetics and reaction engineering. There are many excellent introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks. Like many other textbooks, Reaction Engineering Basics, limits kinetics data analysis problems to isothermal systems with a single reaction taking place (though it does not limit the analysis to systems where linear least squares can be used). However, as it moves into the area of reaction engineering, Reaction Engineering Basics is different from many other textbooks in two respects. First, Reaction Engineering Basics does not start with systems with single reactions taking place in isothermal reactors and then introduce systems with multiple reactions or systems requiring an energy balance in subsequent chapters. The reaction engineering section of Reaction Engineering Basics starts with systems that require mole and energy balances and that feature multiple reactions. Second, Reaction Engineering Basics differs from many other introductory kinetics and reaction engineering textbooks by using numerical methods to solve almost all of the problems it presents. The one exception is that analytic algebra is used when generating rate expressions for non-elementary reactions from proposed mechanisms for those reactions.\nReaction Engineering Basics was written for use in an undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum. The intended audience is students who have completed approximately two years of a four-year chemical engineering degree program. While very brief overviews of important topics are included, generally Reaction Engineering Basics assumes that readers have completed two semesters of general chemistry, a course on chemical engineering mass and energy balances and, ideally, a course on chemical engineering thermodynamics. Proficiency in algebra, calculus and differential equations is also assumed. Appendix A provides a few more specifics on prerequisite knowledge."

    "text": "Practice Problems and Numerical Methods\nEach chapter of Reaction Engineering Basics includes illustrative example problems with solutions. Beyond showing what to do to solve the problem, the solutions attempt to expose expert thinking by describing how an expert knows to do those things. The solutions describe in detail how to solve the problems, in most cases using numerical methods. They also present and discuss the results from solving the problem. However, the solutions in Reaction Engineering Basics do not include actual computer code used to solve the problems.\nInstead, the solutions are written in a way that should make it easy for students to implement the calculations using computational tools they are familiar with, that are available to them or, if using this textbook as part of a formal course, that are required by the course instructor. In this way, Reaction Engineering Basics is not tied to any one brand of software or computational tool.\nAn online Self-study Course on Reaction Engineering, SCoRE, is planned as soon as Reaction Engineering Basics is completed. Video solutions to most Reaction Engineering Basics example problems will be available in SCoRE. These will include detailed explanations of how the numerical computations can be performed using either Python or Matlab. SCoRE will also provide Python and Matlab utility functions for the essential numerical methods used in Reaction Engineering Basics. Python was chosen because it is freely available online; Matlab was chosen because it is licensed by many universities (including the author’s) for instructional use. As part of presenting solutions to Reaction Engineering Basics example problems, the video solutions that are included in SCoRE will describe how to write and execute the necessary code.\nReaction Engineering Basics does not include end-of-chapter practice problems. Once again, practice problems with solutions, will be available in SCoRE."

    "text": "Acknowledgements\nI could use any number of clichés here, but instead I’ll just say that my wife, Deb, has been unbelievably supportive of me in my career, and particularly as I wrote this book. I owe her a debt that I can’t hope to repay, but at the very least, I can thank and acknowledge her for all she has done and continues to do. So thanks, Deb, you’re the best!\nI was fortunate and blessed to receive a fantastic formal eduction. From grade school through graduate school I’ve been taught by many outstanding educators, and I thank them all. Two in particular stand out. Jim Dumesic, “the Boss,” is one. When he became my PhD advisor, I expected it to be a 4 to 5 year deal. It wasn’t. Jim has been my mentor, trusted advisor and true friend ever since that day. For over forty years, he’s always been there for me, and I can’t thank him enough. The other standout is Phil Wankat. Without going into the details, I was ready to change majors after my first undergraduate chemical engineering course. It didn’t happen because Phil Wankat taught the second chemical engineering course I took, one on stagewise separations. He is the best teacher I ever had, and his teaching and personality are directly responsible for me being a chemical engineer today.\nThe University at Buffalo, its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and its Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering have been my professional home since 1986. They have provided an environment that is equally supportive of educational innovation and, in my case, catalysis and reaction engineering research. I appreciate that educational innovation is not only supported, it is recognized and rewarded.\nPersonally, I believe there is a God who blessed me with the ability, circumstances and perseverence to write this book."

    "section": "1.1 Chemical Reactions",
    "text": "1.1 Chemical Reactions\n\n1.1.1 Defining and Characterizing Chemical Reactions\nA chemical reaction involves a group of atoms. Before the reaction occurs, there are bonds between some of the atoms, so that the system consists of one or more molecules and/or free atoms. Collectively, these chemical species are called the reactants. A chemical reaction is a molecular event wherein at least one chemical bond is broken or formed. As a consequence, after the reaction occurs, the system consists of a different set of chemical species. Collectively, these chemical species are called the products.\nAs an example Figure 1.1 shows a schematic representation of a system containing two oxygen atoms and four hydrogen atoms. In Figure 1.1 (a), the oxygen atoms are bonded to each other and each of the hydrogen atoms is bonded to one other hydrogen atom. As a result, there are three chemical species or reagents: an O2 molecule and 2 H2 molecules. If this is the state of a chemical system before a reaction occurs, this group of reagents could be referred to, collectively, as the reactants. When a chemical reaction occurs, the bonding between the atoms in the system changes. For example, Figure 1.1 (b) shows the same six atoms, but the bonding among them is different. Each of the oxygen atoms is bonded to two hydrogen atoms giving two chemical species both being water molecules. If this is the state of the chemical system after the reaction has occurred, then this group of reagents, collectively, is called the products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Reactants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Products\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: In a chemical reaction, the atoms do not change, but the bonding between them does change.\n\n\nSo to summarize the example, before the reaction, the chemical system consisted of three reactants: an O2 molecule and two H2 molecules. The reaction changed the bonding among the atoms, so that after the reaction the chemical system consisted of two species, the products, both being water molecules. It is very important to recognize that the exact same set of six atoms is present throughout the process. This is the basis of chemical reaction stoichiometry. Stoichiometry is examined in more detail in the next sub-section.\nIt’s important to understand that chemical reactions are bi-directional. In terms of the example here, a chemical system might initially contain two water molecules, and a chemical reaction could occur to produce one oxygen molecule and 2 hydrogen molecules. What that means, among other things, is that the identity of the reactants and the identity of the products is context specific. In one situation, two H2O molecules might be the reactants with O2 and two H2 as the products, and in a different situation, O2 and two H2 might be the reactants and 2 H2O, the products.\nThere is another very important subtlety to the definition of a chemical reaction as a molecular process that converts reactants into products, by changing the bonding among the atoms. Specifically, the issue is whether all the bonds break and form simultaneously, or, alternatively, whether the process occurs in more than one step. Figure 1.2 shows that same representation of the hydrogen combustion reaction, but with the reactant bonds that will break colored red and the bonds that will form colored green. This particular reaction is unusual in that every bond in the reactants breaks and four new oxygen-hydrogen bonds form.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: When molecular hydrogen is oxidized three bonds (red) break and four bonds (green) form.\n\n\nIf all of the bond breaking and forming occurs simultaneously, then this reaction would be called an elementary reaction. In an elementary reaction, all of the reactants come very close to each other, and all of the bonds that are going to do so begin to break or form. While this is happening, the system consists of a single species. That species is call the activated complex. The lifetime of the activated complex is extremely short. Even as the reactants are forming the activated complex, it is beginning to break apart into the products.\nThe alternative is that the bond breaking and forming is not simultaneous, but it occurs sequentially. Given the large number of bonds that are breaking and forming during hydrogen combustion, it is likely that they break and form sequentially. That would mean that hydrogen combustion is a non-elementary reaction. Instead of a single reaction event where all of the bonds break and form, the O2 molecule and one of the H2 molecules might react to form two hydroxyl radicals. Products like these hydroxyl radicals are often called intermediates or reactive intermediates. The reactive intermediates do not have to be free radicals, they also can be neutral species with all electrons paired or they can be ions. One key feature of the intermediates is that their lifetimes are very short compared to the lifetime of the reactants and products.\nContinuing with hydrogen combustion, if the first step resulted in formation of two hydroxyl radicals, then those radicals would react very quickly. That might generate new intermediates, and they, too, would react quickly. The net result is that the reactants are converted to intermediates that, in turn, are very quickly converted to products. While the intermediates react very rapidly, they are present and could be detected using sophisticated equipment. As such, their lifetimes are longer than an activated complex in an elementary reaction, but still quite short.\nAnother way to look at the intermediates is to remember that from a macroscopic perspective it appears that the single non-elementary reaction is all that is happening. If the intermediates were present in significant quantity, then from a macroscopic perspective, they would be observed, and it would no longer appear that only one reaction was taking place. So while it appears that only one reaction is taking place from a macroscopic perspective, if one was able to observe the system at the microscopic or molecular level, it would be seen that actually more than one reaction was taking place and that the intermediates were being formed and consumed in those reactions.\nIt is worth noting that the number of reactant molecules participating in a chemical reaction event is used as one means of classifying reactions. If there is only one reactant in a chemical reaction event, that reaction can be referred to as a unimolecular reaction. If there are two reactants, either two of the same molecule or one each of two different molecules, the reaction can be referred to as a bimolecular reaction. A termolecular reaction has three reactant molecules. When a single molecule is the only reactant and there is also a single molecule as the only product, the reaction can additionally be called an intramolecular reaction. In an intramolecular reaction all bond breaking and forming is internal to the single molecule involved in the reaction. Other means of classifying reactions are described later in this chapter.\n\n\n1.1.2 Chemical Reaction Stoichiometry\nThe preceding sub-section defined a chemical reaction as a molecular process wherein reactants were converted to products due to changes in the chemical bonding. The fact that the number of atoms and their identities do not change, but the bonding between them does change is the basis of chemical reaction stoichiometry. Before discussing stoichiometry, though, it may be worth noting that the word “reaction” has two meanings. One use of the word “reaction” refers to the molecular process as previously defined. But the word “reaction” is also used to refer to the written expression that is used to represent and describe that molecular process.\nFor example, in the preceding sub-section the word “reaction” was used to refer to a molecular bond breaking and forming process involving hydrogen and oxygen atoms. That process can be represented by the following expression.\n\\[\n2 H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2 H_2O\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\nThe word “reaction” is used to refer to the molecular event, and it is also used to refer to the expression, e. g. Reaction 1.1. In most circumstances, these two uses for the word “reaction” don’t cause any confusion. In this sub-section, however, they might. Therefore, for the remainder of this sub-section the phrase “molecular reaction event” will be used to refer to the molecular event and the phrase “reaction expression” will be used to refer to the expression representing that event.\nEach time the molecular reaction event occurs the same number of molecules of each reactant is converted into the same number of molecules of each product. For example every time the hydrogen combustion molecular reaction event occurs, one O2 molecule and two H2 molecules are converted into two water molecules. The fixed proportions in which the reactants and products participate are referred to collectively as the stoichiometry of the reaction.\nHere’s that reaction expression for hydrogen combustion again.\n\\[\n2 H_2 + O_2 \\rightarrow 2 H_2O\n\\]\nIn this case, the reaction expression contains an arrow that points to the right. To the left of the arrow the chemical formula for each unique reactant in the molecular reaction event is written. The chemical formulae of the reactants are separated by plus signs, and each is preceded by the number of molecules of that species that participates in the molecular reaction event. If no number precedes the chemical formula, that implies a value of one. Hence here we see a 2 preceding the H2 in the reaction expression because two H2 molecules participate as reactants in the hydrogen combustion reaction event. A plus sign then separates the chemical formula for H2 from that for O2, because O2 also participates as a reactant in the hydrogen combustion reaction event. The absence of a number preceding the O2 implies a value of 1, which is the number of O2 molecules that participate in the reaction event as reactants. The numbers preceding the chemical species are called stoichiometric coefficients. The arrow in the reaction expression points to a similar listing of the chemical species that are products in the molecular reaction event.\nA number of different styles of arrows are used when writing reaction expressions. The style of the arrow sometimes has special meaning. For example, sometimes a double arrow is used where there are two arrows one above the other and pointing in opposite directions (\\(\\rightleftarrows\\)). A double arrow is a reminder that chemical reactions are bidirectional. It sometimes additionally signifies that the reaction is reversible, a concept that will be discussed later in this chapter.\nReturning to the reaction expression for hydrogen combustion, a common way of reading a reaction expression is to read the reactants, say “goes to” and then read the products. Here, for example one could read the reaction expression as two H2 plus one O2 goes to two H2O. Because chemical reaction events are bi-directional, the reaction as written in the reaction expression is sometimes called the forward reaction. For the reaction as written here, then, the reaction event where two water molecules react to form two hydrogen molecules and an oxygen molecule can be referred to as the reverse reaction.\nNotice that the total number of each type of atom on the left side of the reaction expression is equal to the total number of that type of atom on the right side of the reaction expression. This is a consequence of reaction stoichiometry, and it must be true for every element that appears in a reaction expression. When it is true, the reaction expression is said to be balanced.\nThe reaction expression for hydrogen oxidation, above, is balanced because there are four H atoms on each side of the arrow and two O atoms on each side of the arrow. In that reaction expression, the number preceding each chemical formula is equal to the number of that species that participate in the molecular reaction event. This is not required, though. The reaction expression only needs to convey the proportions in which the reagents appear in the molecular reaction event, and not necessarily the exact number of molecules of the reagents.\n\\[\nH_2 + \\frac{1}{2} O_2 \\rightarrow H_2O\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nReaction 1.2 is an equally valid reaction expression for hydrogen combustion. Clearly, the stoichiometric coefficients here are not equal to the number of the molecules in the molecular reaction event, because there is no such thing as one-half of an O2 molecule. Nevertheless, it is sometimes convenient to write the reaction expression so that the stoichiometric coefficient of one of the products has a magnitude of one. An example is the reaction expression used for a heat of formation (see Appendix C). It still is required that the reaction expression be balanced. In Reaction 1.2 there are 2 H atoms and 1 O atom on each side of the arrow, so it is balanced. Those are the same proportions as when the reaction expression is written as in Reaction 1.1.\nAs previously noted, the numbers that appear in a reaction expression, including the implied ones, are called stoichiometric coefficients. Each unique chemical species that participates in the molecular reaction event has a corresponding stoichiometric coefficient in the reaction expression. It is important to note that the stoichiometric coefficients are taken from the reaction expression, not the reaction event. In other words, the stoichiometric coefficient of H2O in the hydrogen combustion reaction could be either one or two, depending upon which of the two reaction expressions, Reaction 1.1 or Reaction 1.2, is being used to represent the reaction event.\nThe lower-case Greek letter, \\(\\nu_{i,j}\\), is used in Reaction Engineering Basics to represent stoichiometric coefficients. The first subscript, \\(i\\), identifies the chemical species, so \\(i\\) will be a chemical formula. If more than one reaction is taking place, there will be a second subscript, \\(j\\). The subscript \\(j\\) identifies one of the reactions taking place. Typically, when solving problems, we number the reactions, in which case \\(j\\) will be a number.\nReaction Engineering Basics uses a sign convention for stoichiometric coefficients where \\(\\nu\\) for a species appearing as a reactant in the reaction expression is negative, and \\(\\nu\\) for a species that is a product in the reaction expression is positive. (See Appendix B for a complete listing of sign conventions and notation used in Reaction Engineering Basics.) Thus, the stoichiometric coefficient of H2 in Reaction 1.1 is written as \\(\\nu_{H_2,1.1}\\) and is equal to -2. If a species does not appear in the reaction expression for reaction \\(j\\), then its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction \\(j\\) is equal to zero.\nAgain, it is very important to realize and remember that the magnitude of a species’ stoichiometric coefficient is the number that preceeds it in the reaction expression. That may or may not equal the number of molecules of that species participating in the molecular reaction event. As shown here, the stoichiometric coefficients of the reagents in hydrogen combustion change, depending upon the way the reaction expression is written.\n\n\n1.1.3 Chemical Reaction Thermodynamics\nChemical reactions are processes where chemical bonds are formed and broken. Chemical bonds can be viewed as a form of stored energy. Chemical bond strength, that is, the amount of energy stored in chemical bonds, varies from bond type to bond type. As a consequence, when bonds break and form during a chemical reaction, there is a net change in the amount of energy being stored in chemical bonds. As a reaction takes place, that difference in the amount of stored energy between reactants and products is released into or extracted from the system in the form of heat. That heat is called the heat of reaction. If heat is extracted from the system, the heat of reaction is positive and the reaction is called an endothermic reaction. If heat is released into the system, the heat of reaction is negative and the reaction is called an exothermic reaction. Appendix C presents a brief review of how to calculate the heat of a given reaction.\nAll chemical reactions are bidirectional. When the rate at which reactants are being converted into products is equal to the rate at which products are being converted into reactants, the reaction is at equilibrium. At reaction equilibrium, the composition of the system is static; it does not change. Thermodynamics can be used to calculate an equilibrium constant, which, in turn can be used to calculate the composition of the system at reaction equilibrium. The equilibrium constant for a reaction changes with the system temperature. Appendix C presents a brief review of how to calculate equilibrium constants and the equilibrium composition for a reacting system.\n\n\n1.1.4 Composition of Reacting Systems\nThe systems considered so far in this chapter contained only contain enough atoms for a chemical reaction to occur one time. Systems of that size are great for the purpose of defining a chemical reaction. There were basically only two possibilities for the components of those systems. Depending upon the bonding, the system either consisted of one set of reactant molecules or it consisted of one set of product molecules. When it comes to reaction engineering or any other real-world chemical process, however, the chemical systems that need to be considered contain on the order of Avodadro’s number (6.022 x 1023) of molecules. Even if only one reaction is possible, that reaction can occur many, many times in any system of practical size. The individual molecular events do not all occur at the same time. As a consequence, the composition of the system changes over time, and means of characterizing the composition are needed.\nReaction Engineering Basics always assumes that gas phase systems are ideal. For a pure (single component) gas Equation 1.3 is the equation of state, and Equation 1.4 is the equation of state for gas mixtures.\n\\[\nPV=nRT\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\\[\nPV=RT\\sum_i n_i\n\\tag{1.4}\\]\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics, liquids are incompressible and form ideal mixtures. As such, Equation 1.5 is the equation of state for a pure liquid and Equation 1.6 is the equation of state for a liquid mixture.\n\\[\n\\rho = \\text{constant}\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\n\\[\n\\rho = \\sum_i \\left(\\omega _i \\rho _i\\right)\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nConcentration, Equation 1.7, density, Equation 1.8, mole fraction, Equation 1.9, and mass fraction, Equation 1.10, are composition variables that can be used for either gas or liquid systems.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{n_i}{V}\n\\tag{1.7}\\]\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\n\\[\nx_i = \\frac{n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i\\left(n_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.9}\\]\n\\[\n\\omega _i = \\frac{m_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i \\left(m_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.10}\\]\nThe density is related to the concentrations as shown in Equation 1.11.\n\\[\n\\rho = \\sum _i \\left( M_iC_i \\right)\n\\tag{1.11}\\]\nFor gas phase systems, the partial pressure, Equation 1.12, is another composition variable.\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{n_iRT}{V} = C_iRT\n\\tag{1.12}\\]\nIn addition to being small, the chemical systems considered up to this point were closed systems. The discussion mentioned the reagents initially present in the system. Then it continued by discussing what was present in the system at later times. Chemical reactions also take place in open systems where reagents are continually entering the system as a feed stream and leaving it as a product stream. If a chemical reaction takes place in a steady-state flow system, the starting composition is the composition of the feed stream, and the ending composition is the composition of the product stream.\nIn closed systems, the moles of each of the species are natural variables to use to describe changes in composition. In an open, steady-state system, the composition changes between the entrance or inlet of the system and the outlet, but at any one point it is constant over time. In such a system, the molar flow rates of the species are natural variables to use to describe the changes. Reaction Engineering Basics uses variable symbols with dots over them to indicate flows. For example, \\(n_i\\), denotes the moles of reagent \\(i\\) while \\(\\dot n_i\\) represents the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\). (See Appendix B for a complete listing of the notation used in Reaction Engineering Basics.) Thus, open systems are described using Equations 1.13 through 1.19 instead of Equations 1.3, 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, and 1.12.\n\\[\nP\\dot V=\\dot nRT\n\\tag{1.13}\\]\n\\[\nP\\dot V=RT\\sum_i \\dot n_i\n\\tag{1.14}\\]\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\tag{1.15}\\]\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{\\dot m}{\\dot V}\n\\tag{1.16}\\]\n\\[\nx_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i\\left(\\dot n_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.17}\\]\n\\[\n\\omega _i = \\frac{\\dot m_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum _i \\left(\\dot m_i\\right)}\n\\tag{1.18}\\]\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot n_iRT}{\\dot V} = C_iRT\n\\tag{1.19}\\]\nIn large systems, it is quite possible that the numbers of molecules of each of the different reactants are not in stoichiometric proportion. If the forward reaction were to occur a sufficient number of times, one of the reactants would be completely used up while molecules of the other reactants still remained. The reactant that is completely used up is called the limiting reactant because the net number of times the forward reaction can occur is limited by the starting number of molecules of that reactant. The limiting reactant, or reactants if more than one would run out simultaneously, can be identified if you know the number of molecules or moles of each reactant that was present initially or in the feed. As shown in Equations 1.20 (for closed systems) and 1.21 (for open systems), the initial or starting number of moles of each reactant is divided by the magnitude of its stoichiometric coefficient. The resulting values might be referred to as the “stoichiometric equivalences” of the reactants. The reactant with the smallest stoichiometric equivalence is then the limiting reactant. If the resulting value is the same for all reactants, that means that the initial composition is a stoichiometric mixture and no reactant is limiting. If a reaction had 3 reactants with two having the same stoichiometric equivalence and the third having a greater value, then either or both of the reactants with the smaller value could be considered to be the limiting reactant.\n\\[\n\\frac{n_{lr,0}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{n_{nlr,0}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|}\n\\tag{1.20}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot n_{lr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{\\dot n_{nlr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|}\n\\tag{1.21}\\]\nExample 1.4.1 shows how to use the criterion presented here to identify the limiting reactant in a given reaction system.\n\n\n1.1.5 Classifying Reactions\nThere are a number of different ways of characterizing reactions. A few have already been mentioned. One being classification based on the number of reactants participating in the molecular reaction event. That classification differentiates unimolecular, bimolecular, termolecular and intramolecular reactions. Another classification based upon the molecular reaction event is whether the reaction is elementary (all bonds break and form simultaneously) or non-elementary (the bonds break and form sequentially). From a macroscopic perspective a non-elementary reaction appears to be occurring, but at the molecular level, two or more molecular reaction events are actually taking place. The third is a thermodynamic classification based on the heat of reaction whereby reactions are classified as exothermic or endothemic.\nAnother thermodynamic classification is based upon the equilibrium composition for a reaction. All molecular reaction events are reversible. If you start with reactant molecules, they can convert to product molecules, and if you start with product molecules they can convert to reactant molecules. This is known as the principle of microscopic reversibility. As a consequence, in a large reacting system, there will always be some reactant molecules present because some of the product molecules will be reacting to re-generate reactant molecules. Eventually chemical reaction equilibrium is reached and the composition will become constant. If the amount of the limiting reactant that remains when the system reaches equilibrium is negligibly small, the reaction is said to be irreversible. In contrast, if the amount of the limiting reactant that remains when the system reaches equilibrium is appreciable, the reaction is said to be reversible. It was noted previously that double arrows (\\(\\rightleftarrows\\)) in a chemical reaction expression may signify that the reaction is reversible.\nQuite often, two or more chemical reactions take place at the same time in a chemical system. In these cases, additional classification of groups of reactions is sometimes possible. When a group of reactions all have the same reactants, but different products, that group is called a set of parallel reactions. The general form of parallel reactions is shown in Reactions 1.22. An example of parallel reactions is the chlorination of toluene, Reactions 1.23. Toluene and chlorine are the reactants in all of those reactions, but the products differ. The first reaction produces ortho-chlorotoluene, the second produces meta-chlorotoluene, and the third produces para-chlorotoluene.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\rightarrow Y \\\\\nA \\rightarrow Z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.22}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_7H_8 + Cl_2 \\rightarrow o-C_7H_7Cl + HCl \\\\\nC_7H_8 + Cl_2 \\rightarrow m-C_7H_7Cl + HCl \\\\\nC_7H_8 + Cl_2 \\rightarrow p-C_7H_7Cl + HCl\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.23}\\]\nMultiple reactions can also occur as series reactions. This means that the reactions occur sequentially, in the sense that the product of one reaction is the reactant in another reaction, as shown in Reactions 1.24, where D is the product of the first reaction and the reactant in the second reaction. In series reactions, the intermediate product, D in the case of Reactions 1.24, is often the more valuable, or desired, product, and the final product, U, is less valuable or undesired. An example of series reactions is the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene, Reactions 1.25. Cyclohexadiene is produced in the first reaction and reacts in the second reaction to yield cyclohexene. Then the cyclohexene reacts in the third reaction to produce benzene.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA \\rightarrow D \\\\\nD \\rightarrow U\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.24}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_6H_{12} \\rightarrow C_6H_{10} + H_2 \\\\\nC_6H_{10} \\rightarrow C_6H_8 + H_2 \\\\\nC_6H_8 \\rightarrow C_6H_6 + H_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.25}\\]\nA third kind of multiple reaction network involves series-parallel reactions. They are a kind of hybrid of series reactions and parallel reactions. From the perspective of one reactant, the group of reactions appear to be series reactions while from the perspective of the other reactant, it appears to be a parallel reaction network. Looking at the general example in Reactions 1.26, D is a product of the first reaction and it is a reactant in the second reaction. At the same time, B is a reactant in both reactions. So from the perspective of A being converted to D which is subsequently converted to U, it looks like a series reaction network but from B’s perspective it looks like a parallel reaction network. Reactions 1.27 is an example of a three-reaction series-parallel network. Methane is converted in parallel, while mono-methyl, di-methyl- and tri-methylamine are generated sequentially.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nA + B \\rightarrow D + Y \\\\\nD + B \\rightarrow U + Z\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.26}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nNH_3 + CH_4 \\rightarrow NH_2CH_3 + H_2 \\\\\nNH_2CH_3 + CH_4 \\rightarrow NH\\left(CH_3\\right)_2 + H_2 \\\\\nNH\\left(CH_3\\right)_2 + CH_4 \\rightarrow N\\left(CH_3\\right)_3 + H_2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.27}\\]\nPolymerization reactions are another type of multiple reaction network. Whole books and whole courses are devoted to polymerization reactions, so there’s lots more to it that what’s presented here. For present purposes, it can be noted that polymerization reactions share some of the characteristics of series-parallel reactions. In a simple example, Reactions 1.28, one reactant participates in parallel. It is called the monomer, and is represented here as M. The difference is that there may be thousands of sequential reactions. As a consequence, there are many, many products, differing in the number of monomer units they were made from. There isn’t one desired product, but often the goal is to produce predominantly products where the value of \\(n\\) falls in a certain range. Ethylene polymerization to produce polyethylene, Reaction 1.29, is an example of a polymerization reaction.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM + M \\rightarrow M_2 \\\\\nM + M_2 \\rightarrow M_3 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nM + M_{n-1} \\rightarrow M_n\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1.28}\\]\n\\[\nn C_2H_4 \\rightarrow \\; -\\left(CH_2-CH_2\\right)_n-\n\\tag{1.29}\\]"

    "text": "1.2 Chemical Reactors\nDefining a chemical system involves identifying or specifying physical boundaries and describing chemical events that happen within those boundaries. In Reaction Engineering Basics the boundaries typically will encompass chemical process equipment, and chemical reactions will be among the events occurring within those boundaries. The term reactor often refers to a physical container, such as a flask, beaker, tank, pipe, etc., within which one or more chemical reactions occur. In that case, the physical walls of the reactor define the boundaries of the chemical system.\nA reactor does not have to be a piece of apparatus, though. The human liver can be modeled as a chemical reactor . Neither does it have to possess physical walls. The earth’s atmosphere can be modeled as a chemical reactor. Many of the principles presented in this book can be used in the development of models for systems like the human liver (Mitchell and Mendes 2013) and the earth’s atmosphere(Yang, Lu, and Hu 2013). Nonetheless, the reactors considered in Reaction Engineering Basics will be physical containers in almost all cases. When biological reactions take place within them, the name chemostat or fermentor is sometimes used instead of “reactor.”\nTwo types of reactors are the primary focus of Reaction Engineering Basics. One is a vessel wherein the contents are perfectly mixed. These are commonly referred to as stirred tank reactors. Stirred tank reactors may be open (that is have material flowing in and/or out) or they may be closed with no material flow in or out. The other type of reactor is a cylindrical tube within which the fluid velocity is constant across the tube diameter. Flow of that type is commonly called plug flow, and the reactors are called plug flow reactors.\nReaction Engineering Basics examines ideal stirred tank reactors. The most important feature of ideal stirred tank reactors is that the contents are perfectly mixed at all times. If the contents of an ideal stirred tank reactor are sampled simutaneously at multiple locations within the stirred tank, the temperature, pressure and composition of every sample will be the same. Figure 1.3 presents a schematic representation of a closed stirred tank reactor that exchanges heat with an external heat exchange fluid. Chapter 6 describes three variants of stirred tank reactors (batch, semi-batch and continuous) and Appendix G derives equations used to model them. The volume containing the reacting fluid and the volume containing the heat exchange fluid are separated by a wall through which the fluids exchange heat. In Reaction Engineering Basics the heat exchange fluid is always assumed to be perfectly mixed, and the heat exchange fluid is assumed to exchange either sensible heat or latent heat, but not both. Appendix D describes heat exchange with stirred tanks in a little more detail and also presents equations used to model it.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A closed (batch) stirred tank reactor. The reacting fluid is represented by the turquoise shading and the heat exchange fluid by yellow shading. The wall through which heat is exchanged is shaded red.\n\n\nThe ideal tubular reactors considered in Reaction Engineering Basics are always assumed to be cylindrical with a constant diameter. The fluid in an ideal tubular reactor is assumed to display plug flow. Figure 1.4 shows a schematic representation of a tubular reactor with heat exchange. Unlike stirred tanks, the temperature, pressure and composition change along the length of a plug-flow reactor. The same assumptions about perfect mixing of the heat exchange fluid and exchange of either sensible heat or latent* heat by that fluid are used. The wall through which heat is exchanged is always the wall of the tubular reactor. Equations for modeling plug-flow reactors are derived in Appendix G, and equations for modeling tubular reactor heat exchange are presented in Appendix D.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: A plug-flow reactor. The reacting fluid is represented by blue shading. The gradient in the shading indicates that the temperature, pressure and composition change along the length of the cylindrical reactor. Heat can be exchanged through the wall of the reactor which is shaded in red. The perfectly mixed heat exchange fluid is represented by yellow shading.\n\n\nChemical processes, and, by extension, chemical reactors, can be classified in a few ways. One form of classification is based upon whether the reactor exchanges heat with its surroundings. If no energy is added to or removed from the reactor other that that associated with input and output flow streams, the reactor is said to be adiabatic. If energy is added or removed, the process is non-adiabatic.\nAnother form of classification is based upon variables describing the process being constant. If the temperature is uniform (the same everywhere) throughout the reactor and constant while the process occurs, the process is said to be isothermal. Similarly, if the pressure throughout the reactor is uniform and constant while the process occurs, the reactor is said to be isobaric. A process is isochoric if the system volume is constant while the process occurs.\nA third form of classification is based upon temporal (time) variations. If, at each location within the reactor, the temperature, pressure and composition are constant over time, the reactor is said to operate at steady-state. In a steady-state reactor, the temperature, pressure and composition may vary from location to location within the reactor, but at each location they are constant over time. If the temperature, pressure or composition vary over time at any location with a reactor, then it is called transient operation."

    "text": "1.3 Reaction Engineering\nReaction engineering is an important, exciting and engaging field of study. It is important because it is used to produce many, many things we use every day (fuels, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, processed foods, plastics, computer chips, etc.). It is exciting because it is expected to play a major role in meeting several of the grand challenges facing mankind (“NAE GRAND CHALLENGES FOR ENGINEERING” 2017). Specifically, there is a role for reaction engineering in making solar energy economical, developing carbon sequestration methods, managing the nitrogen cycle, providing access to clean water, and perhaps also in some aspects of providing energy from fusion, engineering better medicines, and engineering the tools of scientific discovery. It is not only engaging because reaction engineers can work to solve important, meaningful problems, but also because practitioners can be highly creative when solving reaction engineering problems.\nChemical reaction engineering is a sub-discipline of chemical engineering that focuses upon processes involving one or more chemical reactions. It incorporates the modeling, optimization, design and operation of chemical reactors. That modeling involves the integration of fluid flow, mass and heat transfer and chemical reaction kinetics to mathematically describe reactor systems.\nReaction engineering models allow reaction engineers and others to understand reaction processes and predict their behavior before investing time and money in building them. The models reveal necessary equipment size, energy requirements, wastes that are co-produced, and so on. Using them, the procedures for safely starting, operating and shutting down processes can be specified. The models can also be used to calculate the economics of building and operating processes.\nReaction engineers must be creative and need skills beyond building models. They must be able to create new processes and adapt existing processes to make new products while satisfying safety, environmental and economic constraints. Reaction engineers must be able to locate or generate data required by their models and they need the ability to validate and revise their models using experimental data. Reaction engineers must function effectively as members of multidisciplinary teams that include experts in business, finance, health, safety, environmental and regulatory compliance, logistics, operations, chemistry and others.\nReaction Engineering Basics offers an introduction to reaction engineering. While it is limited in scope, it illustrates many of the kinds of problems that reaction engineers encounter. Chemical kinetics is a sub-discipline of chemistry that focuses upon the rates of chemical reactions. Reaction Engineering Basics introduces essential aspects of chemical kinetics, in particular, the generation and analysis of data for the purpose of generating rate expressions for chemical reactions. Appendix A presents an overview of knowledge that readers of Reaction Engineering Basics are expected to possess. Solving reaction engineering models requires knowledge from the field of mathematics. Reaction Engineering Basics assumes model equations will be solved numerically. Appendices H through L present an overview of numerical methods that are commonly used to solve reaction engineering model equations."

If equal volumes of carbon monoxide and air at equal temperature and pressure are mixed and flow into a chemical reactor, which reactant is limiting?\n\\[\n2 CO + O_2 \\rightarrow 2 CO_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What Might an Expert be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem asks me to identify the limiting reactant, and that means that I will need to use either Equation 1.20 or Equation 1.21. It also states that CO and air flow into the reactor. That means it is an open reactor, and Equation 1.21 should be used to identify the limiting reactant. The reactants and their stoichiometric coefficients can be determined from the balanced chemical reaction which is given as reaction (1).\n\n\n\nLimiting Reactant Criterion\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot n_{lr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{\\dot n_{nlr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nReactants: CO and O2\nStoichiometric Coefficients of the Reactants: \\(\\nu_{CO} = -2\\) and \\(\\nu_{O_2} = -1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem does not give me enough information to calculate the inlet molar flow rates. However, since it doesn’t give any extensive quantities, I can assume the inlet volumetric flow rate of CO or air as a basis. (According to the problem statement they are equal.) I still can’t calculate the inlet molar flow rates, though, because I don’t know the temperature or pressure. However, I do know that the gases are ideal, so I can try re-writing equation (2) in terms of volumetric flow rates.\n\n\n\nUsing the ideal gas law the molar flow rates in equation (2) can be expressed in terms of the volumetric flow rates.\n\\[\n\\frac{P\\dot V_{lr,in}}{RT\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|}&lt; \\frac{P\\dot V_{nlr,in}}{RT\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|}\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(\\frac{RT}{P}\\) yields a limiting reactant criterion in terms of inlet volumetric flow rates, equation (3).\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot V_{lr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{lr} \\right|} &lt; \\frac{\\dot V_{nlr,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{nlr} \\right|} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nBasis: \\(\\dot V_{CO,in}\\) = 1 L s-1.\nAccording to the problem statement the inlet volumetric flow rates of air and CO are equal, so \\(\\dot V_{\\text{air},in}\\) = 1 L s-1.\nAssuming that air is 21% O2 and 79% other non-reactive gases (predominantly N2) allows calculation of the inlet volumetric flow rate of O2, equation (4). At that point the stoichiometric equivalences of CO and O2 can be calculated, equations (5) and (6).\n\\[\n\\dot V_{O_2,in} = 0.21 \\dot V_{\\text{air},in} = 0.21 \\text{ L s}^{-1} \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot V_{CO,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{CO} \\right|} = \\frac{1 \\text{ L s}^{-1}}{\\left|-2\\right|} = 0.5 \\text{ L s}^{-1} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\dot V_{O_2,in}}{\\left| \\nu_{O_2} \\right|} = \\frac{0.21 \\text{ L s}^{-1}}{\\left|-1\\right|} = 0.21 \\text{ L s}^{-1} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric equivalence of O2 is smaller than that of CO, so O2 is the limiting reactant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are other ways to solve this problem. In the solution presented here, the volumetric flow rate of CO was chosen as a basis for the calculations. An alternative approach would be to choose the molar flow rate of air or CO as a basis. Doing so is left as an exercise for the reader."

    "title": "2  Reaction Engineering Ethics and Safety",
    "section": "2.1 Ethics",
    "text": "2.1 Ethics\nMost engineering professional societies and many engineering schools have set forth codes of ethics, and many of the professionals who practice reaction engineering are members of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). The AIChE Code of Ethics (American Institute of Chemical Engineers 2012) is as follows.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers adopted this Code of Ethics to which it expects that the professional conduct of its members shall conform, and to which every applicant attests by signing his or her membership application. Members of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers shall uphold and advance the integrity, honor and dignity of the engineering profession by: being honest and impartial and serving with fidelity their employers, their clients, and the public; striving to increase the competence and prestige of the engineering profession; and using their knowledge and skill for the enhancement of human welfare. To achieve these goals, members shall:\n1. Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and protect the environment in performance of their professional duties.\n2. Formally advise their employers or clients (and consider further disclosure, if warranted) if they perceive that a consequence of their duties will adversely affect the present or future health or safety of their colleagues or the public.\n3. Accept responsibility for their actions, seek and heed critical review of their work and offer objective criticism of the work of others.\n4. Issue statements or present information only in an objective and truthful manner.\n5. Act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees, avoiding conflicts of interest and never breaching confidentiality.\n6. Treat all colleagues and co-workers fairly and respectfully, recognizing their unique contributions and capabilities by fostering an environment of equity, diversity and inclusion.\n7. Perform professional services only in areas of their competence.\n8. Build their professional reputations on the merits of their services.\n9. Continue their professional development throughout their careers, and provide opportunities for the professional development of those under their supervision.\n10. Never tolerate harassment.\n11. Conduct themselves in a fair, honorable and respectful manner.\n\nAll 11 expectations of the AIChE Code of Ethics are important. A few of them are particularly relevant for reaction engineers. Holding paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and protecting the environment is discussed later in this chapter. The second tenet, advising employers if you think your work can affect others’ health or safety is essential. As an example, suppose a process you are operating produces an aqueous toxic waste stream. That waste stream is purified, and the resulting purified water is discharged into a stream. If you learn that the purification system has not been operating properly and, consequently, contaminated water has been discharged into the stream, it is essential that you report this to your employer. If your employer takes no action, you should consider further disclosure.\nThe seventh and ninth expectations can also be relevant. This book presents an introduction to reaction engineering. There are many aspects of the field that it does not touch upon. If you intend to pursue reaction engineering as a career, there is much more you need to learn. You should continue to build your reaction engineering competence. Until you have learned more, you should not attempt engage in reaction engineering of systems that do not conform to the assumptions used in this book.\nThis book is not about ethics, or even reaction engineering ethics. Nonetheless, this chapter has been included because every engineer should be aware of codes of ethics that have been developed for their field. Before you are confronted with an issue of ethics, it is useful to know what you should do, and to have thought about and committed to responding in an ethical manner. Establishing personal principles of ethical behavior now, and sticking with them in small matters, will be beneficial should larger ethical issues arise in the future."

    "section": "2.2 Safety",
    "text": "2.2 Safety\nAccording to the AIChE Code of Ethics the most important ethical responsibilities (the one to be held paramount) are the safety, health and welfare of people and the protection of the environment. Reactive chemical processes present risk with respect to all of these responsibilities. While not intended nor desired, explosions and release of toxic chemicals can occur resulting in deaths, injury, property damage and environmental contamination. Reaction engineers must always be aware of such possibilities and must do all they can to prevent them.\nMuch can be learned from the U. S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB), a federal agency that investigates industrial chemical accidents (“U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board  CSB” n.d.). As an example, “CSB Safety Video: Reactive Hazards” (U. S. Chemical Safety Board n.d.) describes four chemical reaction accidents. In addition to describing how and why the accident occurred, the video offers a number of safety recommendations related to reactive processes.\nThe first accident was the result of a change in process operation. It involved the highly exothermic polymerization of an acrylic polymer. The company had operated the process safely for years in batches of fixed size. An order was received for an amount of polymer 12% greater than the standard batch size. When the company attempted to manufacture the requested amount in a single batch, the cooling system was unable to remove the generated heat, and the reactor exploded. One person died and 14 others were injured.\nA twelve percent increase does not seem excessive. Nonetheless, it should not have been assumed that the batch size could be increased by 12% without affecting the process. Ethics would dictate that the consequences of this change should have been thoroughly investigated before making a decision to increase the batch size.\nThe second accident was the indirect result of an equipment failure. A polymerization reactor was used to produce hot polymer being fed to an extruder. During start-up, the extruder failed and the hot polymer was diverted to a storage tank. Too much time was spent trying to fix the extruder, so that the storage tank was overfilled. The excess polymer blocked the pressure gauge and the vent. As a result, workers did not know that the tank was under high pressure, and when they attempted to unbolt the cover, it blew off. As it blew off, the cover broke pipes, resulting in a fire. Three workers were killed.\nThe third accident was the result of improper scale-up of a chemical reactor. A reaction had been studied and operated safely in a 30 gallon test reactor. When the company scaled up to a 4000 gallon production reactor, they failed to realize that additional cooling was necessary. The production reactor exploded and released toxic chemicals into the air. Two hundred families living nearby had to be evacuated. One hundred fifty-four people had to be treated due to exposure to the chemicals.\nThe last example involved a leaking valve that the operators believed to be closed. Ultimately this resulted in a explosion that threw a 35 foot section of a tower completely off the chemical site. Another chunk of the tower hit a storage tank setting it ablaze. Shrapnel landed close to nearby tanks, one containing crude oil and the other, anhydrous ammonia. Had any shrapnel hit those tanks, the effects would have been even more dire.\nThese accidents have been described here to drive home the point that the highest ethical standards must be used when dealing with reactive processes. None of these accidents were desired nor expected. Some were caused by human error and others by a combination of equipment failure and not anticipating and planning for potential disruption of process conditions.\nThe CSB video (U. S. Chemical Safety Board n.d.) gives a number of recommendations that are worth repeating here. They apply equally to large industrial facilities and to small research laboratories.\n\nThose responsible for a chemical process must have a thorough understanding of the chemistry under designed operating conditions and under all foreseeable abnormal conditions. Multiple sources of information on chemical processes should be consulted and specialized testing should be conducted, if necessary, before operating reactive processes. Indeed, the CSB found that over 90% of serious accidents involve hazards that have already been described in publicly available literature.\nDetailed operating procedures should be developed and training programs to teach those procedures should be implemented. Potential hazards must be communicated to anyone associated with the operation or maintenance of reactive processes. Appropriate pressure relief and other safeguards need to be designed into the process.\nThe effects of even small changes to process conditions should be thoroughly studied before they are implemented, and the implementation of any changes must be carefully managed.\nFacilities need to plan for possible accidents, including evacuation drills and emergency response exercises. There should be well-rehearsed evacuation plans for facilities where reactive chemical processes operate. There should also be regular emergency response exercises. When appropriate, local law enforcement, firefighters and other first responders should be involved in such exercises.\n\nAs with the preceding section on ethics, the safety information presented here barely scratches the surface. Hopefully it is sufficient to have created an awareness of the importance of incorporating safety in every aspect of reaction engineering.\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers. 2012. “Code of Ethics.” https://www.aiche.org/about/governance/policies/code-ethics.\n\n\nU.

Dividing both sides of the equation by Avogadro’s number, \\(N_{Av}\\), and rearranging, gives an expression for the moles of \\(i\\) at any later time, given the number of moles of \\(i\\) at the start of the process.\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\nu _{i,j} \\frac{N_{j,net}}{N_{Av}}\n\\]\nThe net number of reaction events divided by Avogadro’s number is called the true extent of reaction j, \\(\\Xi_j\\), Equation 3.1. Substitution in the preceding equation yields an expression for the moles of \\(i\\), Equation 3.2.\n\\[\n\\Xi_j = \\frac{N_{j,net}}{N_{Av}}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\nu _{i,j} \\Xi_j\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nThat was for a closed system. For an open, steady-state system, the change occurs between the point where the moles enter the process and the point where they leave. When talking about material entering and leaving, it makes more sense to use molar flow rates instead of moles. Doing so leads to Equation 3.3 for an open, steady-state system. It turns out that these equations are accurate no matter how the reaction expression is written, as long as it is balanced. That is, the stoichiometric coefficients in the reaction expression do not have to equal the number of molecules that participate in the molecular reaction event, but the reaction expression does have to be properly balanced. In that case, it is preferable to define the apparent extent of reaction, \\(\\xi_j\\), as the net number of times the reaction, as written, occurs and to use the apparent extent of reaction in Equation 3.1 and Equation 3.2 instead of the true extent of reaction. Uses of the apparent extent of reaction are illustrated in Examples 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, and 3.4.4.\n\\[\n\\dot n_i = \\dot n_{i,0} + \\nu _i \\dot \\Xi_j\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nIt’s also important to know that the extent of reaction is an extensive quantity. For a closed system it has units of moles, and for an open, steady-state system it has units of moles per time. In the latter case, the extent is related to the net number of times that the molecular reaction event occurs per unit time. Notice that all of the variable symbols in Equation 3.3 except the stoichiometric coefficient have dots over them, indicating they are flow quantities.\nThere’s a second quantity that is very useful for describing how far a reaction has progressed. It’s called the conversion. It can be either a fraction or a percentage, and it only applies to reactants. Quite simply, the fractional conversion of reactant \\(i\\), denoted as \\(f_i\\), is just the fraction of the starting amount of \\(i\\) that has reacted. It is an intensive quantity, and it does not have any units. The defining equations for closed and open, steady state systems are shown in Equation 3.4 and Equation 3.5. It doesn’t make sense to talk about how much product was converted, so again, conversion only applies to reactants.\n\\[\nf_i=\\frac{n_{i,0}-n_i}{n_{i,0}}\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\n\\[\nf_i=\\frac{\\dot{n}_{i,in}-\\dot{n}_i}{\\dot{n}_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) is a reactant.\nIf the starting composition is stoichiometric, then the fractional conversion of every reactant will be the same. However, if one reactant is present in excess, its fractional conversion will be smaller than other reactants and will never reach 100%. For this reason, when the starting composition is not stoichiometric, it is preferred (but not required) that the conversion be specified for the limiting reactant because then the conversion will range from zero to 100%, assuming the reaction is irreversible. Of course, if the reaction is reversible, then even the limiting reactant will have a maximum conversion that is less than 100% because the system will reach equilibrium with measurable amounts of the reactants still remaining. The use of fractional conversion is illustrated in Example 3.4.1 and Example 3.4.4.\nIf it is desired to have a conversion that always ranges from 0 to 100%, the fraction of equilibrium conversion, Equation 3.6 for a closed system or Equation 3.7 for an open, steady-state system, can be used. The fraction of equilibrium conversion, \\(g_i\\) is just the actual conversion relative to the conversion at equilibrium, so it, too, is an intensive variable. The vertical bar in these equations means “evaluated at”, and “eq” is shorthand for equilibrium, so together the vertical bar followed by a subscripted “eq” means the quantity it follows is evaluated at equilibrium. (See Appendix B for a complete list of the sign conventions and notation used in Reaction Engineering Basics.)\n\\[\ng_i = \\frac{f_i}{f_{i,eq}}= \\frac{\\frac{n_{i,0} - n_i}{n_{i,0}}}{\\frac{n_{i,0} -  n_{i,eq}}{n_{i,0}}} = \\frac{n_{i,0} - n_i}{n_{i,0} - n_{i,eq}}\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\n\\[\ng_i = \\frac{\\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i}{\\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_{i,eq}}\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) is a reactant.\nThe fraction of equilibrium conversion may not be convenient to use. For one thing, in order to use it, you have to do additional calculations to determine what the conversion is at equilibrium. In addition, the conversion at equilibrium changes with temperature which means a change in temperature would change the fraction of equilibrium conversion even if no reaction took place."

    "section": "3.2 Describing Multiple-Reaction Systems",
    "text": "3.2 Describing Multiple-Reaction Systems\nThe preceding section considered systems where only one reaction was taking place. When multiple reactions are taking place in the system, additional or different variables are needed to fully describe the reacting system. Before considering such variables it is necessary to review what is meant by “mathematically independent” equations, or in this case, mathematically independent reactions.\nTo understand why, consider Reactions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. Only two of those three reactions are mathematically independent. The third is a linear combination of the others. This can be seen by noting, for example, that the third reaction is the sum of the first two. Put differently, the third reaction is equal to the net effect of the first two reactions occurring sequentially.\n\\[\nCO + 3 H_2 \\rightarrow CH_4 + H_2O\n\\tag{3.8}\\]\n\\[\nCO + H_2O \\rightarrow CO_2 + H_2\n\\tag{3.9}\\]\n\\[\n2 CO + 2 H_2 \\rightarrow CH_4 + CO_2\n\\tag{3.10}\\]\nIf a system initially contained a mixture of CO and H2, and then at some later time it was found to contain CO, H2, CH4, H2O and CO2, it would not be possible to know how much of the CH4 was produced by Reaction 3.8 and how much was produced by Reaction 3.10. Similarly, it would not be possible to know how much of the CO2 had been produced by Reaction 3.9 and how much was produced by Reaction 3.10. It is impossible to calculate the true extents of all three reactions if only the initial and final compositions of the system are known.\nIn general, when some of the reactions occurring in a system are linear combinations of other reactions, then a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions captures all of the stoichiometry. A complete mathematically independent subset is a group of reactions taken from all possible reactions where (1) none of the reactions in the subset are a linear combination of other reactions in the subset, and (2) each reaction that is not in the subset is a linear combination of the reactions that are in the subset. Consequently, for a closed system, the change in the number of moles of any reagent, \\(i\\), is equal to the sum of the apparent extents, \\(\\xi _{j^\\prime}\\) of the \\(j^{\\prime}\\) mathematically independent reactions multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficient, \\(\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}\\), of reagent \\(i\\) in independent reaction \\(j^{\\prime}\\). This leads to Equation 3.11 for a closed system or to Equation 3.12 for an open, steady-state system. In those equations \\(j^{\\prime}\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place in the system. Note that Equation 3.11 and Equation 3.12 also apply to a system where only one reaction is taking place. In that case, the summation reduces to a single term. Example 3.4.3 illustrates the identification of a complete mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place in a system, and Example 3.4.4 illustrates the use of the apparent extents of those reactions in the calculation of system composition.\n\\[\n\\Delta n_i = n_i - n_{i,0} = \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{3.11}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_i = \\dot n_{i,in} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\dot \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{3.12}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system.\nIt is important to recognize that the extent of reaction, \\(\\Xi_j\\), has physical significance. It is the number times that molecular reaction event \\(j\\) has occurred, expressed in moles. In contrast, the apparent extent of reaction, \\(\\xi_{j^\\prime}\\), does not have any physical significance. It is a mathematical construct that is useful for characterizing the composition of a reacting system. Indeed, for a given multiple reaction system, there are typically more than one complete, mathematically independent subsets, and any one of those subsets can be used in Equation 3.11 or Equation 3.12.\nIn order to use Equation 3.11 or Equation 3.12 it is necessary to determine the number of mathematically independent reactions and then to find at least one such subset. Appendix A presents a very brief and succinct description of how to do this, and Example 3.4.3 illustrates doing so.\nIf the number of mathematically independent reactions is \\(N\\), then \\(N\\) reaction progress variables are needed to fully characterize the system, given its initial composition. Thus, the apparent extents of a complete, mathematically independent subset of all possible reactions are sufficient to calculate the composition of a system, given its initial composition.\nThe conversion can be used when describing reaction progress of multiple reaction systems, but it must be used in conjunction with additional measures of reaction progress to fully specify the system composition. When using the conversion as a reaction progress variable in a multiple reaction system, it is necessary to specify the reactant it applies to. Furthermore, that reactant must be initially present in the system. As an example, again consider Reactions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10. H2O is a reactant in Reaction 3.9, but it might not initially be present in the system. Initially the system might only contain CO and H2. H2O would be generated by Reaction 3.8 and then could participate as a reactant in Reaction 3.9. If one tried to calculate the conversion of H2O using Equation 3.4, the denominator would equal zero, leading to an infinite conversion. Therefore when multiple reactions are taking place, conversion is only defined for reactants that are initially present.\nYield is a reaction progress variable that specifies the amount of one particular product relative to the starting amount of one particular reactant. There are a few different ways to define yield, making it important to know which definition is being used whenever a yield is specified. When multiple reactions are occurring, it is very often true that some of the products are more desirable or valuable than other products. In some such systems, the desired product, \\(D\\), is produced through a combination of reaction steps where it isn’t possible to identify a stoichiometric relationship between \\(D\\) and any one reactant, \\(i\\). Under these circumstances it is common to define the yield as shown in Equation 3.13 for a closed system and in Equation 3.14 for an open, steady-state process. Example 3.4.4 illustrates the use of yield as a reaction progress variable.\n\\[\nY_{D/i} = \\frac{n_D}{n_{i,0}}\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\n\\[\nY_{D/i} = \\frac{\\dot n_D}{\\dot n_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.14}\\]\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) where \\(D\\) is a product and \\(i\\) is a reactant.\nIn other reaction systems, the desired product, \\(D\\), is produced from reactant, \\(i\\), in only one reaction, \\(j\\). When this is true, it may be preferable to account for the stoichiometry as shown in Equation 3.15 and Equation 3.16. By doing so, the resulting yield can be expressed as a percentage that ranges from 0 to 100% (assuming reaction \\(j\\) is irreversible).\n\\[\nY^\\prime_{D/i} = \\frac{\\nu_{i,j}}{\\nu_{D,j}}\\frac{n_D}{n_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.15}\\]\n\\[\nY^\\prime_{D/i} = \\frac{\\nu_{i,j}}{\\nu_{D,j}}\\frac{\\dot n_D}{\\dot n_{i,in}}\n\\tag{3.16}\\]\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) where \\(D\\) is a product and \\(i\\) is a reactant.\nWhile yield relates the amount of a product to the amount of a reactant, selectivity is a reaction progress variable that relates the amount of one product or group of products to a different product or group of products. If there is one desirable product, \\(D\\), and one undesirable product, \\(U\\), the selectivity for \\(D\\) relative to \\(U\\) can be defined as shown in Equation 3.17 and Equation 3.18. In other instances the selectivity of interest might involve groups of products. Examples include parafins vs. olefins, napthenes vs. aromatics or hydrocarbons with 6 or more carbon atoms (sometimes denotes as C6+) vs. hydrocarbons with 5 or fewer carbon atoms (sometimes denoted as C5-). Example 3.4.1 and Example 3.4.4 illustrate the use of selectivity.\n\\[\nS_{D/U} = \\frac{n_D}{n_U}\n\\tag{3.17}\\]\n\\[\nS_{D/U} = \\frac{\\dot n_D}{\\dot n_U}\n\\tag{3.18}\\]\nBoth yield and selectivity can be used as overall measures or as instantaneous measures. The overall yield or selectivity is the value at the end of a closed process or at the outlet from an open, steady-state process, as defined in Equations 3.17 and 3.18. In a closed process, the yield or selectivity will typically change over time, and in an open, steady-state process it will vary with position within the reactor. An instantaneous yield or selectivity can be defined for that time or position within the reactor. The instantaneous yield or selectivity is related to the rates at which the amounts of the reagents are changing. Reaction rates are defined in Chapter 4, so defining equations for the instantaneous yield or selectivity will be presented in that chapter."

Mole tables can be particularly helpful for those just learning reaction engineering. They are useful when calculating the composition of a system, given its initial composition, and also when converting from one composition variable (concentration, mole fraction, partial pressure, moles, etc.) to another.\nA mole table has three columns, as can be seen in Table 3.1. The first column lists each of the chemical species that are present in the system, including any inert reagents that do not participate in any chemical reactions. The second column lists the initial moles (for a closed system) or inlet molar flow rate (for an open, steady-state system) of each species. The third column lists expressions for the moles or molar flow rates at any later time or at any point beyond the inlet to an open system in terms of the apparent extents of reaction. In other words, each row in the third column contains either Equation 3.11 or Equation 3.12 for that row’s species, with the summation expanded and the values of the stoichiometric coefficients substituted.

Reaction (2) also takes place at the operating conditions of 1 atm and 150 °C. The process starts with 90% ethane and 10% air (you may take air to contain 79% N2 and 21% O2) and ends with a 50% conversion of O2 and a selectivity of 3 C2H4/CO2. Construct a mole table for this system and use it to calculate the final mole fraction of CO2.\n\\[\n2 C_2H_6 + O_2 \\leftrightarrows 2 C_2H_4 + 2 H_2O \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 C_2H_6 + 7 O_2 \\leftrightarrows 4 CO_2 + 6 H_2O \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this problem asks me to do is something that is often done as one step in the completion of a reaction engineering assigment. The completion of reaction engineering assignments often requires the calculation of the composition of a system given information about its initial composition together with some measure of how much reaction has taken place. I often refer to this kind of task as a reaction progress task.\nAlmost inevitably, the completion of a reaction progress task entails first using the given information about the initial composition to calculate the initial molar amounts (for closed systems) or inlet molar flow rates (for open, steady-state systems) of every reagent present in the system. The next step involves using these initial amounts and the given measure of reaction progress to calculate the apparent extent of reaction. The amounts of all of the reagents corresponding to the given measure of reaction progress then can be calculated using the known initial composition and the apparent extent of reaction. Finally the desired quantities, e. g. concentrations, mole fractions, partial pressures, etc., corresponding to the given measure of reaction progress can be calculated using their defining equations.\nI like to begin by summarizing the information provided in the problem statement. As I started to do so, I noticed that the system initially contains 10% air. Multiplying that 10% by the fraction of O2 found in air (21%), gives the mole fraction of O2. The same is true for N2, except its fraction in air is 79%.\n\n\n\nGiven: \\(P = 1 \\text{ atm}\\), \\(T = 150 \\text{ °C}\\), \\(f_{O_2} = 0.5\\), \\(S_{C_2H_4/CO_2} = 3.0\\)\nGiven Initial Composition: \\(y_{C_2H_6,0}\\) = 0.9, \\(y_{O_2,0}\\) = 0.21(0.1), \\(y_{N_2,0}\\) = 0.79(0.1)\nRequested: \\(y_{CO_2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nA mole table can be a useful tool when performing reaction progress tasks, particularly when one is just beginning to study reaction engineering. This problem tells me to construct a mole table, so I’ll do that first. I know that when I construct a mole table, I’ll need to use Equation 3.11. I also know that to use Equation 3.11, I need to identify a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions that are taking place. Since there are only two reactions taking place in this problem, I can do that by inspection. The reactions produce different products, so there is no way that one can be a simple multiple of the other, and therefore reactions (1) and (2) are mathematically independent. Consequently, in Equation 3.11, \\(j^\\prime\\) will range from 1 to 2.\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad n_{i,0} + \\nu_{i,1} \\xi_1 + \\nu_{i,2} \\xi_2\n\\]\nWith that knowledge, I can construct the mole table. There are six reagents in this system: C2H6, O2, C2H4, H2O, CO2, and N2. The first column of the mole table lists one of these species in each row. A row is added at the bottom listing “Total.” The second column lists variables representing the initial molar amounts of each reagent. I can use \\(n_{\\text{total},0}\\) to represent \\(n_{C_2H_6,0}\\) + \\(n_{O_2,0}\\) + \\(n_{C_2H_4,0}\\) + \\(n_{H_2O,0}\\) + \\(n_{CO_2,0}\\) + \\(n_{N_2,0}\\).\nThe equation above can then be used to construct the entries in each row of the third column of the mole table. For example, the stoichiometric coefficient of C2H6 in reaction (1), \\(\\nu_{C_2H_6,1}\\), is -2, and its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction (2), \\(\\nu_{C_2H_6,2}\\), is also equal to -2. Letting \\(i\\) equal C2H6, substituting these values, and expanding the summation yields an expression for the moles of C2H6 at any later time.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn_{C_2H_6} &= n_{C_2H_6,0} + \\nu_{C_2H_6,1} \\xi_1 + \\nu_{C_2H_6,2} \\xi_2 \\\\\n&= n_{C_2H_6,0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 2 \\xi_2\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nIn a similar manner, the rows in the third column corresponding to each of the species are completed. For the last row, the expressions in all the other rows are simply added together to complete the mole table.\n\n\n\nA mole table for this system is presented in Table 3.1.\n\n\nTable 3.1: Mole Table for Example 3.4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nInitial Amount\nLater Amount\n\n\n\n\nC2H6\n\\(n_{C_2H_6,0}\\)\n\\(n_{C_2H_6,0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 2 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nO2\n\\(n_{O_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{O_2,0} - \\xi_1 - 7 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nC2H4\n\\(n_{C_2H_4,0}\\)\n\\(n_{C_2H_4,0} + 2 \\xi_1\\)\n\n\nH2O\n\\(n_{H_2O,0}\\)\n\\(n_{H_2O,0} + 2 \\xi_1 + 6 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nCO2\n\\(n_{CO_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CO_2,0} + 4 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nN2\n\\(n_{N_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{N_2,0}\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0}\\)\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0} + \\xi_1 + \\xi_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem directs me to use Table 3.1 to calculate the final mole fraction of CO2. Looking at the mole table and at the given information, I can see that there is no way to calculate the initial molar amounts that appear in the mole table. However, quantity that is provided in the problem statement is an intensive quantity. When no extensive quantities are provided, I can assume the value of any one extensive quantity and use it as the basis for my calculations. Since the initial mole fractions are given, it makes sense to choose the total moles initially present in the system as a basis.\n\n\n\nBasis: \\(n_{\\text{total},0} = 1 \\text{ mol}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I noted above, the first step in completing a reacton progress task is to calculate the initial molar amounts. Having chosen a basis, this is straightforward. The initial percentages of ethane (90%) and air (10%) add up to 100%, meaning that there was no C2H4, H2O, or CO2 initially present. The total initial moles can then be calculated.\n\n\n\nNecessary Equations\n\\[\nn_{C_2H_6,0} = y_{C_2H_6,0} n_{\\text{total},0} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{O_2,0} = y_{O_2,0} n_{\\text{total},0} \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{N_2,0} = y_{N_2,0} n_{\\text{total},0} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{C_2H_4,0} = n_{H_2O,0} = n_{CO_2,0} = 0 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{\\text{total},0} = n_{C_2H_6,0} + n_{O_2,0} + n_{C_2H_4,0} + n_{H_2O,0} + n_{CO_2,0} + n_{N_2,0} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second step in completing a reacton progress task is using these initial amounts and the given measures of reaction progress to calculate the apparent extents of reaction. In this problem there are two apparent extents of reaction, and the problem provides two measures of reaction progress, namely the O2 conversion and the selectivity for C2H4 over CO2. Thus, I can write the defining equations for these two measures of reaction progress.\n\n\n\n\\[\nf_{O_2} = \\frac{n_{O_2,0} - n_{O_2}}{n_{O_2,0}} = \\frac{n_{O_2,0} - \\left(n_{O_2,0} - \\xi_1 - 7 \\xi_2\\right)}{n_{O_2,0}} = \\frac{\\xi_1 + 7 \\xi_2}{n_{O_2,0}} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nS_{C_2H_4/CO_2} = \\frac{n_{C_2H_4}}{n_{CO_2}}  = \\frac{n_{C_2H_4,0} + 2 \\xi_1}{n_{CO_2,0} + 4 \\xi_2} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI can see that if I substitute the initial molar amount of O2 into equations (8) and (9) along with the expressions for the molar amounts of O2, C2H4, and CO2 from the mole table, I will have two equations with two unknowns, \\(\\xi_1\\) and \\(\\xi_2\\). So at this point I can calculate the apparent extents of reactions (1) and (2).\nAll that remains to complete this reaction progress task is to calculate the requested final mole fraction of CO2. To do that I simply need the defining equation for a mole fraction in a closed system, Equation 1.9.\n\n\n\n\\[\ny_{CO_2} = \\frac{n_{CO_2}}{n_{\\text{total}}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI can substitute the expressions for the molar amount of CO2 and the total molar amount from the mole table into equation (10).

The flow into the system contained 0.5 mol min−1 of N2O5 and 0.5 mol min−1 of N2 at 600 K and 5 MPa. Generate an expression for the concentration of NO2 in terms of the molar flow rate of N2O5, the inlet molar flows, the temperature, and the pressure. If the outlet flow contains 30% N2, calculate the outlet concentration of NO2.\n\\[\n2 N_2O_5 \\leftrightarrows 4 NO_2 + O_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I call a reaction progress task; it is something that is typically done as one step in the completion of a reaction engineering assighment. As I noted in the preceding example, the completion of reaction engineering assignments often requires the calculation of the composition of a system given information about its initial composition together with some measure of how much reaction has taken place. In this case an expression for the composition is requested instead of a value.\nGenerally here are the steps for completing a reaction progress task: (1) use the given information about the initial composition to calculate the initial molar amounts (for closed systems) or inlet molar flow rates (for open, steady-state systems) of every reagent present in the system, (2) use the resulting initial amounts and the given measure of reaction progress to calculate the apparent extent of reaction, (3) use the apparent extents of reaction to calculate (or here, write expressions for) the final molar amounts or flow rates, and (4) use those results to calculate the requested quantity (or write an expression for it).\nI will start by summarizing the information profided in the problem statement. The problem only mentions N2O5 and N2 as flowing into the system, so I’ll assume the inlet flows of NO2 and O2 are zero.\n\n\n\nGiven: \\(T = 600 \\text{ K}\\), \\(P = 5 \\text{ MPa}\\), \\(y_{N_2,out} = 0.3\\).\nGiven Initial Composition: \\(\\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} = 0.5 \\text{ mol min}^{-1}\\), \\(\\dot n_{N_2,in} = 0.5 \\text{ mol min}^{-1}\\), \\(\\dot n_{NO_2,in} = 0\\), \\(\\dot n_{O_2,in} = 0\\).\nRequested: an expression for \\(C_{NO_2}\\) and its value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI could write a mole table, but with only one reaction taking place, I think I can get by without one. Expressions for the molar flow rates of N2O5, NO2, and O2 are straightforward, Equation 3.12. Looking at the reaction, I can see that each time the reaction occurs as written the total number of moles increases by 3, from 2 to 5, so \\(\\dot n_{\\text{total}} = \\dot n_{\\text{total},in} + 3 \\dot \\xi\\).\n\n\n\nNecessary Equations\n\\[\n\\dot n_{N_2O_5} = \\dot n_{N_2O_5,in} - 2 \\dot \\xi \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{NO_2} = \\dot n_{NO_2,in} + 4 \\dot \\xi \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{O_2} = \\dot n_{O_2,in} + \\dot \\xi \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{N_2} = \\dot n_{N_2,in} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot n_{\\text{total}} = \\dot n_{\\text{total},in} + 3 \\dot \\xi \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to see What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this problem, two measures of the final composition are mentioned. The first is the concentration of NO2, and the other is the mole fraction of N2. I’ll write the defining equations for both, and for the concentration, I’ll also express the volumetric flow rate in terms of the molar amounts using the ideal gas equation. Then, I’ll substitute equations (2) through (6) for all of the molar flow rates.\n\n\n\n\\[\nC_{NO_2} = \\frac{\\dot n_{NO_2}}{\\dot V} = \\frac{P\\dot n_{NO_2}}{\\dot n_{total}RT} = \\frac{4P\\dot \\xi}{RT\\left( \\dot n_{\\text{total},in} + 3 \\dot \\xi \\right)} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_{N_2} = \\frac{\\dot n_{N_2}}{\\dot n_{total}} = \\frac{\\dot n_{N_2,in}}{\\dot n_{total,in} + 3 \\dot \\xi} \\tag{8}\n\\]\nExpression for \\(C_{NO_2}\\)\nThe problem asks for an expression for the concentration of NO2 in terms of the molar flow rate of N2O.

I often refer to this kind of task as an independent reactions task, since completing it involves identifying a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions that are taking place.\nI know from math courses I’ve taken that identifying mathematically independent equations involves constructing a matrix, and the same is true for identifying independent chemical reactions. Each column in the matrix corresponds to one of the reagants and each row corresponds to one of the reactions. The matrix element at any one row and column is the stoichiometric coefficent of the reagent corresponding to that column in the reaction corresponding to that row.\nHere the reaction matrix will have six rows, one for each reaction, and six columns, one for each reagent. I’ll let the first column corresponds to CO, the second to H2, the third to CH3OH, the fourth to CH4, the fifth to H2O, and the last to CO2. Letting the first row correspond to reaction (1), I see that the stoichiometric coefficient of CO in that reaction is -1, and so there is a -1 in the first column of row 1 (see equation (7) below). The stoichiometric coefficeint of H2 in the first reaction is -2, so there is a -2 in the second column of row 1. The stoichiometric coefficient of CH3OH in reaction (1) is +1, so there is a 1 in the third column of row 1. CH4, H2O, and CO2 do not appear in reaction (1), so there are zeros in the fourth, fifth and sixth columns of row 1. The remaining rows are filled in analogously.\nThe rank of this matrix will then equal the number of mathematically independent reactions. I’ll use computer software to find the rank.\n\n\n\nReaction Matrix\nEquation (7) shows a reaction matrix for this problem. The first row corresponds to reaction (1), the second row to reaction (2), and so on. The first column corresponds to CO, the second to H2, the third to CH3OH, the fourth to CH4, the fifth to H2O, and the last to CO2.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 0 & 1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 1 & 0 & 1 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{7}\n\\]\nMathematics software can be used to find that the rank of the matrix in equation (7) is equal to 3. This means that there will be 3 equations in any complete, mathematically independent subset of reactions (1) through (6).\nIn the matrix shown in equation (8) the first row corresponds to reaction (1) and the second row to reaction (2). The rank of this matrix is found to equal 2, so reactions (1) and (2) are mathematically independent.\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{8}\n\\]\nIn the matrix shown in equation (9) a third row, corresponding to reaction (3), was added to the matrix in equation (8). The rank of the matrix in equation (9) is 2. This means that reaction (3) is not independent; it is a linear combinations of reactions (1) and (2).\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{9}\n\\]\nReaction (3) was removed from the matrix and replaced with reaction (4), resulting in the matrix shown in equation (10). The rank of the matrix shown in equation (10) is 3, so the reactions corresponding to the rows of that matrix, in this case reactions (1), (2), and (4), represent a complete, mathematically independent subset of reactions (1) through (6).\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving identified a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions, I can now construct a mole table as requested in the problem statement. There are six reagents in this system: CO, H2, CH3OH, CH4, H2O, and CO2. As in Example 3.4.1, the first column of the mole table lists these reagents along with a row at the bottom for “Total.” The second column lists variables representing the initial molar amounts of each reagent and the third column lists expressions for the molar amounts of the reagents at any later time in terms of the apparent extents of the independent reactions. I need to use Equation 3.11 for the entries in the third column of of the mole table\n\\[\nn_i = n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\n\n\n\nFinal Answer\nWhile there are six reactions taking place in this system, only three reactions are mathematically independent. Therefore the mole table only uses the apparent extents of three reactions. Knowing that reactions (1), (2), and (4), represent a complete, mathematically independent subset of reactions (1) through (6), the apparent extents of those reactions were used to construct Table 3.2.\n\n\nTable 3.2: Mole Table for Example 3.4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nInitial Amount\nLater Amount\n\n\n\n\nCO\n\\(n_{CO,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CO,0} - \\xi_1 - \\xi_2 - \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nH2\n\\(n_{H_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{H_2,0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 3 \\xi_2 + \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nCH3OH\n\\(n_{CH_3OH,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CH_3OH,0} + \\xi_1\\)\n\n\nCH4\n\\(n_{CH_4,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CH_4,0} + \\xi_2\\)\n\n\nH2O\n\\(n_{H_2O,0}\\)\n\\(n_{H_2O,0} + \\xi_2 - \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nCO2\n\\(n_{CO_2,0}\\)\n\\(n_{CO_2,0} + \\xi_4\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0}\\)\n\\(n_{\\text{total},0} - 2 \\xi_1 - 2 \\xi_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactions (1), (2), and (4) are not the only complete, mathematically independent subset. For example, reactions (1), (4), and (5) is also a complete, mathematically independent subset and the mole table could have been written using \\(\\xi_1\\), \\(\\xi_4\\), and \\(\\xi_5\\).\nThe solution presented here used a reaction matrix. Appendix A describes identifying independent reactions using the stoichiometric coefficient matrix where the columns correspond to the reactions and the rows to the reagents. The reaction matrix is the transpose of the stoichiometric coefficient matrix, and the rank of a matrix equals the rank of its transpose. For that reason, either the method used here or the method described in Appendix A can be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Calculation of the Final Composition of a Closed System using the Conversion, Yield, Selectivity and Apparent Extents of Reaction\nA chemical system initially contains 34 mol CO and 66 mol H2. At system conditions, reactions (1) through (6) occur. At the end of the process, the CO conversion is 40%, the yield of CH3OH is 10.7% (mol CH3OH per initial mol CO), and the selectivity for methanol vs. methane is 0.38 mol CH3OH per mol CH4.

    "section": "4.1 Reaction Rates",
    "text": "4.1 Reaction Rates\nThe true extent of reaction \\(j\\), \\(\\Xi_j\\), was defined in Chapter 3 to be the net number of times molecular reaction event \\(j\\) has occurred, expressed in moles. Consider a volume, \\(V\\), where the temperature, pressure and composition are uniform and reaction \\(j\\) is taking place. The instantaneous net rate of reaction \\(j\\), \\(r_j\\), is then defined as shown in Equation 4.1. When this definition is used, the rate is said to be normalized per unit volume, and the rate is an intensive quantity.\n\\[\nr_j = \\frac{1}{V} \\frac{d\\Xi_j}{dt}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nRates can be normalized using quantities other than the volume. Generally, the best normalization factor is the size of the location where the reaction takes place. The systems considered so far in Reaction Engineering Basics, were a single phase fluid. For a single phase fluid, the reaction takes place everywhere in the fluid, so the volume is a good normalization factor. When two phases are present, it may be more complicated. For example, the reaction may only take place at the interface between the two phases, and in this case the interfacial area would be the best normalization factor.\nIn practice, normalization factors are sometimes chosen for convenience. As an example, the mass of a solid catalyst is often used to normalize heterogeneous catalytic reactions. A heterogeneous catalyst is a material that exists as a separate phase in contact with the fluid containing the reagents. It causes the rate of reaction to increase, but it is neither a reactant nor a product of the reaction. The reaction does not take place within the solid mass of the catalyst, but instead on its surface. Nonetheless, it is quite common to normalize heterogeneous catalytic reaction rates using the mass of the catalyst.\nIt is straightforward to renormalize a rate. All that is needed is the ratio of the factor used to normalize the rate to the desired normalization factor. In the example of a catalytic reaction normalized per catalyst mass, knowing the ratio of the mass of catalyst to the surface area of the catalyst, the rate per catalyst mass multiplied by that ratio would equal the rate per catalyst area. Example 4.5.1 illustrates the renormalization of a reaction rate.\nThe rate as defined in Equation 4.1 is based upon the reaction expression. The net rate of generation of reagent \\(i\\) due to the occurrence of reaction \\(j\\) is determined by the stoichiometry as shown in Equation 4.2. Recalling the sign convention for stoichiometric coefficients, if \\(i\\) is a reactant, its stoichiometric coefficient, and hence its rate of generation, will be negative. This make sense since a reactant is consumed by the reaction. A negative rate of generation is the same as a positive rate of consumption. If multiple reactions are taking place, the overall net rate of generation of \\(i\\) is the sum of its net rate of generation in each reaction. Example 4.5.1 illustrates conversion of a species generation rate to a general reaction rate.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} = \\nu_{i,j} r_j\n\\tag{4.2}\\]\nEquation 4.1 and Equation 4.2 are expressions for the net rate of reaction \\(j\\) and the net rate of generation of \\(i\\) via reaction \\(j\\). It is also possible to define two absolute rates, one in the forward direction and the other in the reverse direction. That is, the change in the absolute number of times reactant molecules are converted to products due to the occurrence of molecular reaction event \\(j\\) defines the absolute rate of reaction \\(j\\) in the forward direction, \\(r_{j,f}\\). The change in the absolute number of times product molecules are converted to reactant molecules due to the occurrence of reaction \\(j\\) in the reverse direction similarly defines the absolute rate of reaction \\(j\\) in the reverse direction, \\(r_{j,r}\\). The net rate of reaction defined in Equation 4.1 is then simply the difference between the absolute rates as shown in Equation 4.3.\n\\[\nr_j = r_{j,f} - r_{j,r}\n\\tag{4.3}\\]"

In that chapter it was noted that an instantaneous yield and an instantaneous selectivity can also be defined. Now, having defined species generation rates, that is possible. The instantaneous yield of product D from reactant \\(i\\) is simply the ratio of the rate of generation of D divided by the rate of consumption of \\(i\\), Equation 4.4. The negative sign in Equation 4.4 is needed to convert the rate of generation of \\(i\\) in the denominator to a rate of consumption. The rate of any reaction is expected to vary as the temperature, pressure and composition vary. That is the reason for referring to \\(Y_{D/i,inst}\\) as the instantaneous yield.

Selectivities can involve groups of products, e. g. selectivity for olefins relative to parafins. In that case, the numerator in Equation 4.5 would need an additional sum over all products, D, that were olefins and the denominator would need an additional sum over all products, U, that were parafins.\n\\[\nS_{D/U,inst} = - \\frac{-\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{D,j}}{\\displaystyle \\sum _j r_{U,j}}\n\\tag{4.5}\\]"

The waste produced during cell growth can be valuable chemicals such as penicillin. It is sometimes possible to treat the cell growth process as if it is a chemical reaction. When this is possible, the methods of chemical reaction engineering can be applied to design and operate the process.\nDifferent nomenclature is used to describe cell growth than is used to describe chemical reactions. The reactors are often referred to as chemostats or fermentors. The nutrients being fed to the system are often called substrates and not reactants.\nAnother difference between cell growth and chemical reactions is that there isn’t any stoichiometry associated with cell growth. In order to treat cell growth like a chemical reaction, it is necessary to use an average ratio of nutrient consumption to cell mass increase. This effective stoichiometry is typically expressed in terms of masses. Similarly, cell growth rates are typically defined in terms of cell mass as shown in Equation 4.6. \\[\nr_g = \\frac{1}{V}\\lim _{\\Delta t \\to 0} \\frac {\\Delta m_{cells}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{V} \\frac{dm_{cells}}{dt}\n\\tag{4.6}\\]\nThe specific cell growth rate, \\(\\mu\\), is a related growth rate.

    "section": "4.4 Rate Expressions",
    "text": "4.4 Rate Expressions\nReaction rates change as the temperature, pressure and composition of the system change. A rate expression is an equation for calculating the net rate of a reaction as a function of those variables. The form of an equilibrium expression is known from the stoichiometric coefficients in the reaction expression (Equation C.8). That is not necessarily true of the rate expression for a non-elementary reaction. The form of the rate expression for a non-elementary reaction is not known, a priori.\nAll rate expressions must satisfy two requirements. First, a rate expression must be single-valued. At a points in space with a given temperature, pressure and composition, the rate will always be the same. If the rate expression had two (non-imaginary) roots at those conditions, one would not know which was the correct rate. Hence rate expressions must be single-valued.\nThe second requirement relates to equilibrium. When a temperature, pressure and composition that correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium are substituted into a rate expression, it must evaluate to zero. While the absolute forward and absolute reverse rates are non-zero at equilibrium, the net rate is always equal to zero. For this reason, it is not uncommon for the equilibrium constant to be present in one of the terms in a rate expression.\n\n4.4.1 Validation of Rate Expressions\nExperimental kinetics data are needed in order to establish a rate expression for a given reaction. The generation of experimental kinetics data is discussed in Chapter 8. For present purposes, experimental kinetics data may be taken to consist of many data points. Each kinetics data point includes some measure of the composition (typically concentrations or partial pressures of all reagents), the temperature, the pressure, and the reaction rate at those conditions.\nThe approach to establishing a rate expression for a reaction begins by postulating the mathematical form of the rate expression. For elementary reactions, the mathematical form may be postulated on the basis of theory. For non-elementary reactions, one approach involves simply picking a mathematical form that is convenient to work with. Of course, the resulting rate expression still must accurately predict the reaction rate as a function of temperature, pressure and composition. It also must satisfy the two requirements of being single-valued and of evaluating to zero at equilibrium. When initially chosen, the mathematical form typically contains one or more unknown constants. These constants can be referred to as kinetics parameters and their values can be chosen to make the rate expression as accurate as possible while still satisfying the rate expression requirements.\nOnce a mathematical form has been postulated, the next step is called parameter estimation. The parameter estimation step is presented in Chapters 9, 11, and 10. It uses statistical methods to find the values of each unknown kinetics parameter that appears in the rate expression. The experimental kinetics data are used to find these values. The parameters are chosen so that the rate predicted by the rate expression for each experimental data point is as close as possible to the experimentally measured rate for that data point. Parameter estimation is sometimes referred to as fitting a rate expression to the experimental data.\nIn addition to the best values of the kinetics parameters, parameter estimation generates additional information. Some measure of the uncertainty in the values of the kinetics parameters is typically produced. Common examples are an estimate of the standard deviation or the 95% confidence interval for each parameter. Other statistical measures of how accurately the model represents the data (or how well the model “fits” the data) are also generated. Well-known examples include the correlation coefficient, \\(R\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). Example 4.5.4 illustrates parameter estimation using experimental data.\nThe next step in the process of establishing a rate expression for a reaction is assessing the accuracy of the rate expression. This assessment makes use of the statistical measures generated during parameter estimation. It may also include additional graphical methods. It should be noted that while parameter estimation yields the “best” values of the parameters, that does not mean that the underlying model is accurate. As an example, when \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) data are plotted, the plotted points might resemble a parabola. Parameter estimation can be used to find the best slope, \\(m\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), of a straight line model, \\(y = mx + b\\), for those data, but the resulting straight line still would not be accurate as seen in Figure 4.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Straight line fit to a set of data that fall exactly on a parabola. While the “best” slope of the straight line is -2 and the “best” intercept is 8.6667, the line does not represent the data accurately.\n\n\nAccuracy assessment results in one of three decisions. If the rate expression is deemed to be sufficiently accurate for its intended purpose, the rate expression is accepted. Having been evaluated against experimental data, it can be said that the rate expression has been validated. This is always a judgement call, and as noted, it may be affected by the intended use of the rate expression. When a rate expression will be used to design a reactor for a multi-million dollar process, much higher accuracy may be required than if the rate expression is going to be used to size a small laboratory reactor.\nThe second possible decision is to generate additional data and then repeat the parameter estimation. This might happen if the accuracy is reasonable, but the uncertainty in the estimated value of one or more parameters is large. Experiments would be selected to try to reduce the uncertainty in those parameter values.\nThe third possible decision would be to reject the postulated mathematical form for the rate expression. A different mathematical form would then be postulated and the whole process would be repeated. Often, the inaccuracy observed with rejected model will suggest modifications to be used in the next postulated model. It is possible that a number of postulated models will be rejected before an acceptably accurate rate expression is found.\n\n\n4.4.2 Rate Coefficients\nEvery rate expression contains a quantity known as the rate coefficient. A lower case \\(k\\) is usually used to represent a rate coefficient. Additional subscripts may be added to indicate the reaction and other specifics about the rate coefficient. Rate coefficients depend upon temperature. By far the most common equation for modeling the temperature dependence of a rate coefficient is the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8.\n\\[\nk_j = k_{0,j} \\exp{\\left(  \\frac{-E_j}{RT} \\right)}\n\\tag{4.8}\\]\nWhen using Equation 4.8, the temperature must be expressed in absolute units, either K or °R. The constants, \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) are kinetics parameters known as the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy, respectively. It should be noted that the activation energy, \\(E_j\\), is a positive quantity.\nAs with other kinetics parameters, the values of \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) are determined during the parameter estimation stage of the validation of the rate expression. The most common way of doing this uses linear least squares. Taking the logarithm of each side of the Arrhenius expression yields Equation 4.9. Letting \\(y = \\ln{k_j}\\) and \\(x = \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right)\\), it can be seen that Equation 4.9 is a linear equation with a slope equal to \\(E_j\\) and an intercept equal to \\(\\ln{k_{0,j}}\\). As such, linear least squares can be used to estimate \\(E_j\\) and \\(k_{0,j}\\).\n\\[\n\\ln{k_j} = E_j \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right) + \\ln{k_{0,j}}\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\nIn addition to the estimated values of \\(E_j\\) and \\(k_{0,j}\\), linear least squares can be used to find the 95% confidence intervals for \\(E_j\\) and \\(k_{0,j}\\) and the coefficient of determinations, \\(R^2\\). Typical nomenclature for reporting an estimated parameter and its 95% confidence interval is provided in Appendix B. As an example, \\(E\\) = 20.0, 95% CI [19.2, 21.0] kJ mol-1 means that the best estimate for \\(E\\) is 20.0 kJ mol-1 with a 95% confidence interval between 19.2 and 21.0 kJ mol-1.\nOnce the values of the parameters have been estimated, a so-called model plot can be prepared. In a model plot, the experimental \\(x\\) vs. \\(y_\\text{expt}\\) data are plotted as points, and on the same axes, the model-predicted \\(x\\) vs. \\(y_\\text{pred}\\) data are plotted as a line. The following criteria will be satisfied if the Arrhenius expression accurately predicts the experimental results.\n\nIn the model plot, the experimental data points will scatter randomly about the line for the predicted results. The deviations from the line will be small and there will not be any systematic deviations about the line.\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), will be close to 1.0\nThe uncertainty in each parameter will be small relative to its value.\n\nThe estimation of Arrhenius parameters and assessment of the resulting expression are illustrated in Example 4.5.4.\n\n\n4.4.3 Empirical Rate Expressions\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics, the term empirical rate expression is used to refer to an experimentally validated rate expression in which the mathematical form was chosen for convenience. Power-law rate expressions are very common empirical rate expressions. In a power-law rate expression, the rate is proposed to depend upon the concentration or partial pressure (for gases) of each reagent in the system raised to an unknown power as shown in Equation 4.10 and Equation 4.11.\n\\[\nr_j = k_j \\prod_i C_i^{\\alpha_i}\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_j \\prod_i P_i^{\\alpha_i}\n\\tag{4.11}\\]\nIn power-law rate expressions, the exponents, \\(\\alpha_i\\), are unknown kinetics parameters. Their values are found during the parameter estimation stage of validating the rate expression. They do not necessarily equal the stoichiometric coefficient of \\(i\\) in reaction \\(j\\), nor are they necessarily integers or simple fractions. The rate may not depend on the amount of every species in the system. That is, for some reagents, \\(\\alpha_i\\) may be equal to zero. The sum of all of the exponents is known as the reaction order. The value of the exponent, \\(\\alpha_i\\) is the reaction order in \\(i\\).\nThe \\(k_j\\) in Equation 4.10 and Equation 4.11 represents the rate coefficient for reaction \\(j\\). Rate coefficients are not necessarily the only source of temperature dependence in rate expressions. It was noted earlier in this chapter that it is not uncommon for equilibrium constants to appear in rate expressions. Despite being called an equilibrium constant, they actually vary with temperature. If the standard entropy and standard enthalpy of reaction \\(j\\) are assumed to be constant, the equilibrium constant varies with temperature as shown in Equation 4.12. Equation 4.12 is similar to the Arrhenius expression for the temperature dependence of rate coefficients. One difference is that the heat of reaction, \\(\\Delta H_j^0\\) can be either positive or negative, but the activation energy, \\(E_j\\), is always positive.\n\\[\nK_j = \\exp{\\frac{\\Delta S_j^0}{R}} \\exp{\\frac{-\\Delta H_j^0}{RT}} = K_{0,j}\\exp{\\frac{-\\Delta H_j^0}{RT}}\n\\tag{4.12}\\]\nThe net rate of a reversible reaction will go to zero while reactants are still remaining. It is important to check that postulated rate expressions evaluate to zero at equilibrium. A power-law rate expression will not do so. Any postulated rate expression can be modified so that it does properly evaluate to zero at equilibrium by simply multiplying it by the factor shown in Equation 4.13. That equation assumes that \\(K_{j,c}\\) is a concentration-based equilibrium constant. An equivalent equation using partial pressures and a partial pressure-based equilibrium constant can be used with ideal gases, Equation 4.14. Notice that within this factor, the exponent for each species’ concentration is its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction \\(j\\). That is, there are no kinetics parameters in these factors. Example 4.5.2 illustrates the use of Equation 4.14 to force a rate expression to evaluate to zero at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n\\[\n\\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{\\displaystyle \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu _i,j}}{K_{j,c}} \\right\\}\n\\tag{4.13}\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{\\displaystyle \\prod_i P_i^{\\nu _i,j}}{K_{j,p}} \\right\\}\n\\tag{4.14}\\]\nPower-law rate expressions can sometimes be used for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Often, however, they do not describe the variation of the rate with sufficient accuracy. An old paper by Yang and Hougen (1950) provides a set of tables that can be used to generate many mathematical functions that can be tested as rate expressions for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.\nAs previously noted, it is sometimes possible to model processes involving the growth of living cells as if they involved chemical reactions. Rate expressions are needed in order to do so. One common expression for the specific cell growth rate is the Monod equation, Equation 4.15. In that expression \\(\\mu_{max}\\) and \\(K_s\\) are kinetics parameters whose values are determined using parameter estimation methods. The substrate concentration, \\(C_S\\), in Equation 4.15 is a mass concentration and not a molar concentration. Example 4.5.3 considers limiting cases of the Monod equation for cell growth.\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{K_s + C_S}\n\\tag{4.15}\\]\n\n\n4.4.4 Theoretical Rate Expressions\nIt was noted above that the mathematical form for a non-elementary reaction is not known a priori. The reason for this is that at the molecular level, the non-elementary reaction doesn’t occur as a single event. All breaking and forming of bonds does not occur simultaneously, and as a consequence, intermediate species are created. In other words, a non-elementary reaction is actually a group of reactions that is treated as if it were a single reaction. As such, it does not lend itself to a general theoretical treatment. In contrast, an elementary reaction is a single molecular event where all breaking and forming of bonds is simultaneous.\nBeing a single molecular event, elementary reactions can be considered from a theoretical perspective. The theory can then be used to predict the mathematical form of rate expressions for elementary reactions. Two such theories are described in Appendices E and F. Collision theory is based upon the kinetic theory of gases. It assumes that molecular velocities obey a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and that when molecules with sufficient kinetic energy collide, they react. (See Appendix E for a more complete description of the theory and a derivation of the associated reaction rate expression.) Transition state theory assumes that the reactants in a system are in a kind of thermodynamic equilibrium with activated complexes that are forming products. It uses statistical thermodynamics to determine the number of such complexes and the frequency at which they decompose. The absolute rate in the forward direction is then equal to the product of those two quantities. (See Appendix F for a more complete description of the theory and a derivation of the associated reaction rate expression.)\nAccording to either theory, the net rate of elementary reaction \\(j\\) can be written as shown in Equation 4.16, but they predict different dependence of the pre-exponential factor, \\(k_{0,j}\\) upon temperature. (Recall that the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, predicts that the pre-exponential factor is constant.) Generally, the variation of \\(k_{0,j}\\) with temperature is very small compared to the variation of the exponential term, \\(\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j}}{RT}\\right)}\\). As a result, an accurate rate expression usually results if \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) are taken to be constant kinetics parameters.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)} \\left(\\prod_i C_i^{-\\nu_{i,j}}\\right) \\\\\n&- \\frac{k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{j,eq_c}} \\left(\\prod_{i^\\prime} C_{i^\\prime}^{\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4.16}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) indexes all reactants in reaction \\(j\\) and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes all products in reaction \\(j\\).\nFor an ideal gas system, the concentration of reagent \\(i\\) is equal to its partial pressure divided by \\(RT\\). Making that substiution for each concentration in Equation 4.16 yields a rate expression in terms of partial pressures. The variation of the \\(RT\\) terms that this introduces is again small compared to the \\(\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j}}{RT}\\right)}\\) term. As a result, the \\(RT\\) terms can be incorporated into the pre-exponential factor and the pre-exponential factor again can be taken to be a constant kinetics parameter. This results in Equation 4.17.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)} \\left(\\prod_i P_i^{-\\nu_{i,j}}\\right) \\\\\n&- \\frac{k_{0,j}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{j,eq_p}} \\left(\\prod_{i^\\prime} P_{i^\\prime}^{\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}}\\right)\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{4.17}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) indexes all reactants in reaction \\(j\\) and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes all products in reaction \\(j\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall from Chapter 1 that a reaction like Equation 4.18 is called a unimolecular reaction. Unimolecular reactions are not elementary reactions (Lindemann et al. (1922)). Nonetheless, the rate expression resulting from application of Equation 4.16 or Equation 4.17 is generally found to be valid unless the pressure is very low. In Reaction Engineering Basics, rate expressions for unimolecular reactions will be assumed to have the mathematical form predicted by Equation 4.16 or Equation 4.17. As such, the mathematical form of the rate expression for Equation 4.18 is as shown in Equation 4.19 or Equation 4.20.\n\\[\nA_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 A\n\\tag{4.18}\\]\n\\[\nr = k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}C_{A_2} -  \\frac{k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{eq_c}} C_A^2\n\\tag{4.19}\\]\n\\[\nr = k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}P_{A_2} -  \\frac{k_0\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E}{RT}\\right)}}{K_{eq_p}} P_A^2\n\\tag{4.20}\\]\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to discern whether a reaction is elementary by simply looking at the reaction expression. Unless one knows from other information that a reaction is elementary, the rate expressions in Equation 4.16 and Equation 4.17 should be treated as postulated rate expressions. The values of \\(k_{0,j}\\) and \\(E_j\\) should be determined by statistical parameter estimation using experimental kinetics data, after which the accuracy of the resulting rate expression should be assessed.\nImportantly, the equilibrium constant in Equation 4.16 and Equation 4.17 is not a kinetics parameter and its value should not be determined by parameter estimation methods. The one exception to this, discussed in Chapter 5, would be if the equilibrium constant for reaction \\(j\\) and its temperature dependence (or equivalently, the heat, free energy and entropy of reaction \\(j\\)) are not available and can not easily be measured. In that case, the equilibrium constant can be written as in Equation 4.12 with \\(K_{0,j}\\) and \\(\\Delta H_j^0\\) treated as kinetics parameters.\n\n\n4.4.5 Mechanistic Rate Expressions\nThere is another way to postulate the mathematical form of the rate expression for an non-elementary reaction. It stems from knowing that a non-elementary reaction actually represents a group of molecular level reactions. It involves guessing the specific molecular level reactions that are involved, and then combining the rate expressions for those molecular level reactions. This approach for postulating the rate expression for a non-elementary reaction is the topic of Chapter 5."

(One reason for this is that ammonia is used to make fertilizer.) It is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction. The ammonia synthesis catalyst takes the form of pellets that pack into the the reactor with an apparent density of 155 lbm ft-3. Rase (1977) provides the expression in equation (2) for the rate of generation of ammonia via reaction (1). In that expression, \\(E_1\\) is the activation energy, \\(K_{1,eq}\\) is the equilibrium constant and \\(a_i\\) represents the thermodynamic activity of reagent \\(i\\).\n\\[\n3 H_2 + N_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 NH_3 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_{NH_3,1} &= 1.54 \\times 10^{15} \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\\\\n&\\times \\left[ K_{1,eq}^2\\left( \\frac{a_{N_2}a_{H_2}^{1.5}}{a_{NH_3}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{a_{NH_3}}{a_{H_2}^{1.5}} \\right)  \\right] \\frac{\\text{kmol NH}_3}{\\text{m}_{\\text{bed}}^3 \\text{h}}\n\\end{align} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nWrite an expression for the general rate of reaction (1), \\(r_1\\), that is normalized per lbm of catalyst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that the units of a reaction rate are always moles per time per normalization factor. For a rate expression, that means that if you multiply the units of the pre-exponential factor by the units of the composition variables in the rate expression, you should end up with units of moles per time per normalization factor. Looking at equation (2) I see that the pre-exponential factor has units of moles (actually kmol NH3) per time per volume of the bed (in cubic meters). The equilibrium constant and the thermodynamic activities do not have units, so the rate also has units of moles per time per volume of the bed.\nSo, from the units on the pre-exponential factor in equation (2), I can see that the rate normalization factor is the volume of the catalyst bed. The problem asks for a rate normalized per mass of catalyst, so solving this problem will involve renormalizaton of the rate. To do that, I need to know the ratio of the old normalization factor to the new normalization factor. Here that ratio is given in the problem statement. It is the reciprocal of the apparent density, so dividing equation (2) by the apparent density will renormalize the rate.\nI can also see, both from the units and from the variable used to represent the rate in equation (2), that the rate expression yields a species generation rate, specifically the rate of generation of ammonia. The problem asks for an expression for the general reaction rate (not the rate of species generation), so the solution will also involve converting from a species generation rate to a reacton rate.\n\n\n\nGiven\n\\(\\rho _{bed}\\) = 155 lbm ft-3.\nNecessary Equations\nEquation 4.2 can be used to convert the species generation rate to the general reaction rate. Applying that equation to the present problem yields equation (3).\n\\[\nr_{i,j} = \\nu_{i,j} r_j \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r_j = \\frac{r_{i,j}}{\\nu_{i,j}}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = \\frac{r_{NH_3,1}}{\\nu _{NH_3,1}} = \\frac{r_{NH_3,1}}{2} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nThe rate expression in equation (2) is normalized using the volume of the catalyst bed. Upon substitution in equation (3), the resulting reaction rate also will be normalized by the volume of the catalyst bed. The apparent bed density is the mass of catalyst divided by the volume of the bed, so the rate per bed volume can be converted to the rate per catalyst mass simply by dividing by the apparent bed density, equation (4), where \\(r_1^\\prime\\) is the renormalized rate expression.\n\\[\nr_1^\\prime = r_1 \\frac{V_{cat}}{m_{cat}} = \\frac{r_1}{\\rho _{bed}} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nCalculations\n\nSubstitute equation (2) in equation (3).\nSubstitute the result from step 1 and the given bed density into equation (4).\n\nResult\nPerforming the calculations as described yields the rate expression shown in equation (5).

Suppose the rate expression shown in equation (2) was validated using experimental data that were far from thermodynamic equilibrium. At 675 K, the rate coefficient, \\(k_1\\), was found to equal to 3.37 lbmol h-1 ft-3 atm-0.55. In equation (3), that power-law rate expression has been multiplied by a factor that will force it to evaluate to zero at equilibrium. At 675 K, the equilibrium constant, \\(K_1\\) is equal to 12.0.\nIf a system initially containing 75% H2O, 24% CO, and 1% CO2 at 10 atm and 675 K reacts isothermally and isobarically, the equilibrium conversion of CO will equal 96%. The net rate should go to zero at this conversion.\n\\[\nCO + H_2O \\rightleftarrows CO_2 + H_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 P_{CO}^{0.9} P_{H_2O}^{0.25} P_{CO_2}^{-0.6} \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 P_{CO}^{0.9} P_{H_2O}^{0.25} P_{CO_2}^{-0.6} \\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{P_{CO_2} P_{H_2}}{K_1 P_{CO} P_{H_2O}} \\right\\} \\tag{3}\n\\]\nFor the system described above, make a plot of the net rate of reaction (1) predicted by equations (2) and (3) at CO conversions between 0 and 100%. Then make a second plot at conversions between 85 and 100%. Comment upon the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI am asked to plot the rates predicted by equations (2) and (3) as a function of the CO conversion, given an initial composition, temperature, and pressure. Looking at the equations, I can see that I will need the partial pressures of the reagents to calculate the rate. I know the initial composition and I can choose the conversions to be plotted, so the first part of this problem is basically a reaction progress problem, similar to those presented in Chapter 3.\nNone of the quantities that are given are extensive, so I may choose a basis. The temperature and pressure are given, so if I choose a volume as the basis for my calculations, I can use the ideal gas law to calculate the initial molar amounts.\n\n\n\nGiven\n\\(k_1\\) = 3.37 lbmol h-1 ft-3 atm-0.55, \\(K_1\\) = 12.0, \\(y_{H_2O,0}\\) = 0.75, \\(y_{CO,0}\\) = 0.24, \\(y_{CO_2,0}\\) = 0.01, \\(P\\) = 10 atm, \\(T\\) = 675 K, \\(f_{CO,eq}\\) = 0.96.\nBasis\n\\(V\\) = 1 L.\nNecessary Equations\nThe initial percentages of CO, H2O, and CO2 sum to 100%, so the initial mole fraction of H2 must equal zero. Using the chosen basis, the initial molar amounts of the reagents can be calculated using the ideal gas law as shown in equations (4) through (7).\n\\[\nn_{CO,0} = \\frac{y_{CO,0} PV}{RT} \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{H_2O,0} = \\frac{y_{H_2O,0} PV}{RT} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{CO_2,0} = \\frac{y_{CO_2,0} PV}{RT} \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{H_2,0} = \\frac{\\cancelto{0}{y_{H_2,0}} PV}{RT} = 0 \\tag{7}\n\\]\nKnowing the initial moles of CO, the final moles of CO at any conversion can be calculated using the definition of conversion, equation (8).\n\\[\nn_{CO} = n_{CO,0}\\left(1 - f_{CO}\\right) \\tag{8}\n\\]\nThat result, together with the previously determined initial moles of CO allows the calculation of the extent of reaction, equation (9)\n\\[\nn_{CO} = n_{CO,0} - \\xi_1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\xi_1 = n_{CO,0} - n_{CO} \\tag{9}\n\\]\nThe final molar amounts of the other reagents can next be computed using their initial amounts and the extent of reaction, equations (10) through (12).\n\\[\nn_{H_2O} = n_{H_2O,0} - \\xi_1 \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{CO_2} = n_{CO_2,0} - \\xi_1 \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{H_2} = \\cancelto{0}{n_{H_2,0}} + \\xi_1 \\tag{12}\n\\]\nThe ideal gas law can then be used to calculate the final partial pressures of the reagents as shown in equations (13) through (16).\n\\[\nP_{CO} = \\frac{n_{CO}RT}{V} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{H_2O} = \\frac{n_{H_2O}RT}{V} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{CO_2} = \\frac{n_{CO_2}RT}{V} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_{H_2} = \\frac{n_{H_2}RT}{V} \\tag{16}\n\\]\nAt this point the rates predicted by equations (2) and (3) can be calculated.\nCalculations\n\nSubstitute the given values and the chosen basis into all equations.\nCalculate the initial moles of CO, H2O, CO2, and H2 using equations (4) through (7).\nChoose a CO conversion between 0 and 100%.\n\nCalculate the final moles of CO at that conversion using equation (8).\nCalculate the apparent extent of reaction using equation (9).\nCalculate the final moles of H2O, CO2, and H2 using equations (10) through (12).\nCalculate the final partial pressures of CO, H2O, CO2, and H2 using equations (13) through (16).\nCalculate the rate predicted by equation (2).\nCalculate the rate predicted by equation (3).\n\nRepeat step 3 to generate a set of conversions that span the range from 0 to 100% and the corresponding rates predicted by equations (2) and (3).\nPlot the full set of results.\nPlot the results for conversions between 85% and 100%.\n\nResults and Comments\nFigure 4.2 shows the rate of reaction (1) predicted by equations (2) and (3) at conversions between 0 and 100%, based upon isothermal, isobaric reaction with an initial mixture of 75% H2O, 24% CO, and 1% CO2 at 10 atm and 675 K. Figure 4.3 shows the same data, but only for conversions between 85 and 100%.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Rate of water-gas shift as a function of CO conversion as predicted by power-law rate expressions with and without a factor that forces them to evaluate to zero at equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Rate of water-gas shift at conversions near equilibrium as predicted by power-law rate expressions with and without a factor that forces them to evaluate to zero at equilibrium.\n\n\nThe figures allow two important observations. First, Figure 4.2 shows that adding the term to force proper behavior at equilibrium does not affect the predicted rate at conditions far from equilibrium. Hence, since rate expression (2) was validated and found to be accurate at conditions far from equilibrium, the figure shows that rate expression (3) will be equally accurate at those conditions.\nSecond, Figure 4.3 shows that when the reaction reaches equilbrium at 96% conversion, rate expression (2) predicts that the rate will equal 0.37 lbmol h-1 ft-3 while rate expression (3) predicts the rate will be zero. The consequences of using rate expression (2), for example to design a reactor where the conversion approaches equilibrium, could be severe. The design calculations would indicate that, for example, 98% conversion could be achieved in the reactor, but of course, if the reactor was built, the conversion would never exceed 96%. If rate expression (3) was used to design a reactor, the calculations would indicate that the largest possible conversion is 96%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Figure 4.3 shows conversions greater than equilibrium, it should be noted that one could not reach the conversions above 96% by reacting the starting mixture at constant \\(T\\) and \\(P\\). However, one could make a mixture of the reagents that has the same composition as if the initial mixture had reached a higher conversion. Figure 4.3 shows that if one did this, the reaction of that mixture would be predicted to have a negative rate. That is, the reaction would proceed in the reverse direction, and when it reached a composition equivalent to 96% conversion of the initial mixture in the problem statement, the rate would again go to zero because the system would be at equilibrium.\nAlso, Figure 4.3 only shows conversions up to 99% for rate expression (3). The reason for this is that rate expression (3) preducts a rate of negative infinity at 100% conversion. At 100% conversion, the partial pressure of CO would equal zero, and since \\(P_{CO}\\) appears in the denominator in the equilbrium factor, the factor becomes equal to negative infinity. The important point is that if one has a rate expression for the forward rate of a reversible reaction that includes a factor to force proper equilibrium behavior, that rate expression should not be used to predict the rate of the reverse reaction. Instead, a reverse rate expression should be postulated and experimentally validated.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.3 Limiting Cell Growth Rates Predicted by the Monod Equation\nThe growth rate of a certain microbial cell line is accurately represented by the Monod equation with \\(\\mu _{max}\\) equal to 1 h-1 and \\(K_s\\) equal to 0.2 g L-1. Plot the specific growth rate vs. the mass concentration of substrate over a sufficiently wide range of concentrations to show all limiting behavior. Describe the asymptotic behavior mathematically and in terms of what is happening physically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem statement pretty much tells me what to do. The only thing I don’t know is how large \\(C_S\\) will need to be in order to see the limiting behavior. I know that zero is the smallest value. I will simply pick a largest value and make the plot. If the plot doesn’t show the limiting behavior, I’ll change the largest value and repeat until the plot is acceptable.\n\n\n\nGiven\n\\(\\mu_{max}\\) = 1 h-1, \\(K_s\\) = 0.2 g L-1.\nNecessary Equations\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{K_s + C_S} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nCalculations\n\nChoose values of \\(C_S\\) and use equation (1) to calculate the corresponding value of \\(\\mu\\).\nPlot the results.\n\nIf the figure does not show limiting behavior, change the maximum value of \\(C_S\\) and repeat from step 1.\n\n\nResult\nFigure 4.4 shows the specific cell growth rate predicted by the Monod equation. At very low substrate concentration, the curve is nearly linear. Looking at equation (1) it can be seen that when the substrate concentration is neglibibly small compared to \\(K_s\\), the Monod equation reduces to equation (2). Equation (2) is a linear equation with the slope equal to \\(\\frac{\\mu_{max}}{K_s}\\). Physically this corresponds to a situation where the amount of available nutrient (substrate) is so small that the cells can’t all get enough to grow. Put differently, in this situation the cells are forced to compete with each other for nutrient. When one of the competing cells takes in nutrient, it grows, but the others can’t.\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{K_s + \\cancelto{0}{C_S}} = \\frac{\\mu_{max}}{K_s}C_S \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Specific cell growth rate predicted by the Monod equation with \\(\\mu_{max}\\) = 1 h-1 and \\(K_s\\) = 0.2 g L-1.\n\n\nAs the substrate concentration becomes very large, Figure 4.4 suggests that the specific growth rate will become constant. This can be seen by examination of equation (1). When \\(K_s\\) becomes negligibly small compared to \\(C_S\\), the Monod equation reduces to equation (3) where the specific growth rate is constant and equal to \\(\\mu_{max}\\). Physically, this limit is the opposite of the first. Here the nutrient is abundant and each cell can take in as much as it needs. Every cell is taking in nutrient and growing as fast as it can, so increasing the amount of nutrient has no effect.\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{\\mu_{max}C_S}{\\cancelto{0}{K_s} + C_S} = \\mu_{max} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n\n4.5.4 Estimating the Pre-exponential Factor and Activation Energy in the Arrhenius Expression.\nKinetic studies were performed at a number of different temperatures, \\(T\\), to find the value of a second order rate coefficient, \\(k\\), at those temperatures. The results for each experiment, \\(i\\), are given in the table below. Determine whether the temperature dependence of this rate coefficient is consistent with the Arrhenius equation, and find the best values for the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Rate coefficients measured experimentally at different temperatures.\n\n\ni (Expt.

In other words, does the Arrhenius expression accurately predict the value of the rate coefficient, \\(k\\), at each of the tempertures, \\(T\\), listed in Table 4.1. To answer this question, I can see that I’ll need to fit the Arrhenius expression to the experimental data and then assess the accuracy of the model.\nFrom the information provided in this chapter, I now that the most common way to fit the Arrhenius expression to experimental data is by using the linearized form shown in Equation 4.9. To do that, I’ll first need to convert the temperatures to absolute units. Then I can calculate the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experimental data point.\nIn general, when solving problems I like to start by listing the quantities whose values are given in the problem statement, assigning them to approprite variable symbols. In this problem I’m given several values of \\(T\\) and \\(k\\); I’ll underline these in my listing to indicate that they are vector quantities. I also like to list any relationships I’m provided. Here I’m told to use the Arrhenius expression, and since I now I’ll use the linearized form, I’ll list that.\n\n\n\nGiven and Known: \\(\\underline{T}\\) and \\(\\underline{k}\\).\nModel:\n\\[\n\\ln{k} = E \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right) + \\ln{k_0} \\tag{1}\n\\]\nDefining \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) as shown in equations (2) and (3) shows that equation (1) has the linear form shown in equation (4) when the slope, \\(m\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), are defined as in equations (5) and (6).\n\\[\ny = \\ln{k} \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\left( \\frac{-1}{RT} \\right) \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = m x + b \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\nm = E \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nb = \\ln{k_0} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nAfter converting the temperatures to K, \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) can be computed for each experiment using equations (2) and (3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I need to fit equation (4) to the data. This can be done using a spreadsheet program. The original data would first be entered in two columns, then new columns would be added for \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Those columns would the be plotted as a \\(x-y\\) scatterplot. Adding a linear trendline will fit equation (4) to the data, and in most spreadsheets the equation can be displayed on the graph along with the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). I would also like the undertainty in the values of the slope, \\(E\\), and intercept, \\(\\ln{k_0}\\). The way those are calculated will depend upon the specific spreadsheet program being used.\nAn alternative approach is to simply use linear least squares software to do the fitting and then plotting the results.\n\n\n\nUsing linear least squares software, the following Arrhenius parameter values were estimated: \\(k_0\\) = 6.97 x 106 L mol-1 min-1, 95% CI [1.01 x 106, 4.79 x 107] and \\(E\\) = 57.3 kJ mol-1, 95% CI [52, 62.5]. The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), was found to equal 0.992. The results were used to generate the model plot shown in Figure 4.5.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Arrhenius plot comparing the model (line) to the experimental data (points).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing I need to do is to assess the accuracy of the resulting Arrhenius expression. The criteria for assessing the accuracy were presented earlier in this chapter.\n\n\n\nThe uncertainty in \\(k_0\\), that is the difference between the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval, is 4.69 x 107 L mol-1 min-1. This is quite large compared to the estimated value of \\(k_0\\), 6.97 x 106 L mol-1 min-1. Estimated pre-exponential factors are often found to have large uncertainties. The uncertainty in the activation energy is 10.5 kJ mol-1 (18%) compared to the estimated value of 57.3 kJ mol-1. The coefficient of determination is quite close to 1.0, however, and the model plot shows good agreement between the experimental data and the model with no trends in the deviations. Overall, it appears that the experimental data are consistent with the Arrhenius expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example illustrated the preferred way to report a value together with its 95% confidence interval: “value units, 95% CI [lower bound, upper bound],” Thus \\(E\\) = 57.3 kJ mol-1, 95% CI [52, 62.5] means that the estimated value of \\(E\\) is 57.3 kJ mol-1, and if the experiments were repeated many times, 95% of those times the estimated value of \\(E\\) would be between 52 kJ mol-1 and 62.5 kJ mol-1."

    "section": "5.1 Reaction Mechanisms",
    "text": "5.1 Reaction Mechanisms\nUnderstanding the mechanism of a non-elementary reaction can be useful in a number of ways. Often reaction mechanisms are studied with the intention of using that knowledge to modify the reactive process. Because the intermediate species in a reaction mechanism are not readily observable using typical analysis instruments, the experimental study of mechanisms is demanding. Reaction Engineering Basics does not touch upon the experimental study of reaction mechanisms. Its focus with respect to mechanisms is on generating apparent rate expressions for non-elementary reactions given either a proposed mechanism or a mechanism that is well-established by experimental study.\nThe species that participate in a reaction mechanism but do not appear in the reaction expression for the non-elementary reaction are called reactive intermediates. The concentrations of reactive intermediates are always very small. Otherwise they would be observed at the macroscopic level. The reason reactive intermediates have small concentrations is that they react quickly making their lifetimes very short. That’s why they are called reactive intermediates. The identification of reactive intermediates when solving problems involving mechanisms is illustrated in every example at the end of this chapter.\nBy definition, every reaction in a reaction mechanism is an elementary reaction. Consequently, the rate expression for each mechanistic step will have the functional form shown in Equation 4.16, or for gases, in Equation 4.17. Those equations include the equilibrium constant for the elementary step. Very often in the case of mechanistic steps, thermodynamic data are not available for the reactive intermediates. In those cases, the equilibrium constant for the mechanistic step won’t be known. For this reason, in this chapter the rate expressions for elementary mechanistic steps will be written as shown in Equation 5.1, and the reverse rate coefficients treated as kinetics parameters. The square brackets in that equation can represent concentrations or (if the reagents are gases) partial pressures. When writing the rate expressions in this way, it is important to remember that the forward and reverse rate coefficients must be consistent with thermodynamics. The use of Equation 5.1 when solving problems involving mechanisms also is illustrated in every example at the end of this chapter.\n\\[\nr_j = k_{j,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}} - k_{j,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{\\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},j}}\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j\\) denotes a step in a reaction mechanism,\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the reactants in step \\(j\\), and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the products in step \\(j\\).\nThere are a few rules that all mechanisms must obey. There must be some linear combination of the mechanistic steps that exactly equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Being elementary reactions, every step in a reaction mechanism must be reversible. This is required by the principle of microscopic reversibility. In addition, the mechanistic steps must be consistent with all available experimental data including (isotopic effects, isotope distributions in products, spectroscopic measurements, etc.) and not just the reaction kinetics.\nReaction mechanisms are sometimes differentiated as having either an open sequence of steps or a closed sequence. Mechanisms with a closed sequence of steps are commonly referred to as chain reaction mechanisms. The distinguishing feature of a chain reaction mechanism is that it includes elementary steps known as propagation steps. A propagation step is a step wherein one reactive intermediate participates as a reactant and another reactive intermediate is formed as a product. The full set of propagation steps in the mechanism forms a closed sequence where each reactive intermediate is produced in one propagation step and consumed in a different propagation step. In a chain reaction mechanism, the apparent, non-elementary reaction is, in fact, a linear combination of the full set of propagation steps. As a consequence, propagation steps occur many, many more times than the other steps in the mechanism.\nHBr synthesis, Equation 5.2, is a non-elementary reaction. The HBr synthesis mechanism, Equations 5.3 through 5.6, is a classic example of a chain reaction mechanism. Notice that reactions 5.4 and 5.5 each consume one reactive intermediate and generate a different reactive intermediate. This makes reactions 5.4 and 5.5 propagation steps. More specifically, reaction 5.4 consumes a Br· reactive intermediate and generates an H· reactive intermediate. Then reaction 5.5 consumes an H· reactive intermediate and generates a Br· reactive intermediate. Adding just these two propagation steps together yields the apparent, non-elementary reaction 5.2.\n\\[\nH_2 + Br_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 HBr\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\n\\[\nBr_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 Br \\cdot\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\n\\[\nBr \\cdot + H_2 \\rightleftarrows HBr + H \\cdot\n\\tag{5.4}\\]\n\\[\nH \\cdot + Br_2 \\rightleftarrows HBr + Br \\cdot\n\\tag{5.5}\\]\n\\[\n2 H \\cdot \\rightleftarrows H_2\n\\tag{5.6}\\]\nWhile the sum of the two propagation steps, 5.4 and 5.5, equals the apparent non-elementary reaction, the other steps are still needed. This can be seen by noting that if neither reaction 5.3 nor reaction 5.6 ever occurred, then there would not be any reactive intermediates present, and that would mean that the propagation steps could not occur. In theory, either reaction 5.3, in the forward direction, or reaction 5.6, in the reverse direction, would need to occur at least one time in order to get the propagation sequence going. Steps 5.4 and 5.5 could then occur over and over until all of the Br2 or all of the H2 was used up. At that point, reaction 5.3, in the reverse direction, or reaction 5.6, in the forward direction, would need to occur one time to use up the reactive intermediates.\nReactions 5.3 and 5.6 are examples of two additional kinds of steps found in chain reaction mechanisms. These kinds of steps are known as initiation steps and termination steps. An elementary initiation step does not have a reactive intermediate as a reactant, but it generates one or more reactive intermediates as products. Similarly, termination steps consume reactive intermediates without producing any new ones. As noted above, even though initiation and termination steps only need to occur a small number of times compared to the propagation steps they are still a necessary kind of elementary reaction step for a chain reaction mechanism.\nIt has already been noted that every elementary reaction must be reversible. As such, the definitions just given for initiation and termination steps don’t make much sense because the reverse of any initiation step will be a termination step by definition, and similarly, the reverse of any termination step will be an initiation step. It is perhaps better to refer to them as initiation/termination steps. Usually, when one says that a step is an initiation step, what is meant is that the step in the forward direction, as written, is an initiation step. Commonly, the mechanistic steps corresponding to an apparent, non-elementary reaction will be written so that the reactants in the initiation step are also reactants in the apparent, non-elementary reaction.\nChain transfer steps can also appear in chain reaction mechanisms. These steps are common in free radical polymerization mechanisms. In free radical polymerization, a very long hydrocarbon molecule (the so-called chain) has a free radical at one end. Monomer molecules react with the free radical end of the growing polymer chain, with the net result that the chain is longer by one monomer unit and still has a free radical at the end. In a chain transfer step, a monomer adds to the end of a growing polymer chain, but the free radical transfers to a different molecule. That is, a chain transfer step terminates one growing chain and starts a new one.\nYet another type of step in chain reactions is known as a chain branching step. Chain branching steps must be kept under control; if they are not controlled, they can lead to explosions. In an elementary chain branching step, one reactive intermediate is consumed, but two new reactive intermediates are generated. Clearly if these steps get out of control, the number of reactive intermediates will increase geometrically. This, coupled with the fact that reactive intermediates are so highly reactive, is why explosions can result from uncontrolled chain branching steps.\nIf it is not possible to identify propagation steps in a reaction mechanism, then the mechanism consists of an open sequence of reaction steps. Open sequence mechanisms are a little less common than closed sequences. The reason has to do with the energy required for a reaction to take place. If, for example, in a chain reaction mechanism, the initiation step requires a significant energy input, but the propagation steps do not, the apparent, non-elementary reaction is able to proceed with relative ease because the initiation step only needs to occur a small number of times. In contrast, if one step in an open sequence of steps requires a significant energy input, that amount of energy will be required every time the apparent, non-elementary reaction takes place.\nReagents participate in a chemical reaction according to a fixed stoichiometry. For example every time one H2 molecule participates in reaction 5.2, one Br2 molecules also participates and two HBr molecules are produced. The propagation steps in a chain reaction mechanism, and all of the steps in an open sequence reaction mechanism, must obey a similar kind of stoichiometry. For example, each time the apparent, non-elementary HBr synthesis reaction occurs, each of the propagation steps, 5.4 and 5.5, must occur one time. The stoichiometric number, \\(\\sigma_j\\), of mechanistic step \\(j\\) (not to be confused with a stoichiometric coefficient, \\(\\nu_{i,j}\\)) is defined as the number of times mechanistic step \\(j\\) must occur when the apparent, non-elementary reaction occurs one time. Put differently, in the linear combination of the mechanistic steps that equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction, the coefficient that multiplies each mechanistic step is the stoichiometric number of that step. Thus, the stoichiometric numbers of steps 5.4 and 5.5 are each equal to 1. For some steps in a reaction mechanism, it is not possible to assign a unique stoichiometric number. For example, the initiation and terminations steps above, reactions 5.3 and 5.6, do not have unique stoichiometric numbers.\nIdentifying the types of reactions in a chain reaction mechanism and ensuring that the mechanism satisfies the rule that there must be some linear combination of the mechanistic steps that exactly equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction is illustrated in Example 5.3.1."

    "text": "5.2 Generating Rate Expressions from Mechanisms\nOnce a proposed mechanism has been checked to make sure it obeys the rules given above, it can be used to generate an expression for the apparent rate of generation of a reactant or product in the corresponding non-elementary reaction. Specifically, the apparent net rate of generation of species \\(i\\) in the overall macroscopically observed reaction, \\(j\\), will be the sum of its rates of generation in each of the mechanistic steps. That is, the apparent rate of generation of \\(i\\) via the non-elementary reaction, \\(j\\), is given by Equation 5.7. Because the steps are elementary, their rates are given by Equation 5.1, leading to Equation 5.8 as the expression for the apparent rate of generation of \\(i\\) via non-elementary reaction \\(j\\). In Reaction Engineering Basics, such rate expressions are referred to as mechanistic rate expressions. Examples 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5 illustrate the use of Equations 5.7 and 5.8 in problems involving the generation of a rate expression from a mechanism.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} =\\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.7}\\]\n\\[\nr_{i,j} = \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\left(k_{j^\\prime,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,j^\\prime}} - k_{j^\\prime,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{\\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},j^\\prime}} \\right)\n\\tag{5.8}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i\\) is a reactant or product in the non-elementary reaction \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the steps in the mechanism for non-elementary\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\) reaction \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the reactants in mechanistic step \\(j^\\prime\\), and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the products in mechanistic step \\(j^\\prime\\).\nIt is important to note that \\(i\\) in Equations 5.7 and 5.8, can be any reactant or product in the apparent, non-elementary reaction, \\(j\\). The resulting rates of generation of reagent \\(i\\) via non-elementary reaction \\(j\\) will all be stoichiometrically equivalent.\nGenerally Equation 5.8 leads to a mechanistic rate expression that is not very useful for reaction engineering purposes. Specifically, the resulting mechanistic rate expression will contain several terms, and it will include concentrations of reactive intermediates. The latter are present in a real system in very small concentrations. These concentrations are typically unknown, and they are very difficult to measure accurately. That makes it difficult to use a mechanistic rate expression in its initial form and makes it desirable to simplify it and eliminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from it. Simplification is accomplished by making different assumptions. Of course, the resulting simplified rate expression will only be valid if the assumptions are valid and if the underlying mechanism is correct.\nIt is sometimes observed that the rate of one particular mechanistic step has virtually no effect upon the apparent rate of the macroscopically observed reaction. Steps of this kind can be referred to as kinetically insignificant steps. This leads to an assumption that can be used to simplify a mechanistic rate expression. If a mechanistic step is assumed to be kinetically insignificant, its rate can be set equal to zero as shown in Equation 5.9. Example 5.3.2 shows the use of Equation 5.9 during the generation of mechanistic rate expression.\n\\[\nr_{j,\\text{insig}} = 0\n\\tag{5.9}\\]\nSimilarly, it is sometimes observed that the rate in the reverse direction of a particular step is very small compared to its forward rate or that the step is thermodynamically able to go essentially to completion. In other words, it is an effectively irreversible step. If a mechanistic step is assumed to be effectively irreversible, the term corresponding to its rate in the reverse direction in Equation 5.1, is set equal to zero as shown in Equation 5.10. Examples 5.3.1, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5 illustrate the use of Equation 5.10.\n\\[\nr_{j,\\text{irrev}} = k_{j,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime} \\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,j}}\n\\tag{5.10}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the reactants in mechanistic step \\(j\\).\n\n5.2.1 The Bodenstein Steady State Approximation\nBodenstein, M. and Lind, S. C. (1907) suggested an assumption related to reactive intermediates appearing in a reaction mechanism. As noted previously, reactive intermediates will be present at very low concentrations. This is a consequence of their high reactivity. As the reaction begins, the concentration of these species increases, but because they are so reactive, those intermediates formed undergo subsequent reaction very rapidly. In this way a steady state is quickly established whereby the rate at which reactive intermediates are being formed equals the rate at which they are undergoing subsequent reaction. Hence their concentration becomes constant and the overall rate of generation of the reactive intermediates becomes equal to zero. When the concentration of a species does not change over time, that concentration is said to be at steady state. For reactive intermediates, one can assume that this steady state condition always exists, ignoring the brief time required for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates to build up to their steady state values. This is known as the Bodenstein steady state approximation. To apply the steady state approximation, the rate of generation of each reactive intermediate via the non-elementary reaction is set equal to zero, as shown in Equation 5.11. Examples 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.4, and 5.3.5 illustrate the use the Bodenstein steady state approximation in problems involving the generation of a rate expression from a mechanism.\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{RI,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.11}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the steps in the reaction mechanism.\nIf there are \\(N\\) reactive intermediates in the mechanism, then Equation 5.11 can be used once for each intermediate. This results in a set of \\(N\\) algebraic equations. This set of \\(N\\) equations can be solved for the concentrations of the \\(N\\) reactive intermediates in terms of the rate coefficients in the mechanism and the concentrations of stable species such as the reactants and products of the apparent, non-elementary reaction. The resulting expressions for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates can be substituted back into the mechanistic rate expression from Equation 5.8. After doing so, the mechanistic rate expression for the apparent, non-elementary reaction will no longer contain concentrations of reactive intermediates, and it will be much more useful for reaction engineering purposes. This process is illustrated in Examples 5.3.4 and 5.3.5.\n\n\n5.2.2 Rate Determining Step\nSometimes one step in the mechanism is much more difficult or demanding than any of the other steps. This step introduces a bottleneck in the reaction kinetics; if the rate of this one step were somehow increased, the net rates of all the other steps and the observed overall rate would increase proportionally. This kind of step is referred to as a rate-determining step or a rate-limiting step. In situations where there is a rate-determining step, the rate expression can often be simplified considerably by making the assumption that the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction, \\(r_j\\), is equal to the rate of the rate-determining step, \\(r_{rds}\\), as shown in Equation 5.12. Note that \\(r_j\\) in Equation 5.12 is the apparent general rate of the non-elementary reaction, \\(j\\); it is not a species generation rate. It is important to recognize that not all mechanisms have a rate-determining step. The assumption of a rate-determining step during the generation of a rate expression from a mechanism is illustrated in Examples 5.3.3, 5.3.6, and 5.3.7.\n\\[\nr_j = r_{rds} = k_{rds,f} \\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime \\right]^{-\\nu_{i^\\prime,rds}} - k_{rds,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{\\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},rds}}\n\\tag{5.12}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the reactants in the rate-determining step and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the products in the rate-determining step.\nIt is often stated that the rate determining step is the slowest step in the mechanism, but this is not an accurate statement. When the steps all have the same stoichiometric number (see above), then every step in the mechanism proceeds at the same net rate. If the rate determining step was much slower than the steps before it, then the concentrations of the reactants of the rate-determining step would continually build up. Eventually, the concentrations of the reactants of the rate-determining step would become sufficiently large to be observed macroscopically. At that point, it would no longer appear from a macroscopic perspective, that only the non-elementary reaction was taking place. It is more accurate to say that the rate-determining step is the kinetic bottleneck or that it is the most demanding step, than to incorrectly state that it is the slowest step. Its rate determines the rates of all the other mechanistic steps.\nThe concept of one step being more difficult or demanding can be put in more scientific terms. Recall that multiplying each mechanistic step by its stoichiometric number and summing yields the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Since free energy is a state function, the sum of the free energy change for each mechanistic step multiplied by the stoichiometric number of that step is equal to the free energy change for the apparent, non-elementary reaction, as expressed in Equation 5.13. If there is one mechanistic step wherein essentially all of the overall free energy change takes place, that one step is the rate-determining step, Equation 5.14. Since essentially all of the free energy change occurs in the rate-determining step, the free energy change for the other steps is essentially zero, Equation 5.15. Note, again, that there does not have to be a rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism.\n\\[\n\\Delta G_j = \\sum_{j^\\prime} \\sigma_{j^\\prime} \\Delta G_{j^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.13}\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta G_j = \\sigma_{rds} \\Delta G_{rds}\n\\tag{5.14}\\]\n\\[\n\\Delta G_{nrd} \\approx 0\n\\tag{5.15}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the steps in the mechanism for non-elementary\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\) reaction \\(j\\)\nIf a rate-determining step exists for a particular reaction mechanism, there is another consequence. Since the free energy changes for all steps other than the rate-determining step are essentially zero, it may be assumed that all steps other than the rate-determining step reach a state of quasi-equilibrium. (Recall from thermodynamics that by definition, the free energy change for a process at thermodynamic equilibrium is equal to zero.) This is expressed in Equation 5.16.\n\\[\nK_{nrd} = \\prod_i \\left[i\\right]^{\\nu_{i,nrd}}\n\\tag{5.16}\\]\nNote that the rate expression that results from the application of Equation 5.12 is likely to include the concentration of one or more reactive intermediates, and if it does, it is not suitable for many reaction engineering purposes. In those cases, however, the quasi-equilibration assumption, Equation 5.16, can be applied to all other steps. The resulting equilibrium expressions can be solved for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates in terms of the concentrations of the reactants, products and the equilibrium constants for the steps other than the rate-determining step. Upon substitution into Equation 5.12, a rate expression more suitable for reaction engineering purposes results. The use of the assumption that steps other than the rate-determining step are quasi-equilibrated is illustrated in Examples 5.3.3, 5.3.6, and 5.3.7.\nRate expressions that are derived with the assumption of a rate-determining step will only apply for environmental conditions that are far from equilibrium. Recall that the free energy change due to the rate-determining step is equal to the overall free energy change. However, as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium the overall free energy change approaches zero (by definition) and the free energy change for every step approaches zero (according to the principle of microscopic reversibility). Thus, as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium it is no longer possible to identify a rate-determining step, and as a consequence, rate expressions that are derived with the assumption of a rate-determining step will only apply for environmental conditions that are far from equilibrium.\n\n\n5.2.3 Homogeneous Catalytic and Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms\nRecall that a catalyst is a material that causes the rate of one or more chemical reactions to increase, but the catalyst itself is not a reactant or product of the apparent non-elementary reaction. In some cases, the catalyst is present within the same phase as the reacting fluid. In this case the catalyst is referred to as a homogeneous catalyst. For present purposes, an enzyme may be considered to be a homogeneous catalyst for biological reactions, and for the remainder of this sub-section any discussion concerning catalysts also applies to enzymes unless noted otherwise.\nIn mechanisms for catalytic reactions, the catalyst appears in several different chemical forms. That is, some of the catalyst will be free (not bonded to anything), while some catalyst will be complexed (chemically bound) with reactants, products, or other species. Each of the chemical forms of the catalyst can be treated as a reactive intermediate because it appears in the reaction mechanism, but not in the apparent, non-elementary reaction. The concentrations of the various chemical forms of the catalyst can be difficult to measure, making it desirable to eliminate them from mechanistic rate expressions using either the steady-state approximation or, when there is rate-determining step in the mechanism, quasi-equilibrium assumptions.\nThe presence of a catalyst leads to an additional complication when simplifying a mechanistic rate expression. When the Bodenstein steady state approximation is applied to each of the chemical forms of the catalyst, it is found that the resulting equations cannot be solved to obtain expressions for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates as is done for non-catalytic mechanisms. The reason is that when the free catalyst and all the complexes it forms are treated as a reactive intermediates, the equations generated using the Bodenstein steady state approximation are not mathematically independent. One of the Bodenstein steady state equations must be replaced.\nThe equation that replaces one of the Bodenstein steady state equations is an expression for the conservation of catalyst. While the concentrations of the various chemical forms of the catalyst aren’t known, the total amount of catalyst originally added to the system usually is known, and it is a constant. Since catalyst is not generated nor consumed by reaction, the sum of the concentrations of all forms of the catalyst (free, reactant-complexed, intermediate-complexed, and product-complexed) must equal the known total concentration of catalyst. This is expressed in Equation 5.17 where \\(\\kappa_{i^\\prime}\\) is the number of catalyst species in the form originally added to the system that are needed to create one complex of the catalyst with species \\(i^\\prime\\). When one of the Bodenstein steady state equations is replaced by Equation 5.17, the resulting set of equations is mathematically independent. They can be solved to obtain expressions for the concentration of each reactive intermediate in terms of only rate coefficients, concentrations of stable species and the total concentration of the catalyst in its initial form, \\(C_{0,cat}\\). The amount of catalyst originally added to the system, \\(C_{0,cat}\\), is a known constant, so its presence in the rate expression is acceptable. The use of Equation 5.17 is illustrated in Examples 5.3.4 and 5.3.5.\n\\[\nC_{0,cat} = C_{cat,free} + \\sum_{i^\\prime}\\kappa_{i^\\prime}C_{i^\\prime}\n\\tag{5.17}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes all complexed forms of the catalyst.\nA similar complication can arise for either catalytic or non-catalytic reactions if the mechanism involves ionic species. In that case, similar to requiring the total amount of catalyst to be conserved, charge conservation must be enforced. If the reacting solution is uncharged, this means that the sum of the amounts of all positively charged species multiplied by their respective charges must equal the sum of the amounts of all negatively charged species multiplied by their respective charges, as expressed in Equation 5.18. That equation can then be used to replace one of the Bodenstein steady state equations, leading to a mathematically independent set of equations.\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{i+} C_{i+}q_{i+} + \\sum_{i-} C_{i-}q_{i-}\n\\tag{5.18}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i+\\) indexes the positively charged species in the system, and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i-\\) indexes the negatively charged species in the system.\nWhile enzyme catalysis and homogeneous chemical catalysis are the same in many respects, there are some differences. The term “substrate” is typically used instead of “reactant”. In catalytic systems, a reagent that binds with the catalyst and renders it catalytically inactive is called a catalyst poision. The equivalent in an enzymatic reaction is called an enzyme inhibitor. Typically an enzyme is a large molecule that has many twists and folds in its structure, and the catalysis associated with the enzyme takes place when the substrate binds to one particular location within the overall structure. Inhibitors are often molecules that also bind to the particular location where the catalysis takes place. When an inhibitor molecule is bound in this way, the enzyme becomes catalytically inactive until such time that the inhibitor releases from it. In addition to inhibition, some enzymes require cofactor molecules. A cofactor molecule is often a relatively small inorganic molecule that has the effect of activating an enzyme when it binds to it. That is, the enzyme alone is not active, but when a cofactor binds to it, it becomes catalytically active.\nIn terms of simplifying mechanistic rate expressions, the concentrations of poisons, inhibitors, and cofactors that are not complexed with a catalyst or enzyme is often easily measured. In this case, it is acceptable for reaction engineering purposes for the concentrations of uncomplexed poisons, inhibitors, and cofactors to appear in the rate expression for the apparent, non-elementary reaction. If, for some reason, the presence of these concentrations in the rate expression was undesirable, the poision, inhibitor, or cofactor could be treated as a conserved species. Doing so would lead to their total concentration appearing in the rate expression instead of the concentration of the uncomplexed form. In any case, it is not acceptable for the concentration of a poison, inhibitor or cofactor that is complexed to the catalyst to appear in the rate expression for the non-elementary reaction. Generation of a mechanistic rate expression when the mechanism includes an inhibitor is illustrated in Example 5.3.5.\n\n\n5.2.4 Heterogeneous Catalytic Reaction Mechanisms\nMany industrial processes utilize heterogeneous catalysts; they are a separate phase that is in contact with the reacting fluid. Most typically the catalyst is solid while the reagents are in a gaseous or liquid phase. The reaction actually takes place on the surface of the catalyst at specific locations called active sites. When writing a mechanistic step that involves an active site, it is common to use some type of star to represent the site, e. g. \\(\\ast\\). Reactants, intermediates and products can bond to these sites in much the same way as they can form complexes with homogeneous catalysts or enzymes. In heterogeneous catalysis, the bonding of a species in the reacting fluid phase to an active site on the surface of the catalyst is a process referred to as adsorption, and the surface complexes that are generated are called adsorbed species. The reverse process, where a species leaves the surface and enters the fluid phase is called desorption.\nIn simple situations, it is usually safe to assume that the total surface area of the heterogeneous catalyst remains constant during the course of the reaction. It can also be safely assumed that the number (and therefore the concentration) of active sites, \\(C_{\\text{sites}}\\), remains constant. Note that this is a two-dimensional concentration (sites per surface area) not a three-dimensional one (sites per volume). In heterogeneous catalytic kinetics, the concentration of an adsorbed species, \\(k\\) is usually expressed in terms of the fraction of the total sites that it covers, \\(\\theta_k\\). This quantity is then referred to as the fractional coverage or the surface coverage of surface species \\(k\\). When this is done, the concentration, \\(C_k\\) of any surface species adsorbed on a single site is given by Equation 5.19.\n\\[\nC_k = C_{\\text{sites}} \\theta_k\n\\tag{5.19}\\]\nTransition state theory can be used to derive the mathematical form of rate expressions for an elementary surface reaction. When this is done, the concentration of sites, \\(C_{\\text{sites}}\\), can be combined with the pre-exponential factor of the rate coefficient. After doing so, the resulting rate expression for an elementary surface reaction is given in Equation 5.20.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{j,f}\\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime  \\right]^{- \\nu_{i^\\prime,j}} \\prod_{k^\\prime}\\theta_{k^\\prime}^{- \\nu_{k^\\prime,j}} \\\\\n&- k_{j,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{ \\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},j} }\\prod_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}\\theta_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}^{ \\nu_{k^{\\prime\\prime},j}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.20}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the fliud phase reactants in step \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^\\prime\\) indexes the surface reactants in step \\(j\\),\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the fluid phase products in step \\(j\\), and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the surface products in step \\(j\\).\nNote that because the rate expression for a heterogeneous catalytic mechanistic step is different than those for non-catalytic, catalytic and enzymatic mechanistic steps, if there is a rate-determining step (rds) in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism, Equation 5.21 should be used in place of Equation 5.12 for the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction \\(j\\). Also, when equilibrium expressions are written for surface reactions, the fractional coverage of surface species replaces their concentration.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= r_{rds} \\\\\n&= k_{rds,f}\\prod_{i^\\prime}\\left[ i^\\prime  \\right]^{- \\nu_{i^\\prime,rds}} \\prod_{k^\\prime}\\theta_{k^\\prime}^{- \\nu_{k^\\prime,rds}} \\\\\n&- k_{rds,r}\\prod_{i^{\\prime\\prime}}\\left[ i^{\\prime\\prime} \\right]^{ \\nu_{i^{\\prime\\prime},rds} }\\prod_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}\\theta_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}^{ \\nu_{k^{\\prime\\prime},rds}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{5.21}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(i^\\prime\\) indexes the fliud phase reactants in the rds,\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^\\prime\\) indexes the surface reactants in the rds,\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(i^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the fluid phase products in the rds, and\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) \\(k^{\\prime\\prime}\\) indexes the surface products in the rds.\nFor reaction engineering purposes, it is not desirable to have a rate expression that contains surface coverages because they are typically unknown and difficult to measure. Therefore, the mechanistic rate expression is simplified using the Bodenstein steady state approximation or other valid assumptions. Similar to homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis, the heterogeneous catalytic sites are conserved, and one Bodenstein steady state equation must be replaced by an expression for the conservation of catalytic sites. In the case of heterogeneous catalysis, the conservation of catalytic sites takes the form shown in Equation 5.22.\n\\[\n1 = \\theta_{\\text{vacant}} + \\sum_k \\theta_k\n\\tag{5.22}\\]\nThe generation of a mechanistic rate expression from a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism is illustrated in Examples 5.3.6 and 5.3.7.\n\n\n5.2.5 Most Abundant Intermediate\nCatalytic reaction mechanisms (homogeneous, enzymatic or heterogeneous) are subtly different from non-catalytic reaction mechanisms. During non-catalytic reactions, the amount of every reactive intermediate is small. This makes their concentration difficult to measure, leading to the necessity to eliminate those concentrations from rate expressions for the non-elementary reaction. During catalytic reactions the total number of reactive intermediates is not necessarily small, it is determined by the amount of catalyst present. As a result, some of the intermediates in catalytic reactions will be present in significant amounts. Nonetheless, measuring the concentrations of those intermediates is still very difficult, so it is common to eliminate their concentrations from mechanistic rate expressions. That is, even though their concentration may be greater than reactive intermediates in non-catalytic reactions, the non-complexed catalyst and each complexed form of a catalyst or enzyme is treated as a reactive intermediate. This also applies to vacant sites and each adsorbed surface species in a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism.\nAs a consequence of the larger concentrations of catalytic intermediates, it is possible that during reaction, most of the catalyst, enzyme or catalyst sites are complexed with one reagent. If so, that complex is called the most abundant intermediate. Mathematically, when there is a most abundant intermediate, Equation 5.23 applies for a homogeneous catalytic or enzymatic mechanism and Equation 5.24 applies for a heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanism. These inequalities can sometimes lead to additional simplification of the apparent rate expression for the non-elementary reaction. This happens when the apparent rate expression has a denominator with several terms. When there is a most-abundant intermediate, some of the terms in these denominators may be much smaller than others and so can be deleted without affecting the accuracy of the rate expression. The simplification of a mechanistic rate expression when there is a most abundant intermediate in the mechanism is illustrated in Example 5.3.7.\n\\[\nC_{ma} \\gg C_{nma}\n\\tag{5.23}\\]\n\\[\n\\theta_{ma} \\gg \\theta_{nma}\n\\tag{5.24}\\]"

    "text": "5.3 Examples\nAll of the examples included in Chapter 5 can be classified as “mechanism problems.” Each example begins with a problem statement. Immediately following the problem statement there is a green “expert thinking” callout. like the one at the end of this paragraph. By default the content of these callouts is hidden. Clicking on the callout opens it and shows its content. The intention of these callouts is to provide some insight into what an expert might be thinking after reading the problem statement as they ponder how to solve the problem. To reduce the amount of duplication, the callout below presents general expert thinking that applies to every example in Chapter 5. The individual expert thinking callouts in each of the examples then provide thinking specific to that problem. In other words, the reader should mentally insert the content of this callout at the start of all of the remaining expert thinking callouts in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking after Reading each Problem Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I call a “mechanism problem.” Its characteristic features are that it identifies a non-elementary reaction, provides a mechanism for that reaction, and asks for an expression for the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction. I’ve learned that solving this type of problem has two parts. The first part is to express the apparent rate of the non-elementary reaction in terms of the rates of the steps in the mechanism. If there is a rate-determining step in the mechanism and there is not a heterogeneous catalyst, Equation 5.12 is used to do this. If there is a rate-determining step in the mechanism and there is a heterogeneous catalyst, Equation 5.21 is used. If there is not a rate-determining step, Equation 5.7 is used.\nThe second part involves eliminating concentrations of reactive intermediates, concentrations of catalyst complexes or heterogeneous catalyst surface coverages from the apparent rate expression. (Note in the present context, “catalyst complexes” includes the free catalyst as well as each of its complexed forms, and “surface species” includes the vacant site as well as each adsorbed species adsorbed on the surface.)\nIf (a) there is a rate-determining step in the mechanism, this is done by writing Equation 5.16 (quasi-equilibrium expressions) for all the other steps. If there is a homogeneous catalyst or an enzyme in the mechanism, Equation 5.17 is added to the set of quasi-equilibrium expressions. Alternatively, if there is a heterogeneous catalyst in the mechanism, Equation 5.22 is added to the set of quasi-equilibrium expressions.\nIf (b) there is not a rate-determining step, Equation 5.11 (the Bodenstein steady state approximation) is used to eliminate the concentrations of reactive intermediates, catalyst complexes or surface species coverages from the apparent rate expression. If the mechanism does not involve any type of catalyst or enzyme, Equation 5.11 is written for each reactive intermediate appearing in the reaction mechanism. If there is a homogeneous catalyst or an enzyme in the mechanism, Equation 5.11 is written for all but one catalyst complex and Equation 5.17 (the catalyst conservation expression) is added to the set of Bodenstein steady state expressions. If there is a heterogeneous catalyst in the mechanism, Equation 5.11 is written for all but one surface species and Equation 5.22 (the surface site conservation expression) is added to the set of Bodenstein steady state approximations.\nIn either case (a) or case (b), the resulting set of equations is then solved to obtain expressions for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates, the concentrations of the catalyst complexes, or the heterogeneous catalyst surface coverages. Then the results can be used to eliminate the concentrations of the reactive intermediates, catalyst complexes or surface coverages from the apparent rate expression.\n\n\n\nFollowing the expert thinking callout in each example, a concise formulation of the problem solution is presented. The formulations contain multiple instances of “where did that come from” callouts. By default, the contents of these callouts is also hidden. These callouts provide added detail about how the equations they follow were generated. The idea is that with the content of all of the callouts hidden, the reader can see the solution in a very concise format, but if the reader does not perceive where certain equations came from, they can open the corresponding callout to see more details.\n\n5.3.1 Validity, Classification of Steps and Mechanistic Rate Expression for a Chain Reaction Mechanism\nSuppose that nitrogen oxidation, equation (1), occurs via the chain reaction mechanism given in equations (2) through (5). Classify each of the mechanistic steps as initiation/termination, propagation, chain branching or chain transfer; show that there is a linear combination of equations (2) through (5) that is equal to equation (1); and write, but do not simplify, the expression for the apparent rate of non-elementary reaction (1) that is predicted by the mechanism. Discuss the suitability of the resulting rate expression for reaction engineering purposes.\n\\[\nN_2 + O_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 NO \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nO_2 \\rightleftarrows 2 O \\cdot \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nO \\cdot + N_2 \\rightleftarrows NO + N \\cdot \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nN \\cdot + O_2 \\rightleftarrows NO + O \\cdot \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 N \\cdot \\rightleftarrows N_2\\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a mechanism problem. The problem asks me to classify each step in the mechanism. I can do that knowing that initiation steps have no reactive intermediates as reactants and one or more reactive intermediates as products, while termination steps have one or more reactive intermediates as reactants and no reactive intermediates as products. Propagation steps have one reactive intermediate among the reactants and a different reactive intermediate among the products. Chain branching steps have one reactive intermediate among the reactants and two reactive intermediates among the products. Chain transfer steps are usually found in polymerization reactions, so I don’t expect to find any chain transfer steps in this mechanism.\nThe problem next asks me to show that there is a linear combination of the steps that equals the apparent, non-elementary reaction. I know that in chain mechanisms that linear combination usually involves only the propagation steps. For simple mechanisms like those considered in Reaction Engineering Basics, the necessary linear combination can usually be found by inspection.\nFinally, the problem asks me to write the generalized rate expression predicted by the mechanism. This mechanism does not have a rate-determining step, so I’ll set the rate of generation of a reactant or product in the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of its rates of generation in the mechanistic steps. In order to do that I need to identify the reactive intermediates. The reactive intermediates are the reagents that appear in one or more mechanistic steps, but they do not appear in the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Here I can see that N2, O2, and NO appear in the apparent, non-elementary reaction, so they are not reactive intermediates. The only other reagents that I see in the mechanism (reactions (2) through (5)) are N∙ and O∙, so they are the reactive intermediates.\n\n\n\nInitiation/Termination Steps: Steps (2) and (5)\nPropagation Steps: Steps (3) and (4)\nBy inspection it can be seen that adding steps (3) and (4) yields the apparent, non-elementary reaction, reaction (1).\nReactive Intermediates: \\(N \\cdot\\), \\(O \\cdot\\)\nApparent Rate Expression\nSetting the apparent rate of generation of NO in the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of its rates of generation in each of the mechanistic steps yields equation (6).\n\\[\nr_{NO,1} = r_3 + r_4 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart from Equation 5.7.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} =\\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\nI’ve chosen to generate an expression for the apparent generation of NO in the non-elementary reaction (1), so \\(i = NO\\) and \\(j = 1\\).

When writing those mole and energy balances, the reaction engineer will not know the reaction mechanism; the reaction engineer will only know that reaction (1) takes place and that equation (10) is the rate expression for reaction (1).\nThe mole and energy balances will include variables for the amounts of N2, O2, and NO, but they will not include variables for the amounts of N∙ and O∙. Furthermore, there is no way to calculate the concentrations of N∙ and O∙ because they are not stoichiometrically related to the concentrations of N2, O2, and NO. Without concentrations of N∙ and O∙, it is not possible to evaluate the reaction rate, and consequently the reaction engineer will not be able to solve the mole and energy balances on the reactor.\nFor this reason, the initial form of rate expressions generated from mechanisms is not useful for reaction engineering purposes. In order to perform reaction engineering tasks, the rate expression must be simplified so that it does not contain concentrations of reactive intermediates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction engineer could use an alternative approach if the mechanism was known. Instead of assuming that only the apparent, non-elementary reaction takes place, the reaction engineer could assume that reactions (2) through (5) occur in the reactor. In that case, the mole and energy balances would include variables for the amounts of the reactive intermediates and it would be possible to evaluate the rates of the reactions.\nHowever, that approach introduces a different problem. If the mechanistic reactions are used, the rate expressions for each of the mechanistic steps are needed. That means, for example, that experiments would need to be performed to find the values of \\(k_{3,f}\\), and \\(k_{3,r}\\) in equation (7). Performing those experiments would require setting and/or measuring the concentrations of N∙ and O∙. Because N∙ and O∙ are highly reactive, setting and measuring their concentrations is very difficult. In other words, the difficult and demanding task of estimating the values of the kinetics parameters in the mechanistic rate expressions would be necessary if the reaction engineer opted for this alternative approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Mechanistic Rate Expression for HBr Synthesis using the Bodenstein Steady State Approximation\nIn the mechanism for synthesis of HBr given below, assume step (4) is effectively irreversible and step (5) is kinetically insignificant. Use the Bodenstein steady-state approximation to derive a mechanistic rate expression for the apparent rate of generation of HBr via non-elementary reaction (1). Simplify the mechanism so that it contains only partial pressures of stable species and not those of reactive intermediates.

I see that H2, Br2, and HBr all appear in the apparent, non-elementary reaction. Looking at the mechanism proposed in reactions (2) through (5), I see that H∙ and Br∙ also appear, so they are the reactive intermediates.\nThis mechanism does not include a rate-determining step, so I will use Equation 5.7 to write the rate of generation of a reactant or product in the non-elementary reaction in terms of the rates of the mechanistic steps. The problem asks for an expression for the rate of generation of HBr, so I’ll write the rate expression for HBr.\nI know that when the mechanism does not have a rate-determining step, the Bodenstein steady state approximation, Equation 5.11, must be used to eliminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from the rate expression for the non-elementary reaction.\n\n\n\nReactive Intermediates: H∙ and Br∙\nNecessary Equations\nThe apparent rate of generation of HBr via the non-elementary reaction (1) is the sum of its rates of generation in the mechanistic steps, equation (6)\n\\[\nr_{HBr,1} = r_3 + r_4 \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there isn’t a rate-determining step, start with Equation 5.7.\n\\[\nr_{i,j} =\\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\nI want an expression for the apparent rate of generation of HBr by reaction (1), so \\(i = HBr\\) and \\(j = 1\\).

Substitution of those results into the rate expression yields a mechanistic rate expression for the apparent rate of generation of HBr via non-elementary reaction (1), as shown in equation (15).\n\\[\n\\left[ Br \\cdot \\right] = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\sqrt{\\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left[ H \\cdot \\right] = \\frac{k_{3,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\sqrt{\\left[ Br_2 \\right]}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{k_{3,r}\\left[ HBr\\right] + k_{4,f}\\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{HBr,1} = 2\\frac{k_{3,f}k_{4,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\left[ Br_2 \\right]^{3/2}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{k_{3,r}\\left[ HBr\\right] + k_{4,f}\\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{15}\n\\]\nBefore the rate expression in equation (15) could be used, it would be necessary to estimate the values of the kinetics parameters appearing in it. Using experimental data where the concentrations or partial pressures of H2, Br2 and HBr were varied and the corresponding values of the rate were measured, it would not be possible to obtain unique values for each of the five rate coefficients. This can be seen most easily by dividing the numerator and denominator of equation (15) by \\(k_{4,f}\\) as shown in equation (16).\n\\[\nr_{HBr,1} = 2\\frac{k_{3,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\left[ Br_2 \\right]^{3/2}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{\\frac{k_{3,r}}{k_{4,f}}\\left[ HBr\\right] + \\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{16}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(k_{2,f}\\), \\(k_{2,r}\\), and \\(k_{3,f}\\) do not appear individually in the rate expression. They only appear together as the term, \\(k\\), defined in equation (17). Similarly, \\(k_{3,r}\\) and \\(k_{4,f}\\) do not appear individually, but only together as the term, \\(k^\\prime\\), defined in equation (18). Consequently, the rate expression can be written as shown in equation (19).\n\\[\nk = k_{3,f}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{2,f}}{k_{2,r}}} \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\nk^\\prime = \\frac{k_{3,r}}{k_{4,f}} \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{HBr,1} = 2\\frac{k \\left[ Br_2 \\right]^{3/2}\\left[ H_2\\right]}{k^\\prime\\left[ HBr\\right] + \\left[ Br_2 \\right]} \\tag{19}\n\\]\nStatistical parameter estimation methods can be employed to find unique “best” values for \\(k\\) and \\(k^\\prime\\). Looking at equation (17), it can be seen that arbitrary values can be selected for any two of the three rate coefficients, \\(k_{2,f}\\), \\(k_{2,r}\\), and \\(k_{3,f}\\). As long as the value of the third rate coefficient was chosen so that \\(k\\) was equal to its “best” value, the rate expression in equation (16) would be equally accurate. Thus, \\(k_{2,f}\\), \\(k_{2,r}\\), and \\(k_{3,f}\\) are coupled. An infinite number of sets of values could be used and the accuracy of the rate expression would not change. The rate coefficients, \\(k_{3,r}\\) and \\(k_{4,f}\\), are similarly coupled. Whenever possible, coupled kinetics parameters in mechanistic rate expressions should be combined into a single parameter for which a unique value can be estimated. Put differently, for reaction engineering purposes, rate expression (19) is preferred over rate expression (16).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coupled rate coefficients in this problem appeared in a term where they were multiplied, divided and raised to a constant power (here, the power was 1/2 corresponding to the square root). When rate coefficients are combined in this way, the combined parameters, \\(k\\) and \\(k^\\prime\\) in this case, will display Arrhenius temperature dependence and long as the original rate coefficients did so.\nIf rate coefficients are added or subtracted, this will not be true. That is, if \\(k = k_1 + k_2\\), the combined rate coefficient \\(k\\) will not display Arrhenius temperature dependence, even if \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) each do display Arrhenius temperature dependence.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Mechanistic Rate Expression from a Mechanism with a Rate-Determining Step\nSuppose that iodopropane disproportionates to produce iodine according to the apparent non-elementary reaction (1).

If the mechanism consists of reactions (2) and (3), derive a mechanistic rate expression for the apparent generation of P via reaction (1) assuming step (3) is effectively irreversible. The resulting rate expression should be suitable for reaction engineering purposes. That is, it should not contain concentrations of reactive intermediates.\n\\[\nS \\rightleftarrows P \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nE + S \\rightleftarrows E\\!\\!-\\!\\!S \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nE\\!\\!-\\!\\!S \\rightleftarrows E + P \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a mechanism problem. There isn’t a rate-determining step in the mechanism, but it does involve an enzyme. In problems with enzymes (or with homogeneous catalysts), each form of the enzyme is treated the same way reactive intermediates are treated, so for this problem the reactive intermediates are the free (uncomplexed) enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex.\nSince there isn’t a rate-determining step, I will need to choose a reagent in the non-elementary reaction and set the apparent rate of generation of that reagent via the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of the rates at which it is generated in each mechanistic step. In this problem, I’ll do this for the product, P, since it only appears in one step in the mechanism.\nThere are two reactive intermediates, but if I wrote the Bodenstein steady state approximation for both of them, the equations would not be mathematically independent because the mechanism includes an enzyme. I know that in this situation I need to write the Bodenstein steady state approximation for all but one of the reactive intermediates and then add an equation for the conservation of catalyts. Those equations can be solved to obtain expressions for the concentrations of the reactive intermediates that can be used to eliminate the reactive intermediate concentrations from the rate expression.\n\n\n\nReactive Intermediates: E and E-S\nNecessary Equations\nSetting the apparent rate of generation of P via reaction (1) equal to the sum of its rates of generation in each of the mechanistic steps yields equation (4).\n\\[\nr_{P,1} = r_3 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 5.7. \\[\nr_{i,j} =\\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}r_{j^\\prime}\n\\]\nHere I want an expression for the apparent generation of P via non-elementary reaction (1), so \\(i = P\\) and \\(j = 1\\).

They defined two kinetics parameters, \\(V_{max}\\) and \\(K_m\\), as shown in equations (12) and (13).

The parameters, \\(V_{max}\\) and \\(K_m\\), can be estimated using experimental kinetics data together with software for fitting non-linear models to data. Notice, however, that if the reciprocals of the two sides of the equation are set equal to each other as shown in equation (15), a linear model results. Specifically, defining \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) as shown in equations (16) and (17), it can be seen that the model has the linear form shown in equation (18) where the slope, \\(m\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), are given in equations (19) and (20).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r_{P,1}} = \\left( \\frac{K_m}{V_{max}}  \\right) \\frac{1}{\\left[ S \\right]} + \\frac{1}{V_{max}} \\tag{15}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{r_{P,1}} \\tag{16}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{\\left[ S \\right]} \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = mx + b \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nm = \\frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \\tag{19}\n\\]\n\\[\nb = \\frac{1}{V_{max}} \\tag{20}\n\\]\nAs was the case when the Arrhenius expression was linearized (see the note at the end of Example 4.5.4), a spreadsheet program could be used to create a plot of \\(\\frac{1}{r_{P,1}}\\) vs. \\(\\frac{1}{\\left[ S \\right]}\\). A plot of this type was used by Lineweaver and Burk (1934), and today plots of the type are commonly called Lineweaver-Burk plots. By adding a trendline to the Lineweaver-Burk plot, the best estimates for \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) will be obtained. As equation (20) shows, the best estimate for \\(V_{max}\\) is equal to the reciprocal of the best estimate for \\(b\\). Then, as equation (19) shows, the best estimate for \\(K_m\\) is equal to the best estimate for \\(m\\) multiplied by \\(V_{max}\\).\nIt can be noted in equation (13) that \\(K_m\\) includes the sum of two rate coefficients. As such, \\(K_m\\) will not display Arrhenius temperature dependence if it is measured over a sufficiently broad range of temperatures. Fortunately, enzymes are often active only in a narrow range of temperatures, and this does not become a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.5 Mechanistic Rate Expression from an Enzymatic Mechanism with an Inhibitor\nSuppose that enzyme E catalyzes the conversion of substrate S to product P, but if the reagent I is present in the system, it inhibits the enzyme. The apparent reaction is shown in equation (1), and the proposed mechanism consists of reactions (2) through (4).\n\\[\nS \\rightleftarrows P \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nE + S \\rightleftarrows E\\!\\!-\\!\\!S \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nE + I \\rightleftarrows E\\!\\!-\\!\\!I \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nE\\!\\!-\\!\\!S \\rightleftarrows E + P \\tag{4}\n\\]\nAssume that step (4) is effectively irreversible and derive a Michaelis-Menten type of rate expression for this system that is suitable for reaction engineering purposes (i. e. that does not contain concentrations of reactive intermediates). You may assume that the concentration of the free inhibitor can be easily measured, so that its presence in the rate expression is acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is again a mechanism problem that includes an enzyme and does not have a rate determining step. In mechanism problems that involve a homogeneous catalyst or an enzyme, the free and compelexed forms of the catalyst or enzyme are treated like reactive intermediates. Thus, in this problem the reactive intermediates are E, E-S and E-I.\nSince there isn’t a rate-determining step, I will choose a reagent from the apparent reaction and set its apparent rate of generation in the non-elementary reaction equal to the sum of its rates of generation in the mechanistic steps. Here I will do this for P because it only appear in one mechanistic step.\nTo eliminate the concentrations of reactive intermediates from the rate expressions, I’ll write the Bodenstein steady state approximation for two of the three reactive intermediates. The Bodenstein steady state approximation for the third reactive intermediate would not be mathematically independent, so I will replace it with an expression for the conservation of catalyst. The resulting set of three equations can be solved to obtain expressions for the concentrations of the three reactive intermediates.

    "section": "6.1 A Generic Reactor",
    "text": "6.1 A Generic Reactor\nThe four types of ideal reactors used in Reaction Engineering Basics, batch stirred-tank reactors (BSTRs), semi-batch stirred-tank reactors (SBSTRs), continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs), were briefly introduced in Chapter 1. Schematic diagrams of stirred tanks, Figure 1.3, and tubular reactors, Figure 1.4, were also presented. Each of these will be discussed in detail later in this chapter. To begin, however, a generic reactor (one that could be any one of those four ideal reactor types) is considered. Doing so helps identify the different kinds of variables needed to model a reactor as well as the equations that are used to describe the relationships between those variables.\n\n6.1.1 Variables Used When Modeling a Reactor\nBriefly, every ideal reactor has a compartment that contains reacting fluid. If the reacting fluid needs to be heated or cooled using a heat exchange fluid, the reactor will have a second compartment, as described in Appendix D. Depending on the specific physical structure of the reactor, the second compartment is sometimes referred to as the reactor shell or jacket, and the heat exchange fluid will be flowing through it. For short, it is called the exchange fluid because its purpose is to exchange heat with the reacting fluid. The exchange fluid is physically separated from the reacting fluid by a solid wall that prevents the two fluids from mixing. Heat is transferred through the wall separating the two reactor compartments.\nNote that the word “reactor” sometimes refers to the entire piece of equipment including both the compartment containing the reacting fluid and the shell. Other times “reactor” refers only to the compartment containing the reacting fluid. This is not likely to cause confusion; the meaning is usually clear from the context of the statement. The physico-chemical properties of the reacting fluid and the exchange fluid, that is their densities, heat capacities, etc., are needed when modeling a reactor. Consequently, fluid properties are one of the groups of variables that appear in the equations used to model a reactor.\nReactor input and reactor output were defined above as what goes into the reactor and what comes out of the reactor. These definitions work fine for the continuous flow reactors (CSTRs and PFRs) because they have fluid flowing into and out of them as they operate. It also works for the exchange fluid, if present, because it, too, is flowing into and out of the reactor as the reactor operates. However, for BSTRs and SBSTRs the meaning of reactor input and reactor output requires additional refinement. For BSTRs the reactor input refers to what is present within the reaction compartment just before the reactions begin, and BSTR output refers to what is present within the reaction compartment right after the reactions end. The same meanings for input and output apply to SBSTRs, but SBSTR input additionally includes fluid that flows into the reaction compartment while the reactions are taking place. Reaction Engineering Basics does not consider SBSTRs where reacting fluid flows out of the reactor while reactions are occurring.\nThe reactor input variables are related to the fluid present within the reactor just before reaction begins and/or the fluid flowing into the reactor as the reaction is occurring. The specific reactor input variables include the molar amount (or molar flow rate) of every reagent (including “inert” reagents that do not participate in reactions) in that fluid, the temperature, and the pressure of that fluid. In addition, the reactor input variables include the mass flow rate of the exchange fluid, and the inlet temperature of the exchange fluid.\nThe output molar amount (or molar flow rates) of every reagent, output temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, and the rate at which work is done by the reacting system on its surroundings make up the reactor output variables. There are two differences when compared to the reactor input variables. First, Reaction Engineering Basics assumes there is never accumulation of exchange fluid within the reactor. Consequently the outlet mass flow rate of the exchange fluid is always equal to its inlet mass flow rate. Since the exchange fluid mass flow rate is included among the reactor input variables, it is not included among the reactor output variables.\nThe other difference is work done by the reacting system on its surroundings. If the reactor has a moving boundary, such as a pistion, it is possible for the reactor to perform mechanical work on its surroundings. That work is included among the reactor output variables. This is important, for example, if the combustion chamber in an automobile engine is modeled as a chemical reactor. The reactors considered in Reaction Engineering Basics are typically vessels located in a chemical processing facility or laboratory. The only moving boundaries associated with those reactors is usually a shaft connected to an agitator that is used to mix the reagents. In all cases in Reaction Engineering Basics, the work associated with agitation of the fluid in a stirred tank is considered to be negligible.\nReactor parameters appear in the reactor model equations. They include the dimensions of the reactor (volume for stirred tanks or diameter and length for PFRs), the shell volume, the heat transfer area, the heat transfer coefficient, and some measure of the reaction time. If there is a packed bed of catalyst particles in the reactor, the bed porosity is also included with these parameters.\nThe reaction time can be characterized in different ways. For closed systems (BSTRs and SBSTRs) the reaction time variable is measured using clock time. It is the difference between the clock time when the reaction started and the clock time when it ended. It is customary to define an elapsed time, \\(t\\), as being equal to zero when the reaction starts, in which case the reaction time is equal to the elapsed time when the reaction stops.\nIn an open system (CSTRs and PFRs), reaction starts when the fliud enters the reactor and it ends when the fluid leaves the reactor. The reaction time then is equal to the amount of time the fluid spends in the reactor. On average, a fluid flowing into a reactor of volume, \\(V\\), at a volumetric flow rate of \\(\\dot V_{in}\\), is within the reactor for an amount of time, \\(\\tau\\), given by Equation 6.1. In reaction engineering, \\(\\tau\\) is given a special name; it is called the space time. The reciprocal of \\(\\tau\\) is called the space velocity. For open systems the space time can be used as a measure of the reaction time.\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{V}{\\dot V_{in}}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nThe elapsed time and the space time are explicit specifications of the reaction time. In some cases, the reaction time may be specified implicitly. For example, when a problem specifies the final amount of a reagent, that is an implicit specification of the reaction time. It means that the reaction proceeded for the length of time necessary for the amount of that reagent to change from its initial value to the specified final value.\nFinally, reaction properties include kinetics parameters and heats of reaction that appear in models of chemical reactors. Both fluid properties and reaction properties may vary as a function of temperature, pressure or composition. In those cases, equations for calculating the property must be available, and any constants that appear in those equations are included among the reaction and fluid properties. Table 6.1 summarizes the variable groups that are used when modeling an ideal reactor.\n\n\nTable 6.1: Variable Groups Used to Model an Ideal Reactor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nVariables\n\n\n\n\nReactor Input\nInput molar amounts (or molar flow rates) of every reagent present in the system, input temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, mass flow rate of the exchange fluid (if there is one), and inlet temperature of the exchange fluid, if there is one.\n\n\nReactor Output\nOutput molar amounts (or molar flow rates) of every reagent present in the system, output temperature and pressure of the reacting fluid, rate at which the reactor does mechanical work on its surroundings, and outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, if there is one.\n\n\nReactor Parameters\nReactor dimensions (typically volume or diameter and length), shell/jacket volume, heat transfer area, heat transfer coefficient, packed bed porosity, and some measure of reaction time.\n\n\nFluid Properties\nHeat capacity of the reacting fluid or heat capacities of each reagent present in the system, heat capacity of the exchange fluid, reacting fluid density, exchange fluid density, reacting fluid viscosity.\n\n\nReaction Properties\nKinetics parameters for rate expressions, heat of reaction data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Equations for Modeling a Reactor\nThe groups of variables that are needed to describe an ideal reactor were identified above. The purpose of an ideal reactor model is to relate the reactor outputs to the reactor inputs. Mole balances relate the input molar amounts to the output molar amounts, so they are always included in a reactor model. A mole balance can be written for each reagent in the system, whether or not it is present in the reactor input. That includes reagents that are reactants or products in the reactions that are occurring as well as reagents that are neither reactants nor products in any of the reactions. The reagents that do not participate in any of the reactions can be referred to as “inerts.”\nEnergy balances on the reacting fluid and on the exchange fluid relate their output temperatures to the input variables. An energy balance on the reacting fluid also relates the rate at which the reactor performs work to the input variables. The reacting fluid and exchange fluid energy balances also are normally included in the reactor model equations. As discussed below, there are circumstances where a reactor can be modeled without using one or both of the energy balances.\nA momentum balance must sometimes be included in a reactor model for a PFR. When it is included, the momentum balance relates the outlet pressure of the reacting fluid to the reactor inputs. Momentum balances are not needed with any of the stirred tank reactors. The momentum balance accounts for the conversion of kinetic energy associated with the flow of the reacting fluid to thermal energy. While this energy is negligible with respect to the energy balance, it can have a significant effect upon the pressure of the reacting fluid as it flows through a PFR. For the stirred tank reactors, and for a PFR where the momentum balance is not needed, the outlet pressure can be calculated from the other output variables using the equation of state (i. e. using the ideal gas law or assuming liquids to have constant density).\nCollectively, the mole balances, energy balances, and momentum balance (when needed) are commonly referred to as the design equations for the reactor. The words “transient” and “steady state” are used to differentiate two modes of reactor operation. When a reactor operates at steady state, one can watch any one point in the reactor and the conditions (temperature, pressure, composition, flow rate, etc.) will not change over time. At a different point in the reactor, the conditions may be different, but they, too, will be constant over time. Putting it another way, when a reactor operates at steady state, the conditions may vary spatially, but they won’t vary temporally (i. e. over time). In a transient reactor one will observe changes in the conditions over time when watching any one point within the reactor. That is, within a transient reactor the conditions will vary temporally (and possibly spatially, too). Note that BSTRs and SBSTR are always transient while CSTR and PFR operating modes can be either steady state or transient. The most general form of the design equations are those for transient operation. As described in subsequent sections, the design equations for steady-state operation represent a simplification of the transient design equations.\nIn addition to the reactor design equations rate expressions for every reaction taking place it the system are always needed when modeling a reactor. Assuming Arrhenius temperature dependence, the associated pre-exponential factors and activation energies, along with any other parameters appearing in the rate epxressions are included among the reaction properties in Table 6.1. As noted above, physico-chemical properties that appear in the design equations may be functions of temperature, pressure, and/or composition. If so, equations for calculating them are needed, and any parameters appearing in them is included among the fluid properties in Table 6.1.\nTable 6.2 summarizes the equations used to model a generic ideal reactor.\n\n\nTable 6.2: Modeling Equations for a Generic Ideal Reactor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquations\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on reagents present in the system, energy balance on the reacting fluid, energy balance on the exchange fluid, momentum balance (PFRs), and a differential form of the ideal gas law, as needed.\n\n\nRate Expressions\nEquations for calculating the rate of each reaction taking place within the system.\n\n\nOther Equations\nEquations for calculating heat capacities, heats of reaction, density, viscosity, etc., as needed."

    "section": "6.2 Determining Which of the Reactor Design Equations are Needed",
    "text": "6.2 Determining Which of the Reactor Design Equations are Needed\nIt is not always necessary to use all of the reactor modeling equations listed in Table 6.2. For example, mole balances do not need to be written for every reagent in the system because the amounts of the reactants and products in the reactions are related through stoichiometry. The amount of an inert reagent is not related to the amount of any other reagent through stoichiometry. If \\(N_{ind}\\) is the number of mathematically independent reactions taking place in the system, then \\(N_{ind}\\) mole balances are needed to relate the input amounts of reactants and products to the output amounts. Consequently, the minimum number of mole balances is equal to \\(N_{ind}\\) plus one mole balance for each inert reagent. Example 6.9.1 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations using the minimum number of mole balances.\nLiquid-phase systems often consist of a solvent that contains the reagents as solutes. In systems of this type, sensible heat terms are usually written in terms of the mass-specific or volume-specific heat capacity of the entire reacting fluid. Generally, a mole balance on the liquid-phase solvent is not needed for such systems. If, for some reason, the sensible heat terms are written in terms of molar heat capacities of the individual reagents, then the solvent must be included among those reagents and a mole balance on the solvent would need to be included among the reactor design equations. Example 6.9.4 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for a system involving a liquid-phase solution.\nA momentum balance is only needed when the reactor is a PFR. Even then, some PFR problems indicate that pressure drop is negligible, in which case the momentum balance is not needed.\nIf a reactor operates adiabatically there will not be an exchange fluid, and consequently an energy balance on the exchange fluid cannot be included among the design equations. Example 6.9.2 illustrates the formulation of a reactor model for an adiabatic reactor. For historical reasons it is worth noting that for adiabatic systems, the energy balance on the reacting fluid can be replaced by an equation for the adiabatic temperature (see Appendix C and particularly Equation C.4). Before computers became commonplace, doing this sometimes made it easier to solve the design equations analytically. It isn’t as important now that powerful personal computers that can solve multiple ODEs are ubiquitous.\nIf a reactor operates isothermally, the mole balance equations and the energy balance equations are not coupled. The mole balance equations can be solved separately from the two energy balance equations. True isothermal operation of an industrial reactor is not very common, but laboratory reactors that are used to generate kinetics data normally operate isothermally. The energy balances may needed when modeling isothermal reactors, but if the reacting fluid temperature is known, the mole balances can be solved separately from the energy balances, and vice versa. Example 6.9.1 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for an isothermal reactor.\nIf the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid is known and constant, the other reactor design equations can be solved independently from the energy balance on the exchange fluid. There are two situations where this can happen. The first is when the exchange fluid exchange undergoes a phase change and exchanges the associated latent heat. Phase changes occur at constant temperature, so, for example, if condensation of saturated steam at 1 atm is being used to supply heat to the reacting fluid, the temperature of the exchange fluid will be constant and equal to 100 °C. Knowing this, all the other reactor design equations can be solved separately from the energy balance on the exchange fluid. (Note that this is only true because Reaction Engineering Basics always assumes that the exchange fluid undergoes either a phase change or a temperature change, but not both.) In this case, the energy balance on the exchange fluid can be solved separately, for example, to calculate the minimum exchange fluid flow rate needed to provide the required amount of energy to the reacting fluid. Example 6.9.4 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for a system where the exchange fluid phase changes.\nThe other situation where all the other reactor design equations can be solved separately from the energy balance on the exchange fluid occurs in problems for reaction engineering courses. It is not uncommon for a problem to provide only the temperature of the exchange fluid, but not its flow rate or its inlet temperature. In this case the other design equations can be solved independently from the energy balance on the exchange fluid, while the energy balance on the exchange fluid cannot be used because the problem does not provide sufficient information to use it."

    "section": "6.3 Exchange Fluid Energy Balance",
    "text": "6.3 Exchange Fluid Energy Balance\nAn energy balance on the exchange fluid is one of the design equations for every one of the non-adiabatic ideal reactors, so it is considered first here. Reaction Engineering Basics assumes that the exchange fluid continually flows through the shell/jacket, and that within the shell/jacket, it is perfectly mixed. The exchange fluid is further assumed to be a pure fluid that either undergoes phase change or temperature change, but not both. The associated latent or sensible heat is transferred to or from the reacting fluid through a common wall that separates them.\nAs discussed in Appendix D, there are two forms of the energy balance on the exchange fluid: one is used when the temperature of exchange fluid changes, and the other is used when the exchange fluid changes phase. Examples 6.9.3 and 6.9.5 illustrate writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations where the exchange fluid temperature changes and Example 6.9.4 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations where the exchange fluid undergoes a phase change.\n\n6.3.1 Exchange of Sensible Heat\nWhen the exchange fluid undergoes only temperature change, the energy balance on the exchange fluid is given by Equation D.1, which is reproduced here as Equation 6.2. The term on the left side of the equation represents the accumulation of sensible heat within the reactor shell/jacket. The first term on the right side of the equation represents the rate at which heat is transferred from the exchange fluid to the reacting fluid. The last term represents the change in the sensible heat of the exchange fluid as it first enters the shell/jacket and is immediately heated or cooled to the temperature of the exchange fluid within the shell/jacket. The immediate temperature change is a result of perfect mixing within the shell/jacket.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nIn Equation 6.2 the sensible heat terms are written in terms of the mass-specific heat capacity of the exchange fluid, \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\). It has units of energy per mass of exchange fluid per degree of temperature change. The sensible heat terms could also be written in terms of either the volume specific heat capacity (energy per volume of exchange fluid per degree of temperature change) or the molar heat capacity (energy per mole of exchange fluid per degree of temperature change). Equation 6.3 shows the three equivalent ways of writing the accumulation term and Equation 6.4 shows the three equivalent ways of writing the term for the sensible heat change.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V_{ex} \\breve C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\hat C_{p,ex}}{M_{ex}}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\n\\[\n\\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\dot m_{ex}}{\\rho_{ex}} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\breve C_{p,ex}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\dot m_{ex}}{M_{ex}} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\hat C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nIf the reactor operates at steady-state, the time derivative is equal to zero and the energy balance on the exchange fluid reduces to the form shown in Equation 6.5. As above, the term in Equation 6.5 representing the sensible heat change can be written using any of the equivalent forms shown in Equation 6.4.\n\\[\n0 = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\n\n\n6.3.2 Exchange of Latent Heat\nWhen the exchange fluid undergoes only phase change, the energy balance on the exchange fluid is given by Equation D.2, which is reproduced here as Equation 6.6. The term on the left side of the equation represents the accumulation of latent heat within the reactor shell/jacket, the first term on the right side of the equation represents the rate at which heat is transferred from the exchange fluid to the reacting fluid, and the last term represents the change in the latent heat of the fraction of the exchange fluid that condenses or evaporates.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\tag{6.6}\\]\nIf the reactor operates at steady-state, the time derivative is equal to zero and the energy balance on the exchange fluid reduces to Equation 6.7.\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot Q - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\tag{6.7}\\]"

    "section": "6.4 Ideal BSTR Design Equations",
    "text": "6.4 Ideal BSTR Design Equations\nFrom the perspective of the reacting fluid, a BSTR is a closed system. Reacting fluid neither enters nor leaves the reactor while it is operating. This is apparent in the schematic BSTR diagram, Figure 6.1. The reacting fluid is shown in blue in that figure, with no reacting fluid entering or leaving. If the reactor has a one, the shell/jacket is an open system; heat exchange fluid continually flows through it. Figure 6.1 depicts a BSTR with a shell/jacket; the exchange fluid within it is shown in yellow. The two agitators in the figure are reminders that the reacting fluid within the reaction compartment and the exchange fluid within the shell are each perfectly mixed. An adiabatic BSTR would not have a shell/jacket.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Schematic Representation of a Batch Stirred Tank Reactor\n\n\nThe most important assumptions when modeling an ideal BSTR are (i) the reaction zone is a closed system, (ii) within the reactor, the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iii) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, (iv) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture and (v) the reacting fluid does not undergo a phase change while the reactor is operating. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix G. Examples 6.9.1 and 6.9.2 illustrate writing, simplifying and solving reactor design equations for BSTRs.\nThe mole balance on any one reagent, \\(i\\), in an ideal BSTR is presented in Equation 6.8. It has only two terms: the term on the left side of the equation represents the rate of accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) and the term on the right side represents its net rate of generation. The summation in the generation term includes all reactions occurring in the system.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.8}\\]\nThe energy balance on the reacting fluid within an ideal BSTR is presented in Equation 6.9. The summation on the left side of the equation includes all reagents present in the system, not just reactants and products of the reactions. Similarly, the summation of the right side of the equation includes all reactions taking place in the system.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\frac{dV}{dt}  = \\dot Q - \\dot W - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\tag{6.9}\\]\nThe first term on the left side of Equation 6.9 represents the rate of accumulation of energy in the form of sensible heat. It is written in terms of the molar heat capacities of all of the reagents present in the system. That is probably the most common form of this term for a gas-phase reacting fluid. For liquid-phase reacting fluids, the sensible heat accumulation term is often expressed in terms of the mass-specific heat capacity of the fluid as a whole or the volume-specific heat capacity of the entire fluid. Equation 6.10 shows the three equivalent ways of writing the sensible heat accumulation term.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\tag{6.10}\\]\nThe second and third terms on the left side of Equation 6.9 represent accumulation of energy associated with expansion or contraction of the reacting fluid. On the right side of the equation, \\(\\dot Q\\) represents the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid. This term is the rate at which heat passes from the yellow exchange fluid in Figure 6.1 through the red internal wall and into the blue reacting fluid. If the exchange fluid is being used to heat the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot Q\\) is positive; if the exchange fluid is being used to cool the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot Q\\) is negative.\nIn Equation 6.9, \\(\\dot W\\) represents the rate at which the reacting fluid is doing mechanical work on the surroundings. In most cases, the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is work of the agitator as it mixes the reacting fluid. In this case, \\(\\dot W\\) is the agitator power delivered to the reacting fluid, and since it is added to the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot W\\) is negative. If the reacting fluid is able to expand and cause movement of a reactor wall, for example if it caused a piston to move, \\(\\dot W\\) would be positive and equal to the work needed to move the piston.\nThe final term in Equation 6.9 represents the energy associated with the reactions taking place within the reactor, i. e. the heats of reaction. As previously noted, the summation in this term includes all reactions taking place in the system.\nThe design equations for a BSTR are initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). In order to solve them, the number of dependent variables must equal the number of IVODEs. The differential form of the ideal gas law presented in Equation 6.11 is used when the number of dependent variables exceeds the number of IVODEs.\n\\[\nP \\frac{dV}{dt} + V \\frac{dP}{dt} - R \\left( T \\sum_i \\frac{dn_i}{dt} + \\left( \\sum_i n_i \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} \\right) = 0\n\\tag{6.11}\\]\n\n6.4.1 Common Simplifications of the BSTR Design Equations\nTypically, the walls of a BSTR are rigid. For gas-phase reacting fluids, when the reactor walls are rigid, the gas will always occupy the entire reactor volume and that volume will be constant. For liquid-phase reacting fluids, the reactor volume may not be completely full. If there is space above the top surface of the liquid, it is called headspace. In this situation, the volume appearing in the mole and energy balances is the volume of the liquid; it does not include the headspace. However, in Reaction Engineering Basics liquids are always assumed to be incompressible, ideal mixtures. Consequently, the volume is always constant for a liquid-phase reacting fluid, too. Thus, when the walls are rigid, the volume is constant for both gas-phase and liquid phase reacting fluids. In this case, the time derivative of the volume in the energy balance and in the differential form of the ideal gas law is equal to zero, Equation 6.12.\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0\n\\tag{6.12}\\]\nIn all of the stirred tank models, the pressure change due to hydrostatic head is assumed to be negligible. That is, at all depths below the liquid surface the pressure is assumed to be the same. Because liquid-phase reacting fluids are assumed to be incompressible ideal mixtures, the pressure will be constant as the temperature and composition change. Since the pressure is constant, its time derivative will equal zero, equation Equation 6.13.\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\n\\tag{6.13}\\]\nAs already noted, it is often true that the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator. When compared to the magnitude of all of the other terms in the energy balance, this term is virtually always negligible, Equation 6.14. As an example, consider stirring a room temperature glass of water as vigourously as one is able to try to raise its temperature. One could stir as hard as possible and the temperature change would be very, very small.\n\\[\n\\dot W = 0\n\\tag{6.14}\\]\nIt has already been noted that if the reactor operates adiabatically, there will not be an exchange fluid in the reactor. By definition, the rate of heat input is equal to zero for an adiabatic process, Equation 6.15.\n\\[\n\\dot Q = 0\n\\tag{6.15}\\]\n\n\n6.4.2 Ancillary Equations\nAs previously noted, the design equations for a BSTR are initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). In order to solve a set of IVODEs, every quantity appearing in the IVODEs must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. The independent variable in the BSTR balance equations is time. Depending upon the specific reactor system, the dependent variables may include the molar amounts of the reagents, the temperature of the reacting fluid, the pressure of the reacting fluid, and the exchange fluid temperature.\nWhen rate expressions are substituted into the mole and energy balances, they will introduce concentrations or partial pressures (for gases), of some reagents. Those concentrations or partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the dependent variables in the IVODEs. This is accomplished using the defining equations for concentration and partial pressure, Equation 6.16 and Equation 6.17.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{n_i}{V}\n\\tag{6.16}\\]\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{n_iRT}{V}\n\\tag{6.17}\\]\nThe rate of heat transfer to the reacting fluid from the exchange fluid can be expressed in terms of the temperatures of those fluids using the overall heat transfer coefficient as shown in Equation 6.18.\n\\[\n\\dot Q = UA\\left( T_{ex} - T \\right)\n\\tag{6.18}\\]\nNote also that variable quantities appearing in any ancillary equation must also be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables."

    "section": "6.5 Ideal SBSTR Design Equations",
    "text": "6.5 Ideal SBSTR Design Equations\nThe only difference between an ideal BSTR and an ideal SBSTR is that fluid flows into or out of an ideal SBSTR. A very common situation where fluid flows in, is one where the reaction is higly exothermic, such as when neutralizing a strong acid using a strong base. If a BSTR was used, i. e. if all of the reactants were added at once, it would not be possible to control the temperature due to the very high initial rate of reaction and concommitant release of heat. By using an SBSTR where one of the reactants flows into the reactor, the temperature can be controlled by controlling the rate at which that reactant is added. This mode of SBSTR operation is sometimes called batch-fed or fed-batch operation. It is illustrated schematically in Figure 6.2. This is the only SBSTR operational mode that is considered in Reaction Engineering Basics. The other mode is one where no fluid enters the reactor, but fluid flows out. Most commonly this is done by operating at the boiling point of the reacting liquid, resulting in a two-phase system where the vaporized reagents flow out of the reactor. The presence of two phases in the reactor introduces additional complications that are typically considered in more advanced reaction engineering textbooks.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Schematic Representation of a Semi-Batch Stirred Tank Reactor\n\n\nThe most important assumptions when modeling an ideal SBSTR are (i) fluid flows into the reactor, but not out, (ii) the fluid does not change phase upon entering the reactor or within it (iii) within the reactor the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iv) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, and (v) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix G. Example 6.9.3 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving the reactor design equations for an ideal SBSTR.\nNot surprisingly, the mole and energy balances for an SBSTR are similar to those for a BSTR, but with additional terms associated with the fluid stream flowing into the reactor. The ideal SBSTR mole balance is shown in Equation 6.19. The first and last terms are the same as in the BSTR mole balance. The added term represents the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) into the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.19}\\]\nSimilarly, the ideal SBSTR energy balance, shown in Equation 6.20, has one additional term that is not found in the BSTR energy balance. The added term is the third term on the right side of Equation 6.20. It represents the heat required to raise or lower the entering fluid from its feed temperature to the temperature of the reacting fluid. Due to the assumption of perfect mixing, this temperature change occurs instantaneously as the fluid enters the reactor.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_i \\left( n_i \\hat C_{p,i}\\right) & \\frac{dT}{dt} -V\\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\ &- \\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT  - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{6.20}\\]\nAs in the BSTR energy balance, the two sensible heat terms in Equation 6.20 are written in terms of the molar heat capacities of the reagents in the system. This form is common for gas-phase systems, but for liquid-phase systems it is sometimes useful to express these sensible heats in terms of the mass-specific heat capacity of the reacting fluid or the volume-specific heat capacity of the fluid. Equation 6.10 shows the equivalent ways of writing the heat accumulation term. Equation 6.21 shows equivalent ways of writing the term for the sensible heat added to the feed fluid.\n\\[\n\\sum_i \\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\tilde C_pdT\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\breve C_pdT\n\\tag{6.21}\\]\nThe differential form of the ideal gas law for an SBSTR is the same as that for a BSTR, Equation 6.11.\n\n6.5.1 Common Simplifications of the SBSTR Design Equations\nIt is important to understand that for each of the ideal reactor types, the mole and energy balances are written for the reacting fluid volume, not the physical volume of the reactor. Gas-phase reacting fluids expand to fill the physical volume of the reactor, so assuming the reactor walls are rigid, the reacting fluid volume will be constant and the time derivative of the reacting fluid volume will equal zero, Equation 6.12. However, for a liquid, the volume of the reacting fluid will increase as the feed enters the reactor. In other words, as liquid enters the SBSTR, the reacting fluid volume will increase and the headspace will decrease. If the reacting liquid is assumed to be an incompressible ideal mixture, and the feed flows in at a constant rate, the reacting fluid volume will then be given by Equation 6.22. The time derivative of the reacting fluid volume shown in equation Equation 6.23 applies even if the inlet feed rate is variable as long as the liquid is an incompressible ideal mixture.\n\\[\nV = V_0 + \\dot V_{in}t\n\\tag{6.22}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot V_{in}\n\\tag{6.23}\\]\nMany of the simplifications used for BSTRs are also used for SBSTRs. If the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator, the rate of doing work, \\(\\dot W\\), may be assumed to be negligible, Equation 6.14. If the reactor operates adiabatically, the heat input term, \\(\\dot Q\\), is equal to zero, Equation 6.15. Assuming the liquid to be an incompressible ideal mixture, the time derivative of the pressure, for liquids, is equal to zero, Equation 6.13.\n\n\n6.5.2 Ancillary Equations\nThe ancillary equations commonly used with batch reactors are also used with semi-batch reactors. Specifically, the defining equations for concentration and partial pressure, Equations 6.16 and 6.17, can be used to express those quantities in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. Similarly, the rate of heat transfer can be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables using Equation 6.18."

    "section": "6.6 Ideal CSTR Design Equations",
    "text": "6.6 Ideal CSTR Design Equations\nAn ideal CSTR is similar to an ideal BSTR and an ideal SBSTR, with the primary difference being that fluid continuously flows in and out of a CSTR. This is represented schematically in Figure 6.3. Notice that because the reacting fluid within the reactor is perfectly mixed, the outlet temperature equals the temperature of the reacting fluid within the reactor. Similarly, the figure shows that the concentrations of the reagents leaving the reactor are the same as they are within the reactor. When writing the ideal CSTR mole and energy balance equations, the “out” is omitted from the subscript to simplify the notation. (The “in” is retained for the feed stream, however, to differentiate it from the outlet stream.)\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Schematic Representation of a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor\n\n\nThe most important assumptions of the ideal CSTR model are (i) the reactor is an open system with fluid continually flowing in and out, (ii) within the reactor the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed, (iii) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, (iv) no phase changes occur upon entering or within the reactor, and (v) the reacting fluid is an ideal mixture. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix G. Example 6.9.4 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving the reactor design equations for an ideal CSTR.\nA mole balance on reagent \\(i\\) in a CSTR is presented in Equation 6.24. In contrast to the BSTR and SBSTR balances, the CSTR mole and energy balances are written in terms of the molar flow rates of the reagents, \\(\\dot n_i\\), not the molar amounts, \\(n_i\\). The three terms on the left side of Equation 6.24 represent the accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) in the reacting fluid. The first term is accumulation due to a changing outlet molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\). The second term represents accumulation due to the volume of the reacting fluid changing and the third represents accumulation due to changes in the outlet volumetric flow rate. The first term on the right side of the equation is clearly the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) into the reactor and the second term on the right side is its molar flow out of the reactor. The last term represents the moles of reagent \\(i\\) that are generated by the reactions taking place within the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} + \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\\frac{dV}{dt} - \\frac{\\dot n_iV}{\\dot V^2}\\frac{d \\dot V}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.24}\\]\nThe energy balance on the reacting fluid within an ideal CSTR is presented in Equation 6.25. The terms in that equation have a one-to-one correspondence with the terms in the SBSTR energy balance, Equation 6.20, representing sensible heat accumulation, two components of the accumulation of energy associated with mechanical work done by the reacting fluid, the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid, the rate at which the reacting fluid does work on the surroundings, the heat required to raise or lower the entering fluid from its feed temperature to the temperature of the reacting fluid, and the energy associated with the reactions taking place within the reactor, respectively. The first term looks different because the ideal CSTR balances are written in terms of molar flow rates and not molar amounts.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) &\\frac{dT}{dt} - V \\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\&- \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.25}\\]\nOnce again, the sensible heat terms in Equation 6.25 are written in terms of the molar heat capacities of the reagents in the system. Equation 6.26 shows equivalent ways of writing the first term in Equation 6.25, and Equation 6.21 shows equivalent ways of writing the next to last term in Equation 6.25.\n\\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\sum_i \\left( \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i}  \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\tag{6.26}\\]\nAs discussed below, both the volume and the pressure are constant in a gas-phase CSTR. For that reason, a differential form of the ideal gas law is not needed for CSTRs.\n\n6.6.1 Common Simplifications of the CSTR Design Equations\nWhen the CSTR walls are rigid a gas-phase reacting fluid will always occupy the complete physical volume of the reactor. That means that the volume in the mole and energy balances will be constant and the time-derivative of the volume will equal zero, Equation 6.12. Very often this is also true for a liquid-phase reacting fluid. However it is possible for the reacting fluid volume to increase or decrease, along with an equal but opposite change in the headspace. When the liquid is assumed to be an incompressibe, ideal mixture, this only happens if the inlet and outlet volumetric flow rates are not equal.\nIdeal CSTRs are almost always assumed to operate at constant pressure. As a consequence, the time derivative of the pressure is then equal to zero, Equation 6.13. Unlike BSTRs and SBSTRs where this was only true for liquid-phase reacting fluids, for CSTRs this is true for both liquid-phase and gas-phase reacting fluids.\nAs was true for the other stirred tank reactors, when the only mechanical work associated with the reacting fluid is that of the agitator, the rate of work being done by the fluid may be assumed to be negligible, Equation 6.14. As for all reactors, if the reactor operates adiabatically, the rate of heat input is zero, Equation 6.15.\nFinally, continuous reactors like CSTRs can operate at steady state. In fact CSTRs are usually designed to operate at steady state. When a CSTR operates at steady state, all of the time derivatives are equal to zero. Steady-state operation is considered separately, below.\n\n\n6.6.2 Ancillary Equations\nWhen rate expressions are substituted into the CSTR design equations, they introduce concentrations or partial pressures. Before the design equations can be solved, the concentrations or partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the independent and dependent variables. This can be done using their defining equations for open systems, Equations 6.27 and 6.28. In these equations the molar flow rates and volumetric flow rates are the outlet values. The rate needs to be evaluated at the conditions within the reactor, but because a CSTR is perfectly mixed, the outlet concentration, partial pressure, and temperature are equal to the concentration, partial pressure, and temperature within the reactor.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\tag{6.27}\\]\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{ \\dot n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i \\dot n_i}P\n\\tag{6.28}\\]\nIt important to remember that the volumetric flow rate for gas phase systems can change. The ideal gas law, Equation 6.29, can be used to express the volumetric flow rate in terms of the dependent variables. The rate of heat transfer can be expressed in terms of a heat transfer coefficient as was done for the other stirred tank reactors, Equation 6.18. Equations also are needed for heat capacities, heats of reaction, kinetics parameters, etc. if they are not constant.\n\\[\n\\dot V = \\frac{\\displaystyle RT \\sum_i \\dot n_i}{P}\n\\tag{6.29}\\]\n\n\n6.6.3 Steady-State CSTR Design Equations\nIt was noted above that CSTRs are typically designed to operate at steady state, and when they do, all of the time derivatives in the balance equations are equal to zero. The resulting steady-state CSTR mole and energy balances are presented in Equation 6.30 and Equation 6.31.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.30}\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot Q - \\dot W - \\sum_i\\dot n_{i,in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\tag{6.31}\\]\nWhen applicable, the common simplifications and ancillary equations identified above for transient CSTRs can also be used with steady-state CSTRs."

    "section": "6.7 Ideal PFR Design Equations",
    "text": "6.7 Ideal PFR Design Equations\nThe ideal PFR is very different from the three ideal stirred tank reactor types. It is not perfectly mixed, but instead the reacting fluid flows steadily from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet. The reactor is assumed to be cylindrical with a constant diameter, and the reacting fluid is assumed to flow only in the axial direction. The velocity of the flow at any fixed axial position is constant across the full diameter of the tubular reactor. This is called plug flow, and is illustrated in Figure 6.4. If the walls of the reactor were transparent and it was possible to color a disk-shaped portion of the fluid as shown in that figure, the colored fluid would look like a solid disk moving from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: In plug flow, the aqua-colored fluid would appear to move from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor, retaining its disk shape the entire time.\n\n\nIn addition, the PFR model assumes that at any one axial position, the reacting fluid is perfectly mixed in the radial direction. As a consequence, there are no composition, temperature or pressure gradients in the radial direction. The composition, temperature, and pressure will change as a function of axial position. This is indicated by a gradient in the blue color representing the reacting fluid in the schematic representation, Figure 6.5. As that figure also shows, heat can be exchanged through the entire cylindrical wall of the reactor since the shell/jacket surrounds it.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Schematic Representation of a Plug Flow Reactor\n\n\nThe most important assumptions of the ideal PFR model are (i) the reactor is cylindrical with a constant diameter, (ii) the reacting fluid is in plug flow, (iii) there is perfect mixing of the reacting flow in the radial direction and no mixing in the axial direction, (iv) the reaction rates are normalized per unit volume of reacting fluid, and (v) no phase changes occur upon entering or within the reactor. A complete listing of the assumptions and a detailed derivation of the mole and energy balances on the reacting fluid are presented in Appendix G. Example 6.9.5 illustrates writing, simplifying and solving the reactor design equations for an ideal PFR.\nA mole balance on any one reagent, \\(i\\) in an ideal PFR is presented in Equation 6.32. The first term on the left side of the reactor represents the change in the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) along the length of the reactor. The second term represents the accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) at any point in the reactor due to change in its molar flow rate while the third term represents the accumulation of reagent \\(i\\) at any point due to change in the volumetric flow rate of the reacting fluid. The term on the right side of Equation 6.32 represents the generation of reagent \\(i\\) due to the reactions that are taking place within the reactor.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot n_i}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\frac{\\partial\\dot n_i}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\pi D^2\\dot n_i}{4\\dot V^2} \\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial t}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.32}\\]\nThe energy balance on the reacting fluid in an ideal PFR takes the form shown in Equation 6.33. The first term on the left side of the equation represents the change in sensible heat along the length of the reactor while the second term represents the accumulation of sensible heat at any one point in the reactor. The third term on the left side of Equation 6.33 represents the accumulation of energy corresponding to the work associated with flow at any point in the reactor. The first term on the right side of the equation represents the rate of heat transfer from the exchange fluid to the reacting fluid at any axial position in the reactor. The last term represents the heat associated with the occurrence of the reactions.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\left(\\sum_i \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} +& \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\sum_i \\left(\\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t} \\\\ &= \\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right) - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.33}\\]\nThe sensible heat terms in Equation 6.33 are expressed in terms of the molar heat capacities of the reagents. Equation 6.34 shows equivalent ways of expressing the term representing the change in sensible heat along the length of the reactor using the mass-specific heat capacity or the volume-specific heat capacity of the reacting fluid. Equation 6.35 does the same for the term representing the accumulation of sensible heat.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho \\dot V \\tilde C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\dot V \\breve C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\n\\tag{6.34}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\sum_i \\left(\\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\rho \\tilde C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} \\breve C_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}\n\\tag{6.35}\\]\nAnother difference between the ideal PFR and the ideal CSTR is the possibility of a drop in the pressure of the reacting fluid as it flows through the reactor. It was noted previously that pressure drop in a CSTR is usually assumed to be negligible. While that may be true for an ideal PFR, the friction between the fluid and the reactor walls and between the fluid and the particles making up a packed bed within the reactor can cause some of the kinetic energy associated with the flow to degrade into heat. The effect upon the energy balance is typically negligible, but this degradation of mechanical energy to heat also results in pressure drop. A momentum balance (also called a mechanical energy balance) is used to calculate the pressure drop. The momentum balance equation for an ideal PFR is shown in Equation 6.36.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{4 \\dot V}{\\pi D^2} \\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4 \\rho} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} = - \\frac{2 f \\dot V^2}{\\pi D^3}\n\\tag{6.36}\\]\nThe differential form of the ideal gas law for a PFR is expressed in terms of flow variables, Equation 6.37.\n\\[\nP \\frac{d \\dot{V}}{dt} + \\dot{V} \\frac{dP}{dt} - R \\left( T \\sum_i \\frac{d\\dot{n}_i}{dt} + \\left( \\sum_i \\dot{n}_i \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} \\right) = 0\n\\tag{6.37}\\]\n\n6.7.1 Common Simplifications of the PFR Design Equations\nIf an ideal PFR operates adiabatically, the heat transfer term is equal to zero as shown in Equation 6.38.\n\\[\n\\pi D U\\left( T_{ex} - T  \\right) = 0\n\\tag{6.38}\\]\nFor liquid phase systems that are assumed to be incompressible ideal mixtures the derivative of the volumetric flow rate with respect to axial position is equal to zero, Equation 6.39.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial z} = 0\n\\tag{6.39}\\]\nLike CSTRs, PFRs typically are designed to operate at steady state. In the mole, energy, and momentum balance equations for an ideal steady-state PFR, all of the time derivatives are equal to zero. Steady-state operation is considered separately below.\n\n\n6.7.2 Ancillary Equations\nThe most common ancillary equations used when modeling an ideal PFR are the same as those used with CSTRs. Concentrations and partial pressures introduced in rate expressions can be written in terms of the dependent variables in the balance equations using Equations 6.27 and 6.28. As with the CSTR, it is important to remember that the volumetric flow rate of a gas-phase reacting system can change. Equation 6.29 is again used to express the volumetric flow rate of a gas-phase system in terms of the molar flow rates, temperature, and pressure. Ancillary equations for heat capacities, heats of reaction, kinetics parameters, etc. are also needed if these quantities cannot be assumed to be constant.\n\n\n6.7.3 Steady-State PFR Design Equations\nThe mole and energy balance equations for modeling an ideal, steady-state PFR are generated by setting all of the time derivatives in Equations 6.32 and 6.33 equal to zero. The resulting steady-state PFR mole balance is shown in Equation 6.40, and the resulting energy balance is shown in Equation 6.41. Notice that because none of the variables depend upon time when operating at steady state, the partial derivatives with respect to \\(z\\) become ordinary derivatives.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\tag{6.40}\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i \\dot n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{d T}{d z} = \\pi D U\\left( T_e - T  \\right) - \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\tag{6.41}\\]\nIn some situations the pressure drop in an ideal PFR can be negligible. In that case, a momentum balance is not used when modeling the reactor. If the pressure drop is not negligible, or if it isn’t known whether the pressure drop is significant, a momentum balance is used. The steady-state, ideal PFR momentum balance can take one of two forms. If the reacting fluid is the only thing in the reactor, the steady-state momentum balance shown in Equation 6.42 is used. If the reactor contains solid particles in the form of a packed bed, the steady-state momentum balance shown in Equation 6.43 is used instead. The latter equation is called the Ergun equation, named after Sabri Ergun who first derived it (Ergun 1952).\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = - \\frac{4G}{\\pi D^2} \\frac{d \\dot V}{dz} - \\frac{fG^2}{2D \\rho}\n\\tag{6.42}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{dP}}{{dz}} =  - \\frac{{1 - \\varepsilon }}{{{\\varepsilon ^3}}}\\frac{{{G^2}}}{{\\rho {\\Phi _s}{D_p}}}\\left[ {\\frac{{150\\left( {1 - \\varepsilon } \\right)\\mu }}{{{\\Phi _s}{D_p}G}} + 1.75} \\right]\n\\tag{6.43}\\]"

    "section": "6.8 Numerical Solution of the Reactor Design Equations",
    "text": "6.8 Numerical Solution of the Reactor Design Equations\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics, the transient PFR reactor design equations are not used in any analyses. Consequently, in all but two cases, the reactor design equations are a set of coupled, initial-value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). The numerical solution of sets of IVODEs is discussed in Appendix I. For present purposes, the following points are important.\n\nThe number of IVODEs must equal the number of dependent variables appearing in them.\nTo solve a set of IVODEs numerically, equations must be written to calculate every quantity appearing in them from known constants, the independent variable, and the dependent variables.\nThe solution of IVODEs begins at a value of the independent variable where the value of every dependent variable is known. These “initial values” must be specified when solving the IVODEs.\nIVODEs are solved by increasing the independent variable in small increments and calculating the values of the dependent variables each time the independent variable is incremented. When solving IVODEs, a “stopping” criterion must be specified to indicate when to stop incrementing the independent variable. The stopping criterion is a value for one of the dependent variables or for the independent variable. When that value is reached the solution is complete and the solver stops incrementing the independent variable.\nThe numerical solution of a set of IVODEs is a set of values of the independent variables and each of the dependent variables spanning the range from the initial values to the point where the stopping criterion was satisifed.\n\nOne of the two cases where the reactor design equations are not a set of IVODEs occurs when a steady-state PFR is heated or cooled using sensible heat of the exchange fluid and the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid is not known. In this case the design equations are a set of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), specifically a set IVODEs coupled to one algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE). The numerical solution of DAEs is discussed in Appendix L. In this case, the important points with respect to numerical solution of the reactor design equations are almost the same. The differences are (i) that in addition to solving the IVODEs as above, the one additional unknown quantity from the ATE is found and (ii) the equations in the second bullet above can use the unknown in the ATE in addition to constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.\nThe other case where the reactor design equations are not a set of IVODEs occurs when the reactor is a steady-state CSTR. In this case, the reactor design equations are a set of ATEs. The numerical solution of sets of ATEs is discussed in Appendix H. The important points with respect to numerical solution of a set of ATEs are as follow.\n\nA set of \\(N\\) ATEs can be solved to find the values of \\(N\\) unknown quantities appearing in them.\nThe \\(N\\) unknowns to be found by solving the ATEs must be specified.\nTo solve the set of ATEs numerically, equations must be written to calculate every quantity appearing in them from known constants and the \\(N\\) unknowns.\n\nReaction Engineering Basics assumes that the reactor design equations will be solved numerically. There are many, many software packages that can be used to do this. Because different readers will uses different software packages, Reaction Engineering Basics does not present computer code that performs the calculations. It does, however, fully formulate the calculations in a manner that the reader can use to write the necessary computer code for their software of choice.\nWhile there are instances where doing so isn’t necessary, in Reaction Engineering Basics the design equations are always solved numerically to find the reactor output variables (see Table 6.1). That is, when formulating the solution of the design equations, it is always assumed that the reactor inputs, reactor parameters, fluid properties, and reaction properties are known. The reasons for this won’t be discussed here, but it can be noted that in all cases except for steady-state CSTRs (where the design equations are ATEs), this is necessary for numerical solution.\nAdditional calculations that use the results from solving the design equations are often required to complete an analysis. In Reaction Engineering Basics, this is accomplished by solving the design equations within a reactor response function as described in Chapter 7. The response function is a computer function or subroutine. Later chapters will show how missing reactor inputs or reactor parameters can be passed to the response function so that the design equations then can be solved for the reactor outputs. Once the design equations have been solved within the response function, any other quantities that depend upon the reactor outputs can be calculated and returned by the response function."

    "text": "6.9 Examples\nThe examples in this chapter illustrate choosing those design equations that are needed to model the reactors described in the example. In doing so, all summations and continuous products are expanded and any terms that are negligible or equal to zero are eliminated. Solving the design equations presented in these examples would require additional ancillary equations. The solution of the design equations and the ancillary equations needed for doing so will be described and discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\n6.9.1 Modeling an Isothermal BSTR using the Minimum Number of Mole Balances\nGas phase reaction (1) occurs isothermally at a known temperature in an ideal BSTR. Initially the reactor contains only known molar amounts of A, B, and an inert gas, I. The reaction ends after a known amount of time. The rate expression for gas-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence.\n\\[\nA + 2 B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\nWrite the minimum number of reactor design equations, and the associated initial values and stopping criterion, needed to model the composition within this system over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis problem doesn’t ask me to calculate anything. It asks me to write the minimum number of design equations for the system. The design equations always include mole balances for each of the inert reagents, so I’ll need a mole balance for reagent I. The minimum number of additional mole balances equals the number of mathematically independent reactions that are taking place. In this case only one reaction is occurring, so I will need one additional mole balance on one of the reactants or products. I’ll write it for reactant A.\nThe problem also states that the reactor operates isothermally and the temperature is known. That means the mole balances can be solved separately from the energy balances. Momentum balances are not used with stirred tanks. Solving the mole balances will yield the molar amounts vs. time, so the minimum set of design equations consists of a mole balance on I and a mole balance on A (or B, or Y, or Z).\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nEquation (3) shows a mole balance on the inert reagent, I, and equation (4) presents a mole balance on reagent A.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_I}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_I = n_{I,0} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -r_1V \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.8. There is only one reaction, \\(j\\), so the sum becomes a single term.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{dn_i}{dt} =  \\nu_{i,1}r_1V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficient of reagent I is zero, leading to a trivial mole balance that can be solved analytically.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_I}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad n_I = \\text{constant} = n_{I,0}\n\\]\nIn the case of reagent A, its stoichiometric coefficient in reaction (1) is -1, which can be substituted into the general mole balance.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \\nu_{A,1}r_1V = -r_1V\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equation that needs to be solved, equation (4), is an IVODE, and as the problem implies, initial values and a stopping criterion are needed in order to solve it. The instant that the reaction begins can be defined as \\(t=0\\) and used as the initial value of the independent variable. To solve equation (4), the corresponding initial value of the dependent variable \\(n_A\\) must be specified. In this problem the initial molar amount of A, \\(n_{A,0}\\), is known.\nA stopping criterion is also needed. Here the problem statement says that the length of time that the reaction proceeded is known. Having defined \\(t=0\\) as the time when the reaction started, the stopping criterion is that the time equals that known length of time, \\(t_f\\).\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\nTable 6.3: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equation, equation (4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_f\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to the widespread availability of computers it was quite common to formulate reactor modeling equations using the minimum number of mole balances. In a problem like this one where the reactor is isothermal, doing so often makes it possible to solve the IVODE design equation analytically.\nIt should also be noted that energy balances were not needed here because the problem specifically stated that the composition of the reactor over time was to be modeled. For an isothermal system where the temperature is known, the mole balances can be solved independently of the energy balances. An alternative assignment might have provided additional information and asked the coolant flow rate as a function of time that would be necessary to operate the reactor isothermally. For that assignment the energy balances would be needed, even though the mole balances still could be solved independently of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.9.2 Modeling an Adiabatic BSTR\nGas-phase reaction (1) takes place in an ideal, adiabatic BSTR. It is irreversible and first-order in A, equation (2). The heat of reaction and the heat capacities of the reagents may be assumed to be constant. Initially the reactor contains only reagent A at a known temperature, \\(T_0\\), and pressure, \\(P_0\\), and the reaction proceeds until the temperature reaches \\(T_f\\).\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow B \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 C_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nWrite and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system, including the associated initial values and stopping criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m asked here to write and simplify the design equations, but not to solve them. In most assignments, the design equations will be solved numerically, and when that is true, I prefer to include a mole balance for every reagent present in the system. Here the only reagents are A and B, so mole balances will be written for each of them. An energy balance on the reacting fluid will also be included in the design equations. Since the reactor is adiabatic, there isn’t an exchange fluid, meaning an energy balance on the exchange fluid will not be included among the design equations. Momentum balances are not used with stirred tanks, so the complete set of design equations will consist of a mole balance on reagent A, a mole balance on reagent B, and an energy balance on the reacting fluid.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on reagents A and B are shown in equations (3) and (4), respectively.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = - r_1 V \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} =  r_1 V \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.8 and expand the summation.

There is only one reaction occurring, so the last summation reduces to a single term. The volume of a BSTR is constant, so the time derivative of the volume is equal to zero. The reactor is adiabatic, so \\(\\dot Q\\) is equal to zero, and the reacting fluid does no work, so \\(\\dot W\\) is equal to zero (assuming the power associated with agitation is negligible).\n\\[\n\\left( n_A \\hat C_{p,A} + n_B \\hat C_{p,B} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} -V r_1 \\Delta H_1\n\\]\nThe pressure in this system is not constant because the temperature will change as the reaction proceeds, and for an ideal gas at constant volume, the pressure will change as the temperature changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations are IVODEs, so initial values and a stopping criterion must be specified.\nThe instant that the reaction begins can be defined as \\(t=0\\) and used as the initial value of the independent variable. The problem states that initially the reactor contains only reagent A, and \\(n_{A,0}\\) can be used to represent its molar amount. The initial molar amount of B then is zero. The problem states that the initial temperature is \\(T_0\\).\nThe problem states that the reaction proceeds until a temperature of \\(T_f\\) is reached, so the stopping criterion for this assignment is that \\(T=T_f\\).\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\nTable 6.4: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3), (4) and (5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\\(T_f\\)\n\n\n\\(P\\)\n\\(P_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volume was assumed to be constant when writing the design equations for this assignment. In chemical processing equipment there are almost never moving reactor walls. As a consequence, when the reacting fluid is an ideal gas or an ideal liquid solution, the reactor volume can always be assumed to be fixed, meaning its time derivative may always be assumed to be zero. In Reaction Engineering Basics, the assignment would explicity say so if this was not true.\nThe three design equations written here cannot be solved as written. There are 3 IVODEs, but they contain 4 dependent variables (\\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(T\\), and \\(P\\)). An additional, ancillary ODE is needed that contains at least one of these dependent variables and that does not introduce additional dependent variables. Typically a differential form of the ideal gas law would be used for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.9.3 Modeling a Cooled SBSTR\nThe exothermic, liquid-phase acid neutralization, reaction (1), occurs in an ideal SBSTR. The heat of reaction and heat capacity of the solution are constant. The rate is second order overall, first order in each reactant, equation (2). Initially a volume, \\(V_0\\), of solution at temperature, \\(T_0\\), is present in the reactor. That solution contains only B at a concentration of \\(C_{B0}\\). To start the process another solution containing only A at a concentration of \\(C_{A,in}\\) and a temperature of \\(T_{in}\\) begins flowing into the reactor. The volumetric flow rate of the added solution increases linearly with time according to equation (3), where \\(\\alpha\\) is a known constant. The pressure, \\(P\\), is constant. The reactor jacket initially contains chilled water at a temperature of \\(T_{ex,0}\\). At the same time that the reactant solution starts flowing into the reactor, chilled water at \\(T_{ex,in}\\) starts to flow into the jacket. The volumetric flow rate of the chilled water is constant during the process and equal to \\(\\dot V_{ex,in}\\). The reactor jacket volume is \\(V_{ex}\\), the heat transfer area is \\(A\\), and the heat transfer coefficient is \\(U\\). The reactant solution flows into the reactor for a period of time, \\(t_f\\), after which the process ends.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow S + W \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot V_{in} = \\alpha t \\tag{3}\n\\]\nWrite and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system, including any necessary initial values and stopping criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations always include mole balances. As noted after this problem, using the minimum number of mole balances is tricky when the reactor is an SBSTR, so I will write a mole balance one each of the reagents, A, B, S, and W. The reactor is neither isothermal nor adiabatic, so energy balances on the reacting fluid and on the exchange fluid must also be included among the design equations. A momentum balance is not included because momentum balances are not used with stirred tank reactors.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on A, B, S, and W take the form shown in equations (4) through (7).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \\dot n_{A,in} - r_1V \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = - r_1V \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_S}{dt} = r_1V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_W}{dt} = r_1V \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.19. \\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nThere is only one reaction taking place, so the summation reduces to a single term for that reaction.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} + r_1V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficient of A is -1, leading to equation (4). The inlet stream contains only A, so the inlet molar flow rates of B, S, and W are equal to zero. The stoichiometric coefficients of B, S, and W are -1, 1 and 1, respectively. Substitution of those values yields equations (5), (6), and (7).\n\n\n\nEquation (8) is an energy balance on the reacting fluid.\n\\[\n\\breve C_pV \\frac{dT}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot V_{in} \\breve C_p \\left( T - T_{in} \\right)  - r_1  \\Delta H_1 \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.20 with the sensible heat terms written in terms of the known volume-specific heat capacity of the reacting fluid.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\breve C_pV & \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\dot W \\\\ &- \\dot V_{in} \\int_{T_{in}}^T \\breve C_pdT  - V\\sum_j r_j \\Delta H_j\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe pressure is constant, so its derivative with respect to time is equal to zero. The only work being done is that associated with agitating the liquid, and that may be assumed to be negligible. The heat capacity is constant, so it can be taken outside of the integral and the integral can be evaluated. Again, there is only one reaction occurring, so the summation reduces to a single term for that reaction.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\breve C_pV & \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dP}{dt}} - P\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} \\\\ &- \\dot V_{in} \\breve C_p \\left( T - T_{in} \\right)  - r_1 V \\Delta H_1\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nApplying those simplifications results in equation (8).\n\n\n\nThe exchange fluid is removing energy in the form of sensible heat, so an energy balance on that fluid is given by equation (9).\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex} \\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right) \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.2. \\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\nNoting that the heat capacity is constant, it can be taken outside of the integral, and the integral can be evaluated, leading to equation (9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations are IVODEs, so initial values and a stopping criterion must be specified. The instant that the solution containing reagent A begins to flow into the system can be defined as \\(t=0\\) and used as the initial value of the independent variable, \\(t\\). To solve equations (4) through (10), the corresponding initial values of the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(T\\), \\(T_{ex}\\), and \\(V\\), must be specified. In doing so it is imperative to recognize that these are the molar amounts within the reactor, and not the amounts flowing into the reactor.\nInitially the reactor contains only reagent B, so the initial molar amounts of reagents A, S, and W are zero. The initial temperatures of the reacting and exchange fluids and the initial volume of the reacting fluid are given. The initial molar amount of reagent B can be denoted here as \\(n_{B,0}\\).\nA stopping criterion is also needed. Here the problem statement provides the final time.\n\n\n\nInitial Values and Stopping Criterion\n\n\nTable 6.5: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (4) through (9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_f\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(n_{B,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_W\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_S\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T_{ex}\\)\n\\(T_{ex,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(V\\)\n\\(V_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis problem indicates that the reactor initially contained a solution containing B and that the feed was a solution containing A. That implies that there is a solvent in the system, but a mole balance for the solvent was not written. This is quite common for liquid phase reacting fluids. It is possible because the amount of solvent does not change and because the heat capacity of the reacting fluid as a whole was used in the energy balance.\nThe three design equations written here cannot be solved as written. There are 6 IVODEs, but they contain 7 dependent variables (\\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_S\\), \\(n_W\\), \\(T\\), \\(T_{ex}\\), and \\(V\\)). An additional, ancillary ODE is needed that contains at least one of these dependent variables and that does not introduce additional dependent variables. Typically for fed SBSTRs the additional ODE sets the time derivative of the fluid volume, \\(V\\), equal to zero (for gas phase reacting fluids which always fill the entire volume) or to the inlet volumetric flow rate (for idela liquid phase reacting fluids).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.9.4 Modeling a Steady-State CSTR where the Exchange Fluid Phase Changes\nLiquid-phase reaction (1) takes place in an ideal steady-state CSTR. It is exothermic and reversible. The rate expression is given in equation (2) where \\(K_1\\) is the concentration equilibrium constant for reaction (1). The feed is a solution containing A and B at concentrations of \\(C_{A,in}\\) and \\(C_{B,in}\\). There is no Z in the feed. The volumetric feed flow rate is \\(\\dot V_{in}\\) and the feed temperature is \\(T_{in}\\). The reactor volume is \\(V\\) and it operates at a pressure, \\(P\\). Saturated steam at \\(T_{ex}\\) condenses in the reactor jacket which has a volume, \\(V_{ex}\\), heat transfer area, \\(A\\), and heat transfer coefficient, \\(U\\).\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 C_A C_B \\left( 1 - \\frac{C_Z}{K_1 C_A C_B} \\right) \\tag{2}\n\\]\nWrite and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system, including any associated initial values and stopping criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nMole balances are always included among the design equations, so mole balances for each of the three reagents, A, B, and Z, will be written. The reactor is being heated by the condensation of steam, so an energy balance on the reacting fluid is also necessary.\nBecause I know the temperature at which the steam condenses, I know the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid. I’m not asked any other questions about the exchange fluid, so I will not need to include an energy balance on the exchange fluid among the design equations. (Knowing the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, the mole balances and energy balance on the reacting fluid can be solved separately from an energy balance on the exchange fluid.) Neither is a momentum balance needed because this is a CSTR and momentum balances are not used with stirred tank reactors.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nSteady-state mole balances on A, B, and Z are shown in equations (3), (4), and (5).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{A,in} - \\dot n_A - r_1 V \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot n_{B,in} - \\dot n_B - r_1 V \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = - \\dot n_Z + r_1 V \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.24 \\[\n\\frac{V}{\\dot V}\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dt} + \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\\frac{dV}{dt} - \\frac{\\dot n_iV}{\\dot V^2}\\frac{d \\dot V}{dt} = \\dot n_{i,in} - \\dot n_i + V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nThis is a steady-state process, so all of the time derivatives are equal to zero.

The reactor has a diameter, \\(D\\), and length \\(L\\), and operates with negligible pressure drop. The feed to the reactor is 50% A and 50% I, an inert gas, flowing with a volumetric flow rate of \\(\\dot V_{in}\\) at a temperature of \\(T_{in}\\) and pressure of \\(P\\). A liquid coolant flows into the reactor shell at a temperature, \\(T_{ex,in}\\), with a mass flow rate, \\(\\dot m_{ex}\\). It has a mass-specific heat capacity of \\(\\tilde C_{p,ex}\\). The shell volume is \\(V_{ex}\\) and the heat transfer coefficient is \\(U\\).\n\\[\n2 A \\rightarrow A_2 \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1 P_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nWrite and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model this system, including any associated initial values and stopping criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI am asked to formulate a reactor model for this steady-state PFR system with three reagents and one reaction. The reagents in this system are A, A2, and I, so mole balances on each of those reagents must be included among the design equations. Energy balances on the reacting fluid and the exchange fluid must also be included. The problem states that for this particular system, pressure drop is negligible, so a momentum balance will not be added to the design equations.\n\n\n\nReactor Design Equations\nMole balances on A, A2, and I take the forms shown in equations (3), (4), and (5).\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_A}{dz} = -\\frac{\\pi D^2}{2}r_1 \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_{A_2}}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r_1 \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_I}{dz} = 0 \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with Equation 6.32. \\[\n\\frac{\\partial \\dot n_i}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\dot V} \\frac{\\partial\\dot n_i}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\pi D^2\\dot n_i}{4\\dot V^2} \\frac{\\partial \\dot V}{\\partial t}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nThe system operates at steady state, so the time derivatives are equal to zero and the derivative with respect to \\(z\\) becomes an ordinary derivative.

When a steady-state PFR is heated or cooled using sensible heat of the exchange fluid, the energy balance on the exchange fluid will be an ATE while the other design equations are IVODES.

    "text": "7.1 Reactor Response\nConsider a chemical reactor that has been designed and built for the purpose of using known reactions to process a specified fluid mixture. In that situation, the reaction properties and fluid properties are fixed, as are all of the reactor parameters other than the reaction time. In this scenario, setting the reaction time and the reactor inputs results in specific reactor outputs that can be calculated using the reactor design equations. The resulting reactor outputs can be thought of as how the reactor “responds” when the reaction time and reactor inputs are set.\nIn Table 6.1 the reactor outputs were identified as the molar amounts or flow rates of the reagents in the fluid leaving the reactor, the temperature and pressure of that fluid, the temperature of the exchange fluid leaving the reactor and the mechanical work done by the reactor on its surroundings. More generally, any quantity that is related to the reactor outputs can be considered to be a reactor response. Thus, for example, the conversion of a reagent that results after the reactor parameters and reactor inputs are set may be considered to be a reactor response.\nThe reactor design equations are not always solved to find the reactor response. Other quantities of interest can be calculated by solving the reactor design equations. For example, a reaction engineer may be interested in knowing what reactor volume is necessary in order to produced some desired reactor response. In this case, the reactor response is known and the design equations are being solved to find a reactor parameter, i. e. the reactor volume. The key point is that the reactor outputs, and by extension, the reactor response, are related to the reactor inputs and reactor parameters by the reactor design equations. This assumes that properties of the fluids and reactions involved in the process are known."

    "section": "7.2 Reactor Response Function",
    "text": "7.2 Reactor Response Function\nAs stated in the introduction to this chapter, in Reaction Engineering Basics the reactor design equations are solved numerically within a computer function that will be referred to as the (reactor) response function. It was just noted that the reactor design equations are not always solved to find the reactor response, so one may ask why it is called the response function. Without going into details that will be presented later in the book, there are two good reasons for calling it a response function.\nThe first reason is that during the analysis of kinetics data, the design equations are always solved to find the reactor response. When a reaction engineer performs kinetics experiments, they set the reaction time and the reactor inputs, and they measure a reactor response. When the experimental data are subsequently analyzed, the reaction engineer must construct a mathematical model for the experiments. The engineer uses the reactor design equations to model the experiments. The reaction time and reactor inputs used in the experiments are put into the reactor design equations, and the design equations are then solved to find the model-predicted value of the reactor response that was measured in the experiments.\nWith the exception of a steady-state CSTR, when using numerical methods, the reactor design equations must always be solved for a reactor response. Paradoxically, this is true, even when the response is known and the quantity of interest is a reactor parameter or reactor input. The reason why this is true will be described in a later chapter. Put differently, for all ideal reactors other a steady-state CSTR, the reactor design equations must first be solved for a reactor response before any other quantity of interest can be calculated. This is the second reason for calling the function that does this a response function.\nIn general, a reactor response function solves the reactor design equations to find the reactor outputs (i. e. outlet molar amounts outlet temperature and pressure, outlet exchange fluid temperature, and work done on the surroundings). It then uses those results to calculate all other quantities of interest. The quantities of interest may be reactor responses other than the reactor outputs (e. g. conversion, yield, selectivity, etc.) as well as a reactor parameter (e. g. volume) or a reactor input (e. g. feed temperature). Typically a response function is written for a specific reaction engineering analysis or assignment, and its output or return values are the quantities of interest in that analysis or assignment. The general structure of a response function is shown schematically in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Schematic representation of a response function."

    "section": "7.3 Response Function Arguments",
    "text": "7.3 Response Function Arguments\nDepending on the type of analysis being performed and the specifics of that analysis, it may be necessary to pass the values of some quantities to the response function as arguments. In the simplest situation, no arguments are needed, and when called, the response function returns the values of the quantities of interest.\nIn some reaction engineering assignments one or more quantities are varied over a range of values and the reactor design equations must be solved repeatedly using each of the values in that range. In Figure 7.1 the quantities that are varied are called “Adjusted Values.” Typically the adjusted values are passed to the response function as a vector or matrix argument. In this situation, the return values will be a vector or matrix containing the quantities of interest that correspond to each of the adjusted inputs.\nIn other types of reaction engineering analyses and assignments it is not possible to solve the reactor design equations at the outset of the analysis because the values of one or more variables that are needed are not known. In Figure 7.1 these are indicated as “Missing Values.” In these situations, the response function is written with the assumption that the missing values will be passed to the response function when the time comes to solve the design equations.\nWhen the design equations are ATEs, a guess for the unknowns usually must be provided when solving them. In some cases, these guesses can be included within the response function. However, if it becomes necessary to change the guesses, the response function will need to be edited. An alternative approach is to pass guesses to the response function as an argument. This is indicated in Figure 7.1 as “Solver Guesses.”\nFinally it must be noted that in some situations, the response function is passed as an argument to other software. An example where this can occur is in the analysis of kinetics data. Software known as parameter estimation software is used during kinetics data analysis, and the response function must be passed to the parmeter estimation software as an argument. The parameter estimation software may expect the response function to have a specific number and type of arguments in a specific order. In this case, the response function must be written with that number and type of arguments in the order expected by the parameter estimation software.\nIn conclusion, this section has shown that the response functions used in one type of analysis or assignment will differ from the response functions used in other types of analysis. A more detailed description of each variety of response function will be presented in later chapters at the point where they are first needed."

    "section": "8.2 Design of Kinetics Experiments",
    "text": "8.2 Design of Kinetics Experiments\nThe preliminary analysis establishes a range of temperature, pressure and composition that is suitable and appropriate for running the reaction. The purpose of kinetics experiments is to generate experimental data that span that range of temperature, pressure and composition with sufficient resolution to capture how temperature, pressure, and composition affect the rate.\nThe nature of kinetics experiments is relatively straightforward. Selected reactor inputs are adjusted to pre-determined values, and then an output from the reactor, also called the response, is measured. The first step in designing kinetics experiments is to decide which reactor inputs to adjust so that the experiments will span the desired range of temperature, pressure and composition. The inputs that will be adjusted for each of the experiments can be referred to as factors.\nThe first factor to consider is the temperature. Kinetics data are typically generated using small, laboratory-scale reactors. Through the use of a temperature controller, it is usually possible to design the experimental reactor so that it will operate isothermally at a temperature chosen by the reactor operator. A temperature controller is a device that continually monitors the temperature of the reacting fluid and adjusts the amount of heating or cooling provided to the reactor so that the temperature remains constant at the chosen value.\nTypically reaction rates are much more sensitive to temperature than to pressure and composition. The Arrhenius expression indicates an exponential dependence of the rate upon inverse temperature. This is much stronger than the composition dependence found in most rate expressions. Consequently, if composition and temperature are varied simultaneously, the strong temperature effect may mask weaker composition effects. This has two consequences related to kinetics experiments.\nFirst, if at all possible, the reactor should operate isothermally during kinetics experiments. If the temperature is varying, either with time or with location in the reactor, the strong temperature effects may mask weaker composition effects in every single experiment, making it extremely difficult to differentiate between the two. Operating the reactor isothermally eliminates that difficulty. Secondly, it is preferrable to use “blocks” of isothermal experiments where all of the experiments in each block are run at the same temperature and each block uses a different temperature. Then within any one block only the pressure and composition are varying and their effect is more easily ascertained.\nThe second factor to consider is the pressure. For liquid-phase reactions the pressure often does not affect the rate and does not need to be adjusted. For gas-phase reactions it is straightforward to adjust the system pressure from experiment to experiment. Many different reactor inputs can affect the third factor, namely the composition of the reacting fluid in the reactor. For example, in a BSTR experiment the composition can be altered by changing the initial molar amounts of each reactant and product and by changing the reaction time. In a flow reactor the composition can be altered by changing the amounts or inlet flow rates of each reagent, inlet concentrations and total flow rate. It is important to vary the amounts of reactants and products when performing kinetics experiments.\nOnce a set of factors has been identified, that is, once it has been decided which reactor inputs will be adjusted from experiment to experiment, it is necessary to identify the response that will be measured in the experiments. It should be some easily measurable quantity that is related to the change in the composition from start to finish (or inlet to outlet). There are many possibilities including the outlet concentration of a reagent, the conversion of a reactant, an outlet mole fraction of a reagent, etc.\nOnce the response and the adjusted inputs have been chosen, a set of “levels” must be chosen for each of the inputs. These are the values to which the inputs will be adjusted during the experiments. For example, it might be decided to use four temperature levels of 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C. That means that a set of experiments will be conducted at 100 °C, another set at 110 °C, and so on. Things that must be considered when choosing the levels for each input include the time that is available for doing the experiments and the cost of the experiments (purchase of reagents, salaries for technicians performing the experiments, etc.). Sometimes there can be a trade off between the resolution of the experimental data and the time/cost of the experiments. A design with more levels should capture the effect of changing an adjusted input more fully, but it will require more experimental time and cost more. A design with fewer levels will reduce the experimental time required and cost less, but it may not fully capture the effects of changing temperature, pressure, and composition.\nThe kinetics experiments entail adjusting each of the inputs to one of its levels, measuring the corresponding response, adjusting one or more of the inputs to a different one of it levels, measuring the response, etc. The final decision in experimental design involves which combinations of levels to use to generate the kinetics data. There are a few ways to do this. A common one, sometimes called a full factorial design, simply includes every possible combination of the input levels. Example 8.6.1 illustrates full factorial design of kinetics experiments."

    "section": "8.3 Parameter Estimation",
    "text": "8.3 Parameter Estimation\nIt is helpful at this point to make a subtle, but important distinction between what will be called “rate expression parameters” and “rate coefficient parameters.” Rate expression parameters are unknown quantities that appear in the rate expression and either are constant or vary only with temperature. An example is a rate coefficient, \\(k\\). Rate coefficient parameters are unknown constants that appear in expressions for the temperature dependence of rate expression parameters. Examples are the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, \\(k_0\\), and activation energy, \\(E\\), which appear in the Arrhenius expression for the temperature dependence of a rate coefficient.\nThe experimental design described above will lead to a data set where every experiment was performed at one of the chosen temperature levels. For analysis purposes, the data are broken into “blocks” such that all of the experiments at the first temperature level are placed in one block. All of the experiments at the second temperature level are placed in a second block, and so on. Once the data have been grouped into blocks like this, data analysis proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, each data block is processed separately to estimate the values of the rate expression parameters at that block temperature.\nThe result of the first stage of analysis is a set of values for each rate expression parameter at each of the experimental temperature levels. In the second stage of analysis, those results are analyzed to estimate the rate coefficient parameters. For example, the first stage of analysis may yield estimated values for a rate coefficient, \\(k\\), at each experimental temperature level. In the second stage of analysis the \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data are processed to esitmate the Arrhenius parameters, \\(k_0\\) and \\(E\\).\n\n8.3.1 Estimation of Rate Expression Parameters\nThe first stage of analysis starts by writing a model for the reactor (i.e. the design equations) and substituting the rate expression into that model. The rate expression should be written in terms of the rate expression parameters only. For example, the rate expression should contain \\(k\\), and not \\(k_0 \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)}\\). The reactor model is then manipulated to yield an expression relating the measured response to the adjusted inputs which is then fit to the experimental data. Doing this for each of the same-temperature data blocks yields the best values of the rate expression parameters at each temperature level.\nThere are many ways that the reactor model can be manipulated to yield an expression relating the measured response to the adjusted inputs. Three common ways of doing this are considered here. They involve (a) using a response function, (b) using a linearized model, and (c) using an approximate model.\nUsing a Response Function\nChapter 7 described the creation of a response function. Briefly, the response function contains all of the quantities that appear in the design equations that are known and constant. It is passed the values of the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameters to be estimated as arguments. Using that information it solves the design equations numerically. Then it calculates the model-predicted value of the measured response and returns it.\nTo process an experimental data block, parameter estimation software is used. As noted in Chapter 7, the parameter estimation software one chooses to use will expect the response function to have a specific way of receiving its arguments and returning the response. When the response function is created, it must conform to those expectations.\nAs an example, in the Python computer language a function named curve_fit can be used to perform parameter estimation. When curve_fit is called, the response function is passed to it as an argument. The curve_fit function expects that the first argument to the response function will be a matrix containing all of the experimentally adjusted inputs. Each row in the matrix corresponds to one of the adjusted inputs and each column corresponds to one of the experiments. curve_fit further expects that the next arguments will be the unknown rate expression parameters to be estimated, each as a separate argument. Finally, curve_fit expects that the response function will return a row vector where the columns contain the values of the response predicted by the reactor model for each of the experiments.\nTo estimate the parameters for one of the experimental data blocks, one writes a computer code that calls the parameter estimation software, typically passing as arguments the response function, the adjusted inputs, the experimentally measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameters to be estimated. The parameter estimation software the returns the best values of the rate expression parameters.\nPerhaps the most important aspects of using a response function to estimate rate expression parameters are that it can always be used, and it does not introduce any inaccuracies. Among its downsides, it requires writing code, having access to parameter estimation software, and, in most cases, making a guess for the values of the rate expression parameters.\nUsing a Linearized Model\nAs described in Chapter 6 and shown in Example 6.9.1, when a single reaction takes place in an isothermal reactor, the composition of the reacting fluid can be modeled using a single mole balance on any one reactant or product. To use this approach for parameter estimation, a single mole balance on one of the reactants or products must be used to model the reactor. Additionally, if the mole balance is an initial value ordinary differential equation (IVODE), it must be solved analytically to obtain an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE). For steady-state CSTRs, the reactor model will already be an ATE.\nThe ATE model then must be rearranged so that by defining new variables and parameters it becomes a linear equation like that shown in Equation 8.1, where \\(y\\) and the \\(x_i\\) represent the new variables and \\(m_i\\) and \\(b\\) represent the new parameters. The rate expression parameters do not appear in the defining equations for the new variables. Additionally, a unique combination of the rate expression parameters must appear in the defining equation for each slope, \\(m_i\\), and the intercept, \\(b\\). That means that if there is only one rate expression parameter, the linearized reactor model is of the form, \\(y=mx\\), and if there are two rate expression parameters it has the form \\(y=mx+b\\). Generally, when there are \\(n+1\\) rate expression parameters, the form will be as shown in Equation 8.1.\n\\[\ny = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \\cdots + m_nx_n + b\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\nThe adjusted inputs and the measured responses are used to calculate the values of the new variables, \\(y\\) and \\(x_1\\) through \\(x_n\\), for each experiment. Equation 8.1 is then fit to the new variables, e. g. using linear least-squares. If the linearized reactor model has the form \\(y=mx\\) or \\(y=mx+b\\), a spreadsheet can be used to calculate the values of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\), plot the results and fit a linear equation to them. Most spreadsheet programs can be used to estimate \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) by adding a trendline to a plot of \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) and displaying the equation for the trendline on the plot.\nIf the model has two or more \\(x_i\\) variables, linear least squares fitting can still be used, and the calculations can be performed using most spreadsheet programs. Plotting the results, however, is often not possible or useful.\nIn any case, after estimating the best values for the slopes, \\(m_i\\), and intercept, \\(b\\), their defining equations are used to calculate the best values of the rate expression parameters.\nImportantly, it is not always possible to analytically solve mole balances that are IVODEs and it is not always possible to linearize an ATE model equation. As such, this approach cannot always be used. When it can be used, it offers the advantages of using a spreadsheet to analyze the data instead of writing code and it does not require a guess for the values of the rate expression parameters.\nUsing an Approximate Model (Differential Analysis)\nThe third approach to the analysis of a block of experimental kinetics data can only be used when the data are from a BSTR or PFR. The mole balances for a BSTR or a steady-state PFR are IVODEs. In this approach, a single mole balance on one of the reactants or products again is used. In contrast to the first two approaches, that IVODE is not solved directly. Instead, the value of the derivative is approximated, for example using finite differences (see Appendix A). The resulting approximate mole balance is an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE) that typically is then linearized and fit to the experimental data as described above. This approach is also referred to as differential data analysis.\nThere isn’t any real advantage to this approach today, because it is easy to solve the IVODE form of the mole balance numerically using a computer. In the past, however, computers were not as readily available and it was often necessary to solve the mole balance analytically. By using this approach, solving the IVODE mole balance was avoided. While this makes the analysis more tractable, it is not as accurate as solving the IVODE form of the mole balance. Today differential analysis is sometimes used for a quick, preliminary analysis of kinetics data, but the other approaches described in this section are preferred.\n\n\n8.3.2 Estimation of the Rate Coefficient Parameters\nAt the end of the first stage of analysis, values for each of the rate expression parameters will have been estimated at every temperature level that was studied. The second stage of the analysis involves modeling the temperature dependence of each of those parameters.\nThis is relatively easy for rate coefficients and for unknown equilibrium constants that are being treated like rate expression parameters. Both of those kinds of rate expression parameters are expected to exhibit Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, Equation 4.8 and Equation 4.12. Example 4.5.4 illustrates the determination of the pre-exponential factor, \\(k_{0,j}\\), and activation energy, \\(E_j\\), using \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data. The determination of \\(K_{0,j}\\) and \\(\\Delta H^0_j\\) in Equation 4.12 using \\(K\\) vs. \\(T\\) data is analogous.\nModeling the temperature dependence of other types of rate expression parameters such as the exponents in a power-law rate expression is more difficult. Power-law rate expressions are empirical, so there isn’t any theory that predicts how power-law exponents should vary with temperature. Plotting them versus temperature may show that they can be treated as constant, or it may suggest some functional form such as linear or exponential. If an expression for the temperature dependence of empirical rate expression parameters like these cannot be developed, it may be necessary to leave them in tabular form and interpolate to find values at temperatures other than the levels studied in the kinetics experiments. This greatly reduces the utility of the rate expression for reaction engineering purposes."

    "text": "8.4 Accuracy Assessment\nAccuracy must be assessed each time parameter estimation is performed. That is, accuracy should be assessed after the estimation of the rate expression parameters at each temperature. It should also be assessed after each estimation of rate coefficient parameters. For the proposed rate expression to be accepted, the accuracy should be high in all assessments.\nAll of the approaches described above for performing parameter estimation can also be made to yield additional statistics that are useful for assessing the accuracy of the resulting rate expression. These include some measure of the uncertainty in each of the estimated parameters (typically the standard error or a 95% confidence interval) and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). The following criteria indicate an accurate rate expression.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), is close to 1.0.\nThe uncertainty in each parameter is small relative to its value.\n\nThe standard error for the parameter is small relative to its value.\nThe upper and lower extremes of the 95% confidence interval for the parameter are close to the estimated value of the parameter.\n\n\nGraphical assessment of model accuracy is also possible. For linear models with two parameters, this was discussed in Chapter 4 and illustrated in Example 4.5.4. Spreadsheet programs can perform the parameter estimation and generate a model plot, \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) of the linearized equation, with a trendline as described above. If the rate expression is accurate, the experimental data in the model plot will scatter randomly about the trendline. The deviations from the line will be small and there will not be any systematic deviations about the trendline.\nFor every parameter estimation method the estimated parameters can be used to calculate the model-predicted response for each experimental data point. A parity plot of the experimental responses vs. the model-predicted responses can be constructed. Additionally, the difference between each experimental response and the corresponding model-predicted response, i. e. the residuals, can be calculated and plotted against each of the adjusted input variables to get a set of residuals plots. In graphical assessment using these plots, the following criteria suggest that the model is accurate.\n\nThe points in the parity plot are all close to a diagonal line (\\(y_{\\text{expt}} = y_{\\text{model}}\\)).\nIn each residuals plot, the points scatter randomly about zero (the horizontal axis), and no systematic deviations are apparent."

    "text": "8.5 Deciding Whether to Accept the Proposed Rate Expression\nThe final step in kinetics data analysis involves making a decision to accept, reassess with additional data, or reject the proposed rate expression. In the end, this is a judgement call. This becomes easier as a reaction engineer gains experience. The intended use of the rate expression, and more importantly the potential consequences of accepting an inaccurate rate expression, should this decision. That is, if accepting an inaccurate rate expression might result in severe personal injury, significant property damage or catastrophic financial loss, the rate expression should be very, very accurate if it is accepted. If the consequences of accepting an inaccurate rate expression are less severe, somewhat lower accuracy may be deemed acceptable."

    "text": "8.6 Example\n\n8.6.1 Design of Kinetics Experiments\nA rate expression for liquid-phase reaction (1) is needed for the design of a new batch reactor process. Preliminary studies suggest that a temperature in the range of 65 to 90 °C will be needed. At lower temperatures the reaction proceeds to slowly, and at higher temperatures undesired side reactions begin to occur. At a temperature of ca. 80 °C, it takes approximately 30 minutes for the reaction to go to completion. The preliminary experiments suggest that the reaction is irreversible and that the rate is not affected by the concentration of the product, Z. It is expected that the reactant, A, will be available at concentrations between 0.8 and 1.2 M. A perfectly mixed, 1 L BSTR is available for kinetics experiments. The reactor has a sampling port that allows the concentration of A to be measured while the reaction is taking place. Design a set of experiments to generate kinetics data that can be used to develop a rate expression.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI am asked to design kinetics experiments, so I need to decide which variables will be adjusted in the experiments. I further need to decide how many levels to use for each adjusted variable and what those levels should be. The problem states that the rate expression developed using these data will be used to design a new process, so I want to be sure to generate a sizeable data set that spans the expected ranges of the adjusted variables and also captures the effects of each of them upon the response. Based upon the information presented in the problem statement, the experimental response here will be the concentration of A.\nReaction rates can be affected by the temperature and the concentration of each reagent present. Here the problem states that the rate is not affected by the concentration of Z, so the temperature and the concentration of A should vary from one experiment to the next. The reactor is isothermal, so the temperature can be adjusted directly in the experiments. The concentration of A will change as the reaction proceeds. This suggests two ways to vary the concentration of A from experiment to experiment. The first is to adjust the initial concentration of A and the second is to adjust the time at which the response is measured. Longer times will lead to smaller concentrations of A because at longer times more of the A will have reacted. I will use both the initial concentration of A and the reaction time as adjusted variables.\nNext I need to decide how many levels to use for each adjusted variable and what those levels should be. Normally I would use levels that span a slightly wider range than the range where the rate expression will be used. Here, however, I’m told that the rate is too low below 65 °C and undesireable reactions occur above 90 °C, so I will choose levels that just span that range. The range only spans 25 °C, so four temperature levels seem reasonable, as does spacing them equally across the range.\nI want to span a range of concentrations that is slightly wider than the expected range where the rate expression will be used. Three initial concentration levels of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 M will do so. Then, in order to ensure that the data are sensitive to the effect of the concentration of A, I will use six levels of reaction time. Noting that at 80 °C it takes 30 min for the reaction to go to completion, spacing the reaction times 5 minutes apart will lead to samples that span a wide range of conversions.\n\n\n\nExperimental Design\nThree reactor inputs will be adjusted in the experiments: the temperature, \\(T\\), the initial concentration of A, \\(C_{A,0}\\), and the reaction time, \\(t\\). The temperature levels will be 65, 73, 82, and 90 °C; the initial concentration levels will be 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 M; the reaction time levels will be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min. All possible combinations of these levels will be studied giving a total of 72 experimental data points.\nIt will not be necessary to perform 72 experiments, however. Using a reactor at 65 °C with an initial concentration of A equal to 0.5 M, six responses can be recorded in the experiment (at reaction times of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min). The number of experiments needed to record all 72 responses is 12. The initial conditions for those 12 experiments are shown in Table 8.1. Each experiment in the table will yield responses at all six reaction time levels.\n\n\nTable 8.1: Initial conditions for kinetics experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\nT (°C)\nCA,0 (M)\n\n\n\n\n1\n65\n0.5\n\n\n2\n65\n1.0\n\n\n3\n65\n1.5\n\n\n4\n73\n0.5\n\n\n5\n73\n1.0\n\n\n6\n73\n1.5\n\n\n7\n82\n0.5\n\n\n8\n82\n1.0\n\n\n9\n82\n1.5\n\n\n10\n90\n0.5\n\n\n11\n90\n1.0\n\n\n12\n90\n1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSome readers might have difficulty with this problem because it relies upon an understanding of how BSTR kinetics experiments are performed and the data they generate, and that information has not been presented yet. BSTR kinetics experiments are considered in Chapter 9. The important aspects of this example are that it was first necessary to decide which reactor model input variables to adjust, and then it was necessary to decide how many levels of each variable to use and what those levels should be. After doing that, the experimental design simply involves performing an experiment at every combination of the adjusted variable levels."

    "section": "9.1 Laboratory BSTRs",
    "text": "9.1 Laboratory BSTRs\nThe name Batch Stirred Tank Reactor may conjure up a mental image of a BSTR as a cylindrical vessel fabricated from steel, with some means of stirring the contents vigourously. In fact, it is quite possible to use a simple beaker or Erlenmeyer flask placed on a heated magnetic stir plate and equipped with magnetic stir bar as a BSTR. When a round-bottomed flask like that shown in Figure 9.1 is used, the stir bar can be replace by rotating shaft from a motor that extends through a neck and into the flask. The shaft has a paddle on its end that is curved to match the bottom of the flask. As the paddle rotates, it mixes the contents of the reactor. The reactor shown in the figure has two additional necks that can be used, for example, to insert a thermometer and to withdraw samples for analysis. This particular flask has a jacket that surrounds the reactor. A heating or cooling fluid can be circulated through that jacket using the inlet and outlet ports seen on the sides of the vessel. There is also a stopcock at the bottom that can be opened to drain the BSTR when the experiments are complete.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Round-bottomed flask used as a laboratory BSTR.\n\n\nFor higher pressure reactions, a metal “autoclave” can be used. The top of this type of autoclave is a flange with a gasket that can be bolted onto the reactor to seal it for use at higher pressures. Typically autoclaves can be heated or cooled, and they use a shaft and paddle for agitation. Special fittings or magnetic couplings are used so that the rotating shaft can pass into the autoclave without allowing the high pressure contents to leak out.\nIn fact, devices that do not resemble a stirred beaker can also be used as BSTRs for kinetics data generation. The primary requirement is that the contents of the reactor be perfectly mixed. As an example, Figure 9.2 shows a recirculation loop reactor. Fluid is rapidly recirculated in the reactor by a pump. In-line mixing devices can be placed in the flow path to promote thorough mixing of the fluid. The reactor must be operated at a very high recirculation rate, and for isothermal operation, the pump and other components all must be maintained at the same constant temperature. If heterogeneous catalytic reactions are being studied, a packed catalyst bed can be inserted somewhere within the loop. In this case, the amount of reactant converted during a single pass through the bed should be very small so that the compositions at the beginning and at the end of the bed are essentially equal. In this way the composition in the loop will change with time, but within it, the composition will be essentially uniform everywhere, just as the batch reactor model assumes. A recirculation reactor such as that shown in Figure 9.2 is particularly useful for the study of a single gas phase reaction that involves a change in the total number of moles. In such a system, if the initial composition, temperature and pressure are known, the composition at any other time can be found from a measurement of the total pressure. Thus kinetics data can be measured simply by recording the total pressure as a function of time.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Batch recirculation loop reactor schematic.\n\n\nThe stopped flow reactor, shown schematically in Figure 9.3, is a batch reactor that is especially useful for the study of rapid, liquid-phase, bimolecular reactions. Solutions containing the reactants are fed in separate streams to a small mixing chamber. This chamber is designed so that the fluids enter as high velocity jets. The high velocity of these jets causes instantaneous, perfect mixing as the jets enter the reactor. Downstream from the mixing chamber, but still near to it, a detector is located. Typically the detector is a spectrophotometer. This device shines radiation of a given frequency through the fluid and measures how much of the radiation is absorbed. The frequency of the radiation is chosen so that only one of the reactants or products absorbs the radiation. In this way the response from the spectrophotometer is directly proportional to the amount of that one reactant or product. In a typical experiment the fluids begin flowing and a steady state is established. The flow is then stopped instantaneously, and the response of the spectrophotometer is recorded as a function of time. The instant the flow stops, the volume through which the radiation passes becomes a very small batch reactor.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Stopped-flow reactor schematic.\n\n\n\n9.1.1 Testing the Ideality of a BSTR\nBefore a laboratory BSTR is used to generate kinetics data, it should be tested to ensure that it conforms to the assumptions of an ideal BSTR. The most important assumption is that of perfect mixing. If the reactor walls are transparent or if there is a window in the walls, a “smoke test” is a simple way to check the mixing. To perform this kind of test a small amount of colored fluid is added to the reactor. For a gas phase reactor the added fluid is some form of smoke, for a liquid phase system it is often a colored dye. The contents of the reactor are observed at the instant the smoke or dye is added. The smoke or dye should instantaneously mix and fill the entire contents of the reactor. Importantly, there should not be any “corners” or other locations where the color changes slowly. Locations where the color changes slowly are called stagnant zones. They are places where the mixing is not perfect.\nA second way of testing the assumption of perfect mixing involves performing the same experiment several times. Each time the experiment is repeated, the only difference from the other experiments is the rate of agitation. That is, a different stirrer speed or recirculation rate is used in each experiment. As the agitation rate is increased in successive experiments, a point should be reached where the experimental results are identical to the previous experiment. At that rate of agitation, the assumption of perfect mixing can be assumed to be satisfied. In subsequent experiments where kinetics data are being generated, an agitation rate somewhat above that critical rate should then be used."

    "text": "9.2 BSTR Kinetics Experiments and Data\nIn a typical BSTR kinetics experiment, the reactants are first loaded into the reactor; this is also called charging the reactor. If the charge to the reactor has not been pre-heated, then once the reagents are in the vessel, it may be necessary to heat the contents to the desired temperature. If the reaction being studied involves two or more reactants, they can be pre-heated separately to the desired temperature before adding them to the reactor. If a catalytic or enzymatic reaction is being studied, the catalyst or enzyme can be added to start the reaction once the desired temperature has been reached.\nIn any of these situations, as soon as the reactor is charged and has stabilized at the desired temperature, the “initial composition” is analyzed. It is important to recognize that for kinetics data analysis purposes, the initial composition is not necessarily the composition that was charged to the reactor, but the composition at the point when the reactor begins to operate isothermally. The kinetics experiment is taken to begin at this instant, and the elapsed time is measured from that instant. Periodically the elapsed time and some quantity that can be related to the composition (the response) are recorded. Each such measurement represents a single data point. The experimental design dictates how long the reaction is allowed to continue, or equivalently, the number of data points generated before the reaction is terminated. As such, each experiment typically yields multiple data points."

    "section": "9.3 Design of BSTR Experiments",
    "text": "9.3 Design of BSTR Experiments\nThe design of kinetics experiments was considered in Chapter 8 and won’t be repeated here. It was recommended that reactors being used to generate kinetics data should operate isothermally and that experiments should be performed in blocks where all of the experiments in any one block occur at the same temperature. In Reaction Engineering Basics it is always assumed that kinetics data have been generated using an isothermal reactor wherein only one reaction is occurring.\nBriefly, the purpose of kinetics experiments is to generate kinetics data that can be used to develop a rate expression. Generally there will be a critical range of temperatures and critical ranges of the concentration of each reagent within which the rate expression needs to be as accurate as possible. The experiments should be designed so that the temperature and each concentration (or partial pressure) spans its critical range. A factorial design like that described in Chapter 8 and illustrated in Example 8.6.1 can be used.\n\n9.3.1 Adjusted Experimental Inputs\nAs already noted, each BSTR experiment will be isothermal, so one of the experimental adjusted reactor inputs will be the reactor temperature. The number of temperature levels to be used will depend upon the critical range of the temperature. If the rate expression needs to be accurate over a range of 150 °C, a greater number of temperature levels should be studied than if it needs to be accurate over a range of 30 °C.\nIn many cases, the rate of liquid-phase reactions is not affected by total pressure. Nonetheless, the pressure in a liquid-phase system will not change as the reaction proceeds. So if desired, total pressure can be used as a factor for liquid-phase reactions, and different pressure levels can be specified in the experimental design.\nFor gas-phase reactions, the pressure is closely tied to the composition and the total pressure will change as the reaction proceeds if the reaction causes a change in the total number of moles in the system. Since reactor volume and temperature are constant in a BSTR kinetics experiment, the initial composition for a gas phase system is determined by the total pressure and the relative amounts of the reagents.\nTwo experimental inputs affect the composition of the reacting fluid during the experiments. One is the initial composition described above, and the other is the time that has elapsed when the response is measured. In any one experiment, the composition will change continually as the reaction proceeds, so responses measured at different elapsed times during the same experiment will correspond to different compositions. It makes sense to measure the response as many times as possible during each experiment to minimize the time and cost of the experimental study.\nThe number of times the response can be measured may be determined by the time it takes to make the measurement. For example changes in the absorbance of monochromatic radiation can be measured almost continuously, but analysis using gas chromatography may require several minutes per measurement. The temperature of the experiment may also affect the possible number of response measurements. Consider an irreversible reaction. The reaction rate will be greater in experiments where the temperature is higher. As a consequence, the reaction will go to completion in a shorter period of time in higher temperature experiments than in low temperature experiments. That may mean that fewer responses can be measured in a high temperature experiment than in a low temperature experiment.\n\n\n9.3.2 Experimental Responses\nMany different quantities can be used as the experimental response. The only requirement is that it must be possible to relate the measured response to the composition of the system. Obvious choices for the measured response are the concentration or partial pressure of any one reactant or product. Recall from Chapter 3 that knowing the initial molar amounts and any one final amount allows calculation of the apparent extent of reaction, which, in turn allows the calculation of all other final amounts. That said, any quantity that can be used to calculate the apparent extent of reaction is an acceptable response.\nOne other possibility for the measured response from BSTR kinetics experiments is known as the half-life. This response variable is the elapsed time required for the amount of any one reactant to decrease to one-half of its initial value. Measuring the half-life is particularly easy with a stopped-flow reactor like that depicted in Figure 9.3. One simply measures the elapsed time between the instant the flow is stopped and the instant the spectrophotometer signal becomes one-half of its original value. (This assumes that the spectrophotometer signal is linearly proportional to the amount of the reagent absorbing the light.) The analysis of kinetics data where the measured response is the half-life is discussed below."

    "section": "9.4 BSTR Data Analysis",
    "text": "9.4 BSTR Data Analysis\nTwo-stage analysis of kinetics data that were generated using blocks of experiments was described in Chapter 8. The first stage involves the estimation of rate expression parameters, and the second stage involves the estimation of rate coefficient parameters. The present section focuses on applying the first stage analysis to BSTR kinetics data to estimate the values of the rate expression parameters at each temperature level that was studied experimentally.\nThe second stage of analysis involves fitting the Arrhenius expression to rate coefficient data from the first stage of analysis. As such, the second stage is unaffected by the type of reactor used. The second stage of analysis will be included in the first two examples that accompany this chapter, but estimation of pre-exponential factors and activation energies does not depend upon the reactor type and since it has already been described in Chapter 4 and illustrated in Example 4.5.4 it will not be discussed here. Similarly, assessing the accuracy of the resulting rate expression was described in Chapter 8 and will not be repeated here.\nBSTR kinetics experiment are isothermal, and the reaction temperature is known. Under these circumstances the ideal BSTR mole balance, Equation 6.8, is the only design equation needed to model the composition of the reacting fluid. Since only one reaction is taking place, it is not necessary to use an index for the reaction.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\tag{9.1}\\]\n\n9.4.1 Parameter Estimation Using a Response Function\nThe rate expression parameters in a proposed rate expression can always be estimated using a response function. As described in Chapter 8, a response function must be created that is consistent with the parameter estimation software to be used. The response function should contain all of the quantities that appear in the design equations that are known and constant. It should be passed the values of the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameters being estimated as arguments. Using that information it should solve the design equations numerically. Then it should calculate the model-predicted value of the measured response and return it.\nFor a single reaction studied in an isothermal BSTR, the design equations that are solved within the response function consist of Equation 9.1 written for each of the reagents present in the system. This gives a set of initial-value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). This is the only aspect of the response function that is unique to BSTR kinetics data. (As noted in Chapter 6, it is possible to use just one mole balance to model the system if the apparent extent of reaction is used to calculate the amounts of all other reactants and products.)\nThe response function is then used exactly as described in Chapter 8. One writes a computer code that calls the parameter estimation software, typically passing as arguments the response function, the adjusted inputs, the experimentally measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameters to be estimated. The parameter estimation software then returns the estimated values of those parameters.\n\n\n9.4.2 Parameter Estimation Using a Linearized Model\nIn this approach, Equation 9.1 is written for one reactant or product, it does not matter which. It is solved analytically to obtain an integrated form of the reactor model. This is shown in Equation 9.2 where \\(f\\) represents the function obtained upon solving the mole balance analytically. The mole balance may contain the molar amounts of reagents other than \\(i\\). If so, those molar amounts must be expressed in terms of \\(n_i\\) using the apparent extent of reaction before the IVODE can be solved. It isn’t always possible to solve the mole balance analytically; when it isn’t possible, this approach cannot be used.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad n_i = f\\left( n_i, t \\right)\n\\tag{9.2}\\]\nAssuming that the mole balance can be solved to find the function, \\(f\\), the resulting algebraic/transcendental equation (ATE) is re-written so that by defining new variables, it becomes a linear equation. Sometimes this can be done using only algebraic manipulations. When the integrated model equation contains a fraction with multiple terms in the denominator, taking the reciprocal of both sides sometimes leads to a linearized equation. Similarly, if the integrated model equation contains an exponential, taking the natural logarithm of both sides sometimes leads to a linearized equation as in Example 4.5.4 where a linearized version of the Arrhenius expression was fit to experimental rate coefficient data. It isn’t always possible to linearize the integrated reactor model, in which case this approach again can’t be used. If the integrated reactor model can be linearized, it will have the linear form shown in Equation 8.1 and reproduced here.\n\\[\ny = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \\cdots + m_nx_n + b\n\\]\nThe kinetics parameters cannot appear in the defining equation for the new variables, \\(y\\) and the \\(x_i\\). Additionally, the definition of each slope, \\(m_i\\), and the intercept, \\(b\\), must contain a unique combination of the rate expression parameters; it may not contain any adjusted inputs or the response, and it cannot be a known constant. With those restrictions, the total number of slopes and intercepts must equal the number of rate expression parameters.\nAt this point, the analysis proceeds as described in Chapter 8. The primary advantage of this approach is that the linearized model can be fit to the new \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) data using linear least squares. It is not necessary to write a response function, nor to use general parameter estimation software. As noted in Chapter 8, if there are only one or two kinetics parameters in the rate expression, the linearized model, \\(y=mx\\) or \\(y=mx+b\\), also can be fit to the \\(x\\) - \\(y\\) data using a spreadsheet.\n\n\n9.4.3 Parameter Estimation Using an Approximate Reactor Model\nThis approach is often referred to as differential data analysis. Instead of solving the exact mole balance, Equation 9.1, the approximate form shown in Equation 9.3 is used. The primary advantage of this approach is that it converts the reactor model from an IVODE to an ATE. The derivative can be approximated using backward, forward or central differences (see Appendix A). In the past, before computers were readily available, the derivative was also estimated graphically. That is \\(n_i\\) was plotted vs. \\(t\\), a smooth curve was drawn through the data, and the slopes of tangents to that curve were measured and used to approximate the derivative.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V \\approx \\frac{\\Delta n_i}{\\Delta t} = \\nu_i r V\n\\tag{9.3}\\]\nTo complete the analysis, Equation 9.3 is usually re-written so that by defining new variables it becomes a linear equation at which point the remaining analysis is exactly the same as just described. Of course, if Equation 9.3 cannot be linearized, this approach cannot be used.\nAs one might expect, this approach is not as accurate as using the exact reactor model. As the data become noisier (i. e. the greater the random error in the data), the accuracy decreases. If the noise in the data is very small and the intervals between response measurements are also small, the accuracy can approach the accuracy of analysis using the exact reactor model. Nonetheless, analysis using the exact reactor model is generally preferred, while this approach is often used to perform a quick, preliminary analysis.\nOne variation on this approach uses initial rates. The only difference in the initial rate approach is that Equation 9.3 is only applied at the start of the experiment. As a result, each experiment yields only the value of the rate at the initial conditions. This approach is typically applied graphically by plotting the molar amount of \\(i\\) vs. \\(t\\). The initial slope then can be measured graphically. It facilitates a quick, preliminary assessment of possible rate expressions. As personal computers have become popular and available, the use of this approach appears to have declined.\n\n\n9.4.4 Half-life Methods of Analysis\nAnother method that appears to have declined in popularity is the half-life method. It involves measuring the “half-life” of the reaction as described above. The half-life, \\(t_{1/2}\\), is the amount of time that it takes for the concentration of a reactant to decrease to one-half of its initial value. The half-life method is most commonly applied when the rate is expected to depend upon the concentration of a single reactant, e. g. reactant A, in a power-law fashion, Equation 9.4. This rate expression can be substituted into the batch reactor design equation, Equation 9.1, as shown in Equation 9.5.\n\\[\nr_A = - kC_A^\\alpha\n\\tag{9.4}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = - kVC_A^\\alpha = -kV\\left( \\frac{n_A}{V} \\right)^\\alpha = -kV^{1-\\alpha}n_A^\\alpha\n\\tag{9.5}\\]\nEquation 9.5 can be solved by separating the variables and integrating. The lower limit of integration is that the moles of A equal \\(n_{A,0}\\) at \\(t\\) equals zero, and the upper limit of integration is that the moles of A equal \\(0.5n_{A,0}\\) at \\(t\\) equals \\(t_{1/2}\\). If the reaction order, \\(\\alpha\\), is equal to one, the result is given in Equation 9.6; for reaction orders other than one, Equation 9.7 results.\n\\[\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{0.693}{k}\n\\tag{9.6}\\]\n\\[\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\left(2^{\\alpha -1} - 1\\right)}{kC_{A,0}^{\\alpha - 1}\\left( \\alpha - 1 \\right)}\n\\tag{9.7}\\]\nEquation 9.6 and Equation 9.7 suggest that the reaction order, \\(\\alpha\\), can be determined by measuring the half-life in a series of experiments using different initial concentrations of A. If the half-life is the same for all initial concentrations, the reaction is first order. Otherwise, a log-log plot of the half-life vs. the initial concentration should yield a straight line, and the slope should equal \\(1-\\alpha\\) as can be seen by taking the logs of each side of equation Equation 9.7. Note that \\(k\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) were treated as constants in this analysis, so each block of experiments at a single temperature must be evaluated separately."

    "text": "9.5 Examples\nAll of the examples in Chapters 9, 11, and 10 involve using experimental data to estimate the rate expression parameters in a proposed rate expression and then assess its accuracy. Here in Chapter 9 the experimental data have been generated using an ideal BSTR. This type of assignment can be summarized as “kinetics data analysis.” When a reaction engineer is given an assignment, one of the first things they need to do is to identify what type of analysis it requires. Instead of repeating how an expert would identify the type of analysis required in each of the following examples, a single expert thinking callout is provided here. Readers should mentally insert this callout at the start of every example in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking after Reading each Problem Statement in this Chapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves “kinetics data analysis.” I realize that because the problem statement includes 3 distinguishing characteristics of kinetics data analysis assignments.\n\nThe problem statement describes reactor experiments involving a known reaction.\nThe data resulting from performing those experiments are provided.\nThe assignment is to generate a rate expression or estimate the parameters in a proposed rate expression and then assess its accuracy using those data.\n\nI know that the preferred way of performing experiments results in sub-sets (or blocks) of the data that each contain a number of experiments all performed at the same temperature. I further know that when this is true, each same-temperature block is first analyzed separately to estimate values of the kinetics parameters at that block’s temperature.\nThus, to begin this assignment I need to do the following things.\n\nSeparate the experimental data into same temperature blocks.\nIdentify (a) the reactor inputs that were varied from experiment, (b) the reactor response that was measured in each experiment, and (c) the rate expression parameters that need to be estimated for each block.\nDevelop a mathematical model that relates the adjusted inputs to the measured response.\nEstimate the rate expressions parameters for each block and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression for that block.\n\n\n\n\nKinetics data analysis using a response function is preferred in Reaction Engineering Basics because it can always be used, and it does not introduce any inaccuracy. For this reason every example in this chapter illustrates kinetics data analysis using a response function. Example 9.5.1 additionally illustrates kinetics data analysis using an approximate reactor model (differential data analysis). Example 9.5.2 additionally illustrates kinetics data analysis using a linearized model.\nAdditionally, the first two examples in this chapter provides data that can be divided into same-temperature blocks, and they show how the results from analyzing each of those blocks are subsequently used to estimate rate coefficient parameters like the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy that are associated with the temperature dependence of the rate expression parameters.\n\n9.5.1 Differential Analysis of BSTR Kinetics Data\nKinetics data for liquid-phase reaction (1) were generated using an ideal, isothermal, 1 L BSTR. Specifically 12 experiments were performed wherein the temperature and initial concentration of reagent A were set after which the concentration of reagent A was measured at six reaction times, giving a set of 72 experimental data points. The rate expression shown in equation (2), where the rate coefficient is expected to display Arrhenius temperature dependence, has been proposed for this reaction. Assess the accuracy of that first order rate expression using a response function and compare the results to an assessment using a differential data analysis.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = k C_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nNote that these data were generated using the experimental design from Example 8.6.1. and the initial conditions from Table 8.1.

I find it helpful to begin any assignment by summarizing the information provided in the problem statement.\n\n\n\nReactor: BSTR\nGiven: \\(V = 1\\text{ L}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{T}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,0}\\), and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\)\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{C}_{A,\\text{ expt}}\\)\nRate Expression Parameter: \\(k\\)\nThe experiments were performed at one of four temperature levels, so four same-temperature blocks of data can be created from the full data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment asks me to perform the data analysis twice. The information above applies for both analyses. I’ll do the analysis using a response function first. To create a response function I need to first write the design equations for the reactor. Since the experimental reactor was isothermal, only the mole balance design equations are needed to model the reactor.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.5.1.1 Analysis using a Response Function\nReactor Model\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\n\nTable 9.2: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3) and (4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{rxn}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen only one reaction takes place in a BSTR, the mole balance design equation is given by equation Equation 9.1. Substitution of the stoichiometric coefficients of A (-1) and Z(+1) gives equations (3) and (4).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThe instant the reaction starts can be defined as \\(t=0\\). The moles of reagent A at that instant can be represented by \\(n_{A,0}\\). The assignment states that the concentration of A was set, so presumably reagent Z was not present, i. e. the molar amount of reagent Z at \\(t=0\\) is zero. The response was measured at \\(t_{rxn}\\), so the stopping criterion is \\(t=t_{rxn}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is \\(t\\) and the dependent variables are \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_Z\\). In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.\nIn this assignment the volume is a known constant. When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the rate coefficient and the concentration of A. The rate coefficient will be known at the time the IVODEs are solved, but an expression for the concentration of A is needed. The defining equation for concentration in a closed system is the necessary equation.\nLooking at the initial values, the assignment provides the initial concentration of A. Again the defining equation for concentratio can be used to calculate the initial molar amount of reagent A. The final time, \\(t_{rxn}\\) is provided in the assigment and will be available when the IVODEs are solved.\nSo, I need ancillary equations to calculate the concentration of A and the initial molar amount of A using known constants, \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), and \\(n_Z\\).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = C_{A,0}V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response function will receive the adjusted inputs (\\(\\underline{T}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,0}\\), and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\)) and the rate expression parameter (\\(k\\)) as arguments. With that, the design equations can be solved numerically using the information just presented.\nSolving the design equations will yield \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_Z\\) at the time the response was measured, \\(t_{rxn}\\). The measured response was the concentration of A, which must be calculated next and returned. Equation (5) can be used to calculate it.\n\n\n\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure:\n\nThe adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{T}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,0}\\), and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\), and the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), are passed to it as arguments.\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities. For example, in this case the variable V can be defined and assigned a value of 1.0 to represent the known reactor volume, \\(V = 1\\text{ L}\\).\nA function that evaluates the design equations given values of the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\) and \\(n_Z\\) is defined. It\n\nCalculates \\(C_A\\) using equation (5).\nCalculates \\(r\\) using equation (2).\nEvaluates and returns the derivatives, equations (3) and (4).\n\nFor each experiment the response function\n\nCalculates \\(n_{A,0}\\) using equation (6).\nSolves the design equations using the initial values and stopping criterion in Table 9.2 to find \\(n_A\\) at \\(t_{rxn}\\).\nCalculates \\(C_A\\) at \\(t_{rxn}\\) using equation (5).\n\nThe values of \\(C_A\\) for all of the experiments are returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving created the response function, I can now use it to estimate the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), at each of the experimental temperature levels. To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. I will exectute this program using each of the same-temperature data blocks, and it will return the best estimate for \\(k\\), some measure of the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), for each experimental temperature level.\nUsing the resulting value of \\(k\\) for each data block, I then can calculate the model-predicted response and the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each experiment. Then, as described in Chapter 8, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created.\nTo complete the analysis, I will fit the Arrhenius expression to the resulting \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data. (see Example 4.5.4)\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nFor each temperature level used in the experiments:\n\nPass the response function, the adjusted inputs for that temperature, and the experimental responses for that temperature to parameter estimation software to find \\(k\\), the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), for that temperature.\nUse the resulting value of \\(k\\) to create a parity plot (\\(C_{A,\\text{ expt}}\\) vs. \\(C_{a,\\text{ model}}\\)) and residuals plots (\\(C_{A,\\text{ expt}}\\) - \\(C_{A,\\text{ model}}\\) vs. \\(C_{A,0}\\) and vs. \\(t_{rxn}\\)) for that temperature.\n\nFit the Arrhenius expression to the \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data from step 1a. (see Section 4.5.4)\n\nResults\nThe parameter estimation results are listed in Table 9.3. Figure 9.4 shows the parity plots, Figure 9.5 shows the residuals plots for \\(C_{A,0}\\), and Figure 9.6 shows the residuals plots for \\(t_{rxn}\\).\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.3: Parameter estimation results using the response function.\n\n\nT (°C)\nk\nR2\n\n\n\n\n65\n0.013 min-1, 95% CI [0.0129, 0.0132]\n1\n\n\n73\n0.0232 min-1, 95% CI [0.0229, 0.0234]\n1\n\n\n82\n0.0422 min-1, 95% CI [0.0419, 0.0425]\n1\n\n\n90\n0.0697 min-1, 95% CI [0.069, 0.0704]\n0.999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Parity plots from parameter estimation using a response function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Residuals plots for \\(C_{A,0}\\) from parameter estimation using a response function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Residuals plots for \\(t_{rxn}\\) from parameter estimation using a response function.\n\n\nThe Arrhenius expression was fit to the rate coefficients shown in Table 9.3 with the following results.\nk0: 4.96 x 108 min-1, 95% CI [2.57 x 108, 9.57 x 108]\nE: 68.5 kJ mol-1, 95% CI [66.6, 70.4]\nR2: 1\nThe Arrhenius plot is shown in Figure 9.7.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Arrhenius plot for rate coefficients estimated using the response function.\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn assessing the accuracy I need to consider the fit of the model to the data for each of the experimental temperature levels and the fit of the Arrhenius expression to the resulting \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data. The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), is extremely close to 1.0 in all cases, indicating high accuracy. In the four parity plots, Figure 9.4, and in the Arrhenius plot, Figure 9.7, the experimental data points are all close to the line representing the model, again indicating an accurate model. In the residuals plots, Figure 9.5 and Figure 9.6, and the Arrhenius plot, Figure 9.7, the experimental data points scatter randomly about the line representing the model with no apparent systematic trends in the deviations. This, too, suggests an accurate model. Finally, for each estimated parameter, the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals are very close in value to the estimated parameter. That is, the uncertainty in the estimated parameters is small, yet again indicative of an accurate model.\n\n\n\nThe coefficients of determination, parameter uncertainties, parity plots, residuals plots and Arrhenius plot all indicate that rate expression in equation (2) is very accurate when the Arrhenius expression is used to represent the temperature dependence of \\(k\\). Equation (2) should be accepted as the rate expression with 4.96 x 108 min-1 as the pre-exponential factor and 68.5 kJ mol-1 as the activation energy.\n\n\n\n9.5.1.2 Differential Data Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that in a differential data analysis the mole balance design equation 9.1, is approximated using Equation 9.3. Here I will use backwards differences for the approximation, (see Appendix A).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V \\approx \\frac{\\Delta n_i}{\\Delta t} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nI then need to substitute the rate expression into the approximate design equation for one of the reactants or products and linearize the resulting equation. There is only one rate expression parameter, so the linearized response model will take the form \\(y=mx\\).\nFor each block of same-temperature data, I will need to calculate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) using the experimental data and then estimate the value of \\(m\\). This can all be done using a spreadsheet, if desired. That will yield values of \\(k\\) at each of the experimental temperature levels. The Arrhenius expression can then be fit to the resulting estimated \\(k\\) values.\nHere I will write the mole balance on A, substituting its stoichiometric coefficient (-1) and the rate expression, equation (2).\n\n\n\nApproximate Reactor Model\n\\[\n\\frac{n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i} - n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{i-1}}}{t_i - t_{i-1}} = -k C_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i} V \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at equation (7), I see that it already has a linear form.\n\n\n\nLinearized Response Model\nDefining \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as shown in equations (8) and (9), it can be seen that equation (7) has the linear form shown in equation (10).\n\\[\nx = C_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i} V \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i-1} - n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i}}{t_i - t_{i-1}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\ny=kx \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to calculate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experimental data point. The values of \\(V\\), \\(t_i\\), \\(t_{i-1}\\), and \\(C_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i}\\) are known, so expressions to calculate \\(n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_i}\\) and \\(n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{i-1}}\\) are needed.

That is, the uncertainty in the estimated parameters is small. It is not uncommon for the uncertainty in pre-exponential factors to be relatively large.\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficients of determination, parameter uncertainties, parity plots, residuals plots and Arrhenius plot all indicate that rate expression in equation (2) is accurate when the Arrhenius expression is used to represent the temperature dependence of \\(k\\). Equation (2) should be accepted as the rate expression with 3.95 x 109 min-1 as the pre-exponential factor and 74.2 kJ mol-1 as the activation energy.\n\n\n9.5.1.3 Comparison\nThe accuracy criteria suggested that the model obtained using differential analysis and that obtained using a response function were both sufficiently accurate to accept. However, the parameter estimates from the two analyses were not equal. The model that resulted from the differential analysis appears to be less accurate than that resulting from analysis using a response function. In particular in the differential analysis the coefficients of determination are not as close to 1.0, there is more scatter in the model plots (compared to the parity plots), and the uncertainty in the estimated parameters is greater.\nThe same data and the same rate expression were used in both analyses. They differed in the reactor models used. Not surprisingly, the results with the greater uncertainty were obtained using an approximate reactor model. In general, analysis should be performed using the true reactor model (i. e. using a response function) to avoid the additional uncertainty resulting from the use of an approximate model.\n\n\n\n9.5.2 Analysis Using a Linearized Reactor Model\nThe gas-phase reaction between reagents A and B was studied in an ideal, isothermal, 500 cm3 BSTR. In all experiments the reactor was charged with reagents A and B only, but with varying partial pressures. The fractional conversion of reagent A was measured at seven different elapsed times in each experiment. Experiments were performed at three different temperatures. A total of 189 data points were recorded. Use a linearized reactor model to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2) and compare the results to an analysis using a response function. \\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = k P_A P_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 9.5.

The moles of reagents A and B at that instant can be represented by \\(n_{A,0}\\) and \\(n_{B,0}\\). The assignment states that the reactor was charged with only reagents A and B, so reagents Y and Z were not present, i. e. their molar amounts at \\(t=0\\) are zero.

When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate them.\nThe initial molar amounts of A and B are not provided in the assignment, either. They also can be calculated using the ideal gas law since the assignment does provide their initial partial pressures.\nThus, I need ancillary equations to calculate the \\(P_A\\), \\(P_B\\), \\(n_{A,0}\\), and \\(n_{B,0}\\) using known constants, \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), and \\(n_Z\\).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nP_A = \\frac{n_ART}{V} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_B = \\frac{n_BRT}{V} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = \\frac{P_{A,0}V}{RT} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{B,0} = \\frac{P_{B,0}V}{RT} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design equations will be solved within a response function to obtain the values of \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), and \\(n_Z\\) at \\(t=t_{rxn}\\).

To do so I will use parameter estimation software of my choosing. I will write a simple program that passes the adjusted inputs, the measured responses, and a guess for the rate expression parameter to that parameter estimation software. I will exectute this program using each of the same-temperature data blocks, and it will return the best estimate for \\(k\\), some measure of the uncertainty in \\(k\\), and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), for each experimental temperature level.\nUsing the resulting value of \\(k\\) for each data block, I then can calculate the model-predicted response and the residual (difference between the measured response and the model-predicted response) for each eperiment. Additionally, as described in Chapter 8, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created.\nTo complete the analysis, I will fit the Arrhenius expression to the resulting \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data.

That means I must use a single mole balance on one of the products or reactants to model the reactor. (Because the reactor is isothermal, I can solve the mole balance independently of the energy balances.) The response in this problem is the fractional conversion of reagent A, so I’ll write the mole balance on reagent A.\nThe mole balance will be a differential equation. I know that I will need to solve that IVODE analytically before I’ll be able to linearize the model.\n\n\n\nLinearized Reactor Model\nA mole balance on reagent A is shown in equation (12), where the rate expression, equation (2) has been substituted into the mole balance.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_AP_B \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to solve equation (12) analytically before I can linearize it. To do that, I need to express every variable quantity appearing in it in terms of the dependent variable, \\(n_A\\), and the independent variable \\(t\\). In any one experiment, \\(k\\) and \\(V\\) will be constant, but \\(P_A\\) and \\(P_B\\) will change as the reaction proceeds. Consequently, I need to express \\(P_A\\) and \\(P_B\\) in terms of \\(n_A\\) and \\(t\\).\n\n\n\nUsing the ideal gas law, the partial pressures can be eliminated, equation (13).\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kV\\left( \\frac{n_ART}{V} \\right)\\left( \\frac{n_BRT}{V} \\right) = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}n_An_B \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressing \\(P_B\\) using the ideal gas law introduced the molar amount of B, \\(n_B\\). Next it must be expressed in terms of \\(n_A\\) and \\(t\\). This can be accomplished using the apparent extent of reaction (see Chapter 3).\nStart by expressing the molar amount of reagent B in terms of its initial amount and the apparent extent of the reaction.\n\\[\nn_B = n_{B,0} - \\xi\n\\]\nThen express \\(\\xi\\) in terms of the molar amount of reagent A.\n\\[\nn_A = n_{A,0} - \\xi \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad \\xi = n_{A,0} - n_A\n\\]\nSubstuting the second expression into the first gives an expression for the molar amount of reagent B.\n\\[\nn_B = n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A\n\\]\n\n\n\nAfter expressing the molar amount of B in terms of the molar amount of A, equation (14) results.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}n_A\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \\right) \\tag{14}\n\\]\nSeparation of variables and integration then leads to equation (15).\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_{A,0}-n_{B,0}} \\ln{\\frac{n_{A,0}\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \\right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\tag{15}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See Where That Came From\n\n\n\n\n\nRearrange equation (15) so only \\(n_A\\) appears on the left side and only \\(t\\) appears on the right.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{n_A\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \\right)} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}dt\n\\]\nThen integrate noting that at \\(t=0\\), \\(n_A = n_{A,0}\\), at any later time, \\(t\\), the molar amount of reagent A is \\(n_A\\), and \\(k\\), \\(R\\), \\(T\\), and \\(V\\) are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.\n\\[\n\\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\\frac{dn_A}{n_A\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A \\right)} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}\\int_{t_0}^tdt\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \\left(\\ln{\\frac{ n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  }{n_A}}\\right)\\Bigg\\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\Big\\vert_{t_0}^t\n\\]\nEvaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at equation (15), I can see that the first fraction will become infinite if \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\), and some of the experiments have equal initial partial pressures of reagents A and B. If \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\) then \\(n_A\\) will equal \\(n_B\\) at all times because one A is consumed every time one B is consumed in the reaction. In this case, the rate expression becomes \\(r=kP_A^2\\), so the reactor model is as follows.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -kVP_A^2\n\\]\nRearrange so only \\(n_A\\) appears on the left side and only \\(t\\) appears on the right.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}dt\n\\]\nThen integrate noting that at \\(t=0\\), \\(n_A = n_{A,0}\\), at any later time, \\(t\\), the molar amount of reagent A is \\(n_A\\), and \\(k\\), \\(R\\), \\(T\\), and \\(V\\) are constants that can be taken outside of the integral.\n\\[\n\\int_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A}\\frac{dn_A}{n_A^2} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V}\\int_{t_0}^tdt\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{-1}{n_A}\\Bigg\\vert_{n_{A,0}}^{n_A} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\Big\\vert_{t_0}^t\n\\]\nEvaluating at the upper and lower limits and taking the difference on each side then yields equation (16), below.\n\n\n\nIf \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\), separation of variables and integration leads to equation (16).\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \\frac{1}{n_A} = \\frac{-k\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} t\\tag{16}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone just starting to learn about kinetic data analysis might not have noticed that the initial fraction in equation (15) will become infinite if \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\). In that case, the analysis would have failed a little later, indicating that something was wrong. Eventually the new learner might figure out the problem, but this is one of those times when a little prior experience (or the ability to ask a teacher who has such experience) really helps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving solved the mole balance ODE, the next step is to linearize it. In this problem nothing needs to be done. It is already linear. That means that I next need to calculate the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experimental data point.\n\n\n\nIf \\(y\\) is defined as shown in equation (17) for experiments where \\(n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}\\), or as shown in equation (18) when \\(n_{A,0} \\ne n_{B,0}\\), and \\(x\\) is defined as shown in equation (19), it can be seen that the model for both cases is a linear equation with a slope equal to \\(k\\), equation (20).\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{n_{A,0}} - \\frac{1}{n_A} \\tag{17}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\frac{1}{n_{B,0}-n_{A,0}} \\ln{\\frac{n_{A,0}\\left( n_{B,0} - n_{A,0} + n_A  \\right)}{n_{B,0}n_A}} \\tag{18}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-t\\left(RT\\right)^2}{V} \\tag{19}\n\\]\n\\[\ny=kx \\tag{20}\n\\]\nAncillary Equations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that I have a linearized model, I need to calculate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for every experiment and then fit equation (20) to the resulting data. Looking at equations (17) through (19) I see that to calculate \\(y\\) I will need the initial molar amounts of reagents A and B and the final amount of reagent A. The initial molar amounts can be calculated using equations (9) and (10), but I need an equation for \\(n_A\\). The initial amount of A and its conversion are known, and can be used to calculate \\(n_A\\).\n\n\n\n\\[\nn_A = n_{A,0} \\left( 1 - f_A \\right) \\tag{21}\n\\]\nCalculations\n\nFor each temperature level used in the experiments:\n\nCalculate \\(n_{A,0}\\), \\(n_{B,0}\\), and \\(n_A\\) using equations (9), (10), and (21).\nCalculate the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for each experiment using equations (17) or (18) and equation (19).\nUsing a spreadsheet or linear least squares software, fit equation (20) to the resulting data.\nUse the resulting value of \\(k\\) to create a model plot (\\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) as points and the model, \\(y=kx\\), as a line) for that temperature.\n\nFit the Arrhenius expression to the \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data from step 1c.

This is expected because the same data set and rate expression were used, and neither of the reactor models introduces any approximations. Recall, when a differential analysis was used in Example 9.5.1, there was greater uncertainty in the parameters obtained by differential analysis because differential data analysis uses an appeoximate mole balance equation.\nAnalysis using a linearized model, as in this example, is just as accurate as analysis using a response function. The only issues associated with using a linearized model are that for some rate expressions it may not be possible to solve the mole balance design equation analytically, and when it can be solved analytically, it may not be possible to linearize it. Analysis using a response function can always be used.\n\n\n\n9.5.3 A Gas-Phase Reaction With Total Pressure as the Response\nAn ideal, 100 cm3, isothermal BSTR was used to generate kinetics data for reaction (1) at several temperatures. In a typical experiment at any one temperature, reagent A was added to the reactor at that temperature and a pressure of \\(P_{A,0}\\). Then, to begin the reaction, a sufficient amount of reagent B at the same temperature was added instantaneously to bring the total pressure to 6.0 atm. The reaction progress was followed by recording the total pressure once per minute for 24 min after the addition of reagent B.

It describes reactor experiments, provides the data from those experiments, and asks me to assess the accuracy of a proposed rate expression. I will solve it using a response function. The response function will be passed the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameters as arguments, so I will start by summarizing the information provided in the assignment and identifying those quantities.\n\n\n\nReactor Type: BSTR\nGiven Constants: \\(V=100 \\text{ cm}^3\\), \\(P_0=6 \\text{ atm}\\), \\(T=275\\text{ °C}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{P}_{A,0}\\) and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\)\nExperimental Responses: \\(\\underline{P}\\)\nRate Expression Parameter: \\(k\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the response function, I’ll first need to solve the reactor design equations, so I’ll begin by generating the design equations and formulating their solution. Here the reactor is a stirred tank, so there isn’t a momentum balance. Furthermore, the reactor operates isothermally, so I can solve the mole balance design equations independently of the energy balance design equations. For an isothermal BSTR with only one reaction taking place, the general form of the mole balance design equation is given in Equation 9.1.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThis system has 3 reagents, A, B, and Z, and their stoichiometric coefficients are -1, -1, and 1, respectively. With that knowledge, I can write the mole balances. Defining \\(t=0\\) as the instant reagent B is added and the reaction starts, I can let \\(n_{A,0}\\) and \\(n_{B,0}\\) represent the molar amounts of A and B present at \\(t=0\\), noting that reagent Z is not present at that instant. The response is measured at specific times, \\(t_{rxn}\\), so the stopping criterion is \\(t=t_{rxn}\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balance design equations for A, B, and Z are presented in equations (3), (4), and (5).

The independent variable is \\(t\\) and the dependent variables are \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\) and \\(n_Z\\). In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables.\nThe design equations will be solved within a response function so that the adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{P}_{A,0}\\) and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\), and the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), will be available. When the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. The ideal gas law can be used to calculate them.

Three experiments were performed. The temperature was the same in all three experiments, but the initial concentration of substrate S (mmol L-1) differed. At the start of each experiment product P was not present in the reactor. The reaction takes place in aqueous solution, so the concentration of water may be assumed to be constant. The concentration of product P (mmol L-1) was measured at 10 min intervals during 2 h of reaction in each of the experiments.

I need to write a reactor model (see Chapter 6), use it to create a reactor response function (see Chapter 7 and above), and use that to fit the reactor model to the experimental data (see Appendix J).\nFor an isothermal reactor, the mole balances can be solved independently of the other reactor design equations. In this problem there are three reagents, the substrate S, the product P, and water. However, as the assignment notes, the concentration of water is essentially constant, so I don’t need a mole balance on it. I will use Equation 9.1, reproduced below, to write mole balance on reagents S and P, noting that their stoichiometric coefficients are -1 and 1, respectively.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThose mole balances are IVODEs, so I need initial values and a stopping criterion to solve them. Letting \\(t=0\\) be the time when the reaction started (presumably when the enzyme was added to a solution of substrate), then the stopping criterion for each experiment is \\(t=t_{rxn}\\). I will let \\(n_{S,0}\\) represent the molar amount of substrate at \\(t=0\\). The assignment states that product P was not present at \\(t=0\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on the substrate S and the product P are presented in equations (3) and (4).

The design equations are IVODEs. The independent variable is \\(t\\) and the dependent variables are \\(n_S\\) and \\(n_P\\). In order to solve those IVODEs numerically I need to go through the design equations, initial values and stopping criterion and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets subtituted into them, in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. The adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{C}_{S,0}\\) and \\(\\underline{t}_{rxn}\\), and the rate expression parameters, \\(V_{max}\\), and \\(K_m\\), will be available.\nWhen the rate expression, equation (2) is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the concentration of S. The defining equation for concentration in a closed system, Equation 1.7, can be used to express the concentration of S in terms of the molar amount of S.\nThe initial molar amount of S is not provided in the assignment, either, but the initial concentration is. Consequently, the definition of concentration can be used to calculate the initial molar amount of reagent S.\nSo in summary, I need ancillary equations to calculate \\(C_S\\) and \\(n_{S,0}\\), using known constants, \\(t\\), \\(n_S\\), and \\(n_P\\).\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nC_S = \\frac{n_S}{V} \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{S,0} = C_{S,0}V \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the design equations have been solved within the response function, the predicted value of the response variable must be calculated and returned.

    "title": "10  Analysis of Kinetics Data from a PFR",
    "section": "10.1 Laboratory PFRs",
    "text": "10.1 Laboratory PFRs\nIn its most basic form, a PFR is simply a length of rigid tubing or pipe. Reagents flow in at one end and out at the other. The key assumption of the PFR model is that of plug flow. As explained in Chapter 6 and Appendix G, the fluid flow velocity is constant across the tube diameter in plug flow. There is no mixing in the axial direction, and perfect mixing in the radial direction. Thus, in contrast to stirred tank reactors, the composition varies spatially in a PFR. That is, as one moves from the reactor inlet to the reactor outlet, the concentrations of reactants decrease and those of products increase. (The temperature and pressure can also vary along the length of a PFR, but when generating kinetics data the reactor usually operated isothermally and with negligible pressure drop).\nA second difference between PFRs and stirred tank reactors is that there is no agitation in PFRs. For this reason, PFRs are very often used to generate kinetics data for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Recall, a heterogeneous catalyst is a material that exists as a separate phase from the reacting fluid and that causes the rate of one or more reactions to increase. Most commonly heterogeneous catalysts are porous solids that are immersed in the reacting fluid. It is difficult to agitate the solid particles if a stirred tank reactor is used, though this has been done. When a heterogeneous catalytic reaction is studied in a PFR, the catalyst is typically contained within the reactor tube as a stationary packed bed through which the reacting fluid flows. A section of pipe filled with small pellets or beads that are held in place by screens or other means offers a good mental picture of a packed bed.\nThe ideal PFR mole, energy and momentum balances can be used to model a packed bed reactor. To do so, the combined packed bed and reaction fluid are treated as if they are a single, homogeneous fluid. The most important assumption that this introduces to the analysis is that there are no concentration or temperature gradients at the interface between the solid and fluid phases or within the pores of the solid. In reality, there will be concentration and temperature gradients between the bulk of the fluid and the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst particles, and there will be gradients within the pores of the catalyst particles. This topic is considered in more detail in Chapter 17. For present purposes, the important point is that these gradients must be negligibly small if the PFR mole, energy and momentum balances from Chapter 6 are used to model the reactor.\n\n10.1.1 Testing the Ideality of a PFR\nBefore a PFR is used to generate kinetics data, it should be tested to ensure it conforms to the asumptions of an ideal PFR. Importantly, it should be tested for plug flow, and if it is a packed bed, it should be tested for negligible concentration and temperature gradients.\nTesting for plug flow is not easy. As noted in Appendix A, in laminar flow the radial velocity profile is parabolic, and it flattens as the flow becomes turbulent. The Reynolds number, \\(N_{Re}\\), offers a measure of how turbulent the flow is. It can be computed using Equation 10.1. In cylindrical pipes, a Reynolds number greater than ca. 3500 indicates turbulent flow; a much greater Reynolds number is needed in order to approach plug flow.\n\\[\nN_{Re} = \\frac{\\rho vD}{\\mu}\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\nSmoke- or dye-based flow visualizations are useful for gauging the mixing in an agitated vessel, but they are difficult to apply for gauging plug flow. A related approach involves measuring the residence time distribution or age function for the reactor. Doing so is described in Chapter 23. The measured age distribution function can then be compared to that expected for plug flow to determine whether plug flow prevails in the reactor.\nAs noted above, when a tubular reactor contains a packed bed of solid particles, gradients in concentration and temperature can exist within the fluid that is close to the surface of the solid particles. When present, these are referred to as external gradients because they are external to the solid material. A common experimental test for external mass transfer limitations (i. e. for non-negligible external concentration gradients) in a packed bed reactor relies on the fact that for an ideal PFR, the conversion depends only upon the residence time within the reactor and not the linear velocity of the flowing fluid. The external mass transfer coefficient, in contrast, does depend upon the linear velocity of the flowing fluid. Thus, if the conversion changes when the linear velocity is changed while holding the residence time constant, this indicates that the apparent rate is being affected by the rate of external mass transfer.\nOne approach to this test is to measure the conversion at varying fluid velocities with a fixed amount of catalyst and plot the conversion versus the residence time. The experiment is then repeated using a different amount of catalyst. In the absence of mass transfer limitations, the plots should superimpose. An alternative approach is to measure the conversion with a given amount of catalyst and at a given fluid flow rate. The conversion is then measured again using a different amount of catalyst, but with a flow rate that gives the same residence time as in the first experiment. In the absence of external mass transfer limitations, the conversions should be equal. Care should be taken in applying this test, however, because at the very low Reynolds numbers that are often used in laboratory reactors, the mass transfer coefficient depends very weakly upon the fluid velocity (Chambers and Boudart 1966).\nWhen external mass transfer limitations are very severe, a first-order rate expression, Equation 10.2, will be found to fit the experimental data very well. In this case it is more appropriate to refer to Equation 10.2 as the apparent rate expression because the rate it refers to is the rate of external mass transfer and not the rate of reaction. The true rate expression can be first-order, but when external mass transfer limitations are severe, the apparent activation energy, \\(E\\), will be very low (≲ 10 to 15 kJ mol-1). True reaction rates typically have activation energies that are greater than this. This can serve as a warning indicator when kinetics data are being analyzed. If the reaction kinetics are observed to change to first order and the activation energy is simultaneously observed to become small, the kinetics data may contain experiments where external transport limitations existed. There are also computational tests for external transport limitations that can be applied (Mears 1971; Satterfield 1980; Wheeler 1951).\n\\[\nr=k_0\\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E}{RT} \\right)}C_i\n\\tag{10.2}\\]\nMost heterogeneous catalysts are porous solids with very high specific surface areas. Most of this surface area is internal and corresponds to the walls of pores (picture the catalyst interior as looking like a microscopic sponge). The only way for reactants to reach the majority of the catalytic sites is to diffuse into the pore structure. If the rate of the reaction at the active sites is large, this can lead to the formation of significant internal concentration gradients within the pores. For present purposes, the goal is to be able to identify experimental conditions where these gradients are insignificantly small. As a general rule of thumb, internal concentration gradients are more likely than external concentration gradients.\nOne experimental test for the presence of internal heat or mass transfer limitations is to repeatedly measure the conversion using finer and finer catalyst particle sizes. In the absence of internal gradients, the conversion should not depend upon the particle size, but if gradients are present, their effects should diminish as the particle size is decreased. This happens because the diffusional path length becomes smaller as the particle size is decreased. Koros and Nowak (1967) suggest a test where the catalyst is prepared from two powders that are mixed and formed into catalyst pellets. One powder is inert while the other is catalytic. Two or more sets of pellets are prepared using different ratios of the powders. In the absence of internal gradients, the ratio of the observed rates should equal the ratio of amounts of the active powders used to prepare the catalysts. Madon and Boudart (1982) describe a similar test where the catalyst comprises very small active catalyst nanoparticles supported on a porous oxide carrier.\nThere are also a few computational tests for the presence of intraparticle temperature or concentration gradients. For an isothermal reaction, Equation 10.3 can be used to calculate \\(\\phi_s\\). For a zero-order reaction, the effects of concentration gradients in the pores will be negligible if \\(\\phi_s\\) is less than 6. For first order reactions it should be less than 1, and for second order reactions it should be less than 0.3.\n\\[\n\\phi_s = \\frac{r_p^2\\left( -r \\right)}{D_{\\text{eff}}C_i}\n\\tag{10.3}\\]"

    "text": "10.2 PFR Kinetics Experiments and Data\nFrom an operational viewpoint, the procedure for performing kinetics experiments using a PFR is exactly the same as the procedure used with a CSTR. Each experiment will yield a single data point. As with the stirred tank reactors, experiments should be performed in blocks where all of the experiments in a block are performed at the same temperature to prevent the generally strong temperature dependence of reaction rates from masking weaker composition and pressure effects. Similarly, the PFR should operate at steady state so that the temperature of the reacting fluid is constant. Doing so allows kinetics data analysis using only the PFR mole balance design equations (as long as the pressure drop along the length of the reactor also is negligible).\n\n10.2.1 Differential Operation\nThe mole balances for a steady-state PFR are initial-value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). As was the case with BSTRs in Chapter 9, it is possible to analyze PFR kinetics data using an approximate mole balance. This method, described below, is known as the differential method of analysis of PFR data. Unlike differential analysis of BSTR data, if one plans to use the differential method of analysis for PFR data, then an additional restriction is imposed during the experiments. This requirement is that the molar flow rate of each reagent present in the feed should not change by more than ca. 5% between the inlet and the outlet of the reactor."

    "text": "10.3 Design of PFR Experiments\nIt was noted in the preceding section that the operational procedure for generating kinetics data using a PFR is essentially the same as that for a CSTR. Both of these reactors are flow reactors, and consequently the adjusted inputs and experimental responses are the same. The space time determines the amount of time during which reaction can occur, and the space time is adjusted by varying individual reagent or total flow rates. In principle the reactor volume could also be varied to change space time, but doing so is impractical. The temperature is controlled directly making it easy to generate blocks of same-temperature kinetics data. In a PFR the composition changes continually as the reagents flow through the reactor. The composition and flow rate of the feed to the reactor can be varied so that the concentrations or partial pressures of the reagents each span their range of interest. As with BSTRs and CSTRs, the experimental response can be any quantity that is directly related to the composition of the fluid leaving the reactor or to the extent of reaction relative to the reactor feed."

    "section": "10.4 PFR Data Analysis",
    "text": "10.4 PFR Data Analysis\nReaction Engineering Basics only considers the generation and analysis of kinetics data for single reactions occurring in isothermal, isobaric, steady-state PFRs. Further, it assumes that the data are generated in blocks where all of the experiments in a given block are conducted at the same temperature. When this is true, each of the same-temperature data blocks is first analyzed separately to find the best values of the rate expression parameters at that temperature. Once all of the data blocks have been analyzed, a second analysis is performed to find the best values of the pre-exponential factors and activation energies/enthalpies for the rate coefficients and unknown equilibrium constants. The second analysis was illustrated in the examples in Chapter 9. It does not involve the reactor model, but instead the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, or the equivalent model for the equilibrium constant, Equation 4.12. As such, the second analysis is exactly the same no matter which of the ideal reactor types was used to generate the data. Since the analysis of the rate expression parameters obtained from the same-temperture data blocks has already been demonstrated in Chapter 9, the examples in this chapter focus upon the analysis of a single, same-terperature data block that was generated using a PFR. However, see the notes that follow Examples 10.5.2 and 10.5.3.\nOnly the PFR mole balance is necessary to analyze a single data block because when the reactor operates isobarically and isothermally at a known temperature, the mole balances can be solved independently of the energy and momentum balances for the reactor. The PFR mole balance was derived in Chapter 6, and the steady-state version is given in Equation 6.40. In Reaction Engineering Basics kinetics data analysis problems, there is only one reaction taking place, so there is only one rate term, making it unnecessary to index the reaction, Equation 10.4.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\tag{10.4}\\]\nThis reactor model is an IVODE, and in order to solve it, every quantity appearing in or substituted into it must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, \\(z\\), and the dependent variable, \\(\\dot{n}_i\\). When a rate expression is substituted into Equation 10.4, it generally will introduce either concentrations or partial pressures. Since this is a flow system, these quantities can be expressed in terms of the molar flow rate of reagent \\(i\\) using Equations 1.15, 11.2, and 11.3.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot{n}_iP}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_iP}{RT\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\]\nIf only one mole balance is being used in the analysis, the concentrations or partial pressures of reagents other than \\(i\\) can be related to the molar flow rate of \\(i\\) using the apparent extent of reaction as described in Chapter 3 and illustrated in Example 9.5.2.\nWhen the reactor temperature is known and only the mole balance design equations are being used to analyze the data, the cumulative reactor volume, \\(V\\), is sometimes used as the independent variable instead of the axial distance into the reactor, \\(z\\). When this is done, it is not necessary to know both the reactor diameter and length, only the reactor volume is needed. Changing the independent variable in the PFR mole balance, Equation 10.4, from \\(z\\) to \\(V\\) is straightforward. Dividing both sides of the equation by the reactor cross-sectional area and recognizing that the cross-sectional area time an increment in the axial position, \\(dz\\), is equal to an increment in the volume, \\(dV\\), leads to the desired form of the mole balance, Equation 10.5.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z} =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{\\displaystyle\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}d z} = \\nu_{i}r\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dV} = \\nu_{i}r\n\\tag{10.5}\\]\nPFRs are commonly used to generate kinetics data for heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Using the pseudo-homogeneous approximation described in Appendix G, the ideal PFR design equations can still be used to analyze the data. However, it is a very common practice to normalize heterogeneous catalytic reaction rates using the catalyst mass instead of the reacting fluid volume. If \\(\\rho_{\\text{bed}}\\) is the apparent packed bed density, that is the combined volume of the solid catalyst and the fluid per mass of catalyst, the mole balance takes the form shown in Equation 10.6 where the rate has units of mol time-1 (catalyst mass)-1. The mass of catalyst can also be used as the independent variable by simply dividing both sides of Equation 10.6 by the apparent bed density and the reactor cross-sectional area, Equation 10.7 where the rate again has units of mol time-1 (catalyst mass)-1.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}\\rho_{\\text{bed}} r\n\\tag{10.6}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dm}  =\\nu_{i} r\n\\tag{10.7}\\]\nFinally, if the reactor was operated differentially when generating the data, an approximate mole balance can be used, Equation 10.8. This is completely analogous to the approximate mole balance used for analysis of BSTR data. It converts the mole balance from an IVODE to an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE). The derivative can be approximated using backward, forward or central differences (see Appendix A). The approximation of the derivative as the ratio, \\(\\frac{\\Delta \\dot n_i}{\\Delta z}\\), is only valid when the changes in \\(\\dot n_i\\) and \\(z\\) are small. That is why it is necessary to operate the reactor differentially for this type of analysis.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\dot n_i}{\\Delta z}  =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\tag{10.8}\\]\n\n10.4.1 Analysis Using a Response Function\nThe analysis of PFR kinetics data using a response function is analogous to the analysis of BSTR kinetics data using a response function. A response function is created that is passed the adjusted experimental inputs and values for the rate expression parameters as arguments. Within the response function, the reactor model (the IVODE PFR mole balances) is solved for each experiment to find the outlet molar flow rates of all reagents. The results are then used to calculate the model-predicted value of the response. The response function returns the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments.\nThe response function is then used as an argument in parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses, and a guess for the parameters. The parameter estimation software returns the estimated values of the rate expression parameters, their 95% confidence intervals and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). The estimated parameters can then be used to calculate the model-predicted responses for the experiments. From these, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created. If the rate expression is accurate, the following criteria will be satisfied.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), will be close to 1.\nThe uncertainty in each parameter estimate will be small compared to the estimate (so the confidence interval is narrow relative to the parameter value).\nThe points in the parity plot will all be close to a diagonal line (\\(y_{\\text{expt}} = y_{\\text{model}}\\)).\nIn each residuals plot, the points will scatter randomly about zero (the horizontal axis), and no systematic deviations will be apparent.\n\n\n\n10.4.2 Analysis Using a Linearized Model\nWhen only one reaction is taking place, as is always the case in Reaction Engineering Basics kinetics data analysis problems, the reactor can be modeled using only one mole balance on a reactant or product in the reaction. When this is done, the apparent extent of reaction is used to relate the amounts of all other reagents to the reagent for which the mole balance is written. Sometimes the single mole balance can be solved analytically, for example by separation of variables. Doing so yields an integrated mole balance that is an ATE. If the integrated mole balance can be rearranged into a linear form, the model can be fit to the experimental data using linear least squares. This was described in in Chapter 8 and illustrated in Chapter 9 and won’t be repeated or illustrated in this chapter.\n\n\n10.4.3 Analysis Using an Approximate Reactor Model\nThis approach, commonly referred to a differential data analysis, is completely analogous to differential analysis of BSTR data. The one significant difference is that to use differential data analysis with PFR data, the reactor must have been operated differentially when the data were generated. The mole balance given in Equation 10.8 is used. As noted in Chapter 9, the approximate mole balance is often linearized and the analysis is performed using linear least squares. In most cases, differential analysis is less accurate than analysis using a response function or a linearized integrated mole balance. Since differential data analysis was illustrated in Chapter 9, it is not repeated in the examples of this chapter."

It should be mentally insert it at the start of every example this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking after Reading each Problem Statement in this Chapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment involves “kinetics data analysis.” I realize that because the problem statement includes 3 distinguishing characteristics of kinetics data analysis assignments.\n\nThe problem statement describes reactor experiments involving a known reaction.\nThe data resulting from performing those experiments are provided.\nThe assignment is to generate a rate expression or estimate the parameters in a proposed rate expression and then assess its accuracy using those data.\n\nI know that the preferred way of performing experiments results in sub-sets (or blocks) of the data that each contain a number of experiments all performed at the same temperature. I further know that when this is true, each same-temperature block is first analyzed separately to estimate values of the kinetics parameters at that block’s temperature.\nThus, to begin this assignment I need to do the following things.\n\nSeparate the experimental data into same temperature blocks.\nIdentify (a) the reactor inputs that were varied from experiment, (b) the reactor response that was measured in each experiment, and (c) the rate expression parameters that need to be estimated for each block.\nDevelop a mathematical model that relates the adjusted inputs to the measured response.\nEstimate the rate expressions parameters for each block and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression for that block.\n\n\n\n\nIt was noted earlier in this chapter that each of the examples here illustrate the analysis of a single constant-temperature data block. That analysis yields values of the rate expression parameters at that temperature. Typically, this would be repeated several times using data blocks at different temperatures. Then the results would be collected and used to estimate additional parameters associated with the temperature dependence of the rate expression parameters. Most commonly, the analysis of the individual data blocks yields values for a rate coefficient at each of the data block temperatures. They are collected and used to estimate the value of the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor and activation energy for that rate coefficient. The Arrhenius analysis, as well as alternative analysis of the data blocks using a linearized reactor model and/or an approximate reactor model are not presented here. For that see Examples 4.5.4, 9.5.1, and 9.5.2.\n\n10.5.1 Kinetics of Gas-Phase Decomposition\nThe gas-phase decomposition of reagent A, reaction (1), was studied 1 atm using a PFR with a diameter of 1.0 cm and a length of 10 cm. The inlet volumetric flow rates of reagents A, Y, and Z, in standard cm3 min-1, were varied from experiment to experiment. In all experiments the outlet conversion of reagent A was measured. The data for a block of experiments at a temperature of 1500 K are presented below.

It describes reactor experiments, provides the resulting data and asks me to assess a rate expression. Here I will solve it using a response function, so I need to identify the experimentally adjusted inputs and the measured response. At the same time, I can summarize the other information provided in the problem statement.\n\n\n\nReactor: PFR\nGiven: \\(P=1\\text{ atm}\\), \\(D=1\\text{ cm}\\), \\(L=10\\text{ cm}\\), and \\(T=1500\\text{ K}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{A\\text{(STP)},in}\\), \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Y\\text{(STP)},in}\\), and \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Z\\text{(STP)},in}\\).\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{f}_A\\).\nRate Expression Parameters: \\(k\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the response function is to solve the reactor design equations for each experiment and use the results to calculate the predicted value of the response. The reactor used here is a PFR. The reactor operated isothermally, and there is no mention of pressure drop, so I don’t need a momentum balance, and I can solve the mole balance design equations separately from the energy balances. The mole balance design equation for a steady-state, PFR with only one reaction taking place is given in Equation 10.4.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{d z} =\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\nu_{i}r\n\\]\nSince there are three reagents in this system, I need to write a mole balance for each of them. Noting that the stoichiometric coefficients are \\(\\nu_A = -1\\), \\(\\nu_Y = 1\\), and \\(\\nu_Z = 1\\) leads to equations (3) through (5). The design equations are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs) with the molar flow rates as the dependent variables and the axial position as the independent variable. I can define \\(z=0\\) to be the inlet to the reactor. The initial values needed to solve the IVODEs are the molar flow rates of A, Y, and Z at the inlet. I can use \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\), to represent those inlet molar flow rates. The reaction stops at the end of the reactor, so the stopping criterion is \\(z=L\\).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on A, Y, and Z are shown in equations (3), (4), and (5). The initial values and stopping criterion needed to solve them are given in Table 10.2\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_A}{dz} = -\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Y}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Z}{dz} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}r \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\nTable 10.2: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, (3), (4), (5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(L\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore I can solve the mole balance IVODEs, I need to go through the equations, initial values and stopping criterion, and any equations that will be substituted into them, and express every quantity that appears in them in terms of known constants, the independent variable (\\(z\\)) and the dependent variables (\\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)). Within the response function, the values of the adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameter will be know and constant, so I don’t need expressions for them. I can see that when the rate expression, equation (2), is substituted into the mole balances it will introduce the partial pressure of A, so I need an expression for that. I am given the inlet (standard) volumetric flow rates of the reagents, so I’ll need to calculate the molar flow rates at the inlet, since they are the initial values.\nFor the partial pressure of A, I can just use the defining equation, Equation 1.19. The volumetric flow rates given in the assignment are volumetric flows at standard temperature and pressure (STP). The molar volume of an ideal gas at STP, \\(\\hat{V}_\\text{ STP}\\), is a known constant, e. g. 22.4 L mol-1, and can be used to calculate the inlet molar flows from the given inlet volumetric flows. (Note that if, instead, the assignment had provided actual inlet volumetric flows, the ideal gas law would be used and not \\(\\hat{V}_\\text{ STP}\\).)\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nP_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A+\\dot{n}_Y + \\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_A\\Big\\vert_{z=0} = \\dot{n}_{A,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{A\\text{(STP)},in}}{\\hat{V}_{\\text{ STP}}} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Y\\Big\\vert_{z=0} = \\dot{n}_{Y,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{Y\\text{(STP)},in}}{\\hat{V}_{\\text{ STP}}} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Z\\Big\\vert_{z=0} = \\dot{n}_{Z,in} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{Z\\text{(STP)},in}}{\\hat{V}_{\\text{ STP}}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point within the response function, the mole balance design equations can be solved to find the values of the dependent variables, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), at the reactor outlet. Those results then must be used to calculate the predicted value of the response. In this study, the response was the fractional conversion of A, which can be calculated using the definition of fractional conversion, Equation 3.5.\n\n\n\nResponse Calculation\n\\[\nf_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_{A,in}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure:\n\nThe adjusted inputs, \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{A\\text{(STP)},in}\\), \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Y\\text{(STP)},in}\\), and \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}_{Z\\text{(STP)},in}\\), and the rate expression parameter, \\(k\\), are passed to it as arguments.\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities: \\(P=1\\text{ atm}\\), \\(D=1\\text{ cm}\\), \\(L=10\\text{ cm}\\), and \\(T=1500\\text{ K}\\).\nA function that evaluates the derivatives in the design equations given values of the independent variable, \\(z\\), and the dependent variables, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\), is defined.

In all experiments the same amount of catalyst, 3.0 g, was present in the reactor, forming a small packed bed. The apparent density of the catalyst bed was constant, and pressure drop across the catalyst bed was negligible. The inlet volumetric flow rate was also the same in all experiments and equal to 0.85 L min-1 at standard temperature and pressure. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, Y, and Z were varied in the experiments and the partial pressure of A at the reactor outlet was recorded. Use the data for a block of experiments at 400 °C presented below to assess the accuracy of the power-law rate expression shown in equation (2).

The response function solves the reactor design equations for the experimental reactor and uses the results to calculate a predicted value for each measured response. Thus, the first thing I need to do is to write the reactor design equations for the experimental reactor. Since the reactor is isobaric and isothermal, and its temperature is known, I can model it using only mole balances on the reagents A, B, Y, and Z. The reaction is catalytic and the size of the reactor is not provided. The mass of catalyst is provided, so I will use a form of the PFR mole balance where the catalyst mass is the independent variable, Equation 10.7, and the rate is normalized by the catalyst mass. The stoichiometric coefficients of A, B, Y, and Z are -1, -1, 1, and 1, respectively.\n\\[\n\\frac{d \\dot n_i}{dm} =\\nu_{i} r\n\\]\nThe design equations are IVODEs, so initial values and a stopping criterion are needed in order to solve them. At the inlet to the reactor, the catalyst mass is equal to zero, \\(m=0\\), and at the end of the reactor it is equal to \\(m_{\\text{cat}}\\). Letting \\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\), \\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\) represent the molar flow rates at the reactor inlet then leads to the initial values and stopping criterion shown in Table 10.5.\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on A, B, Y, and Z, are presented in equations (3) through (6), and the corresponding initial values and stopping criterion are shown in Table 10.5.\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_A}{dm} = -r \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_B}{dm} = -r \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Y}{dm} = r \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\dot{n}_Z}{dm} = r \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\nTable 10.5: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3) through (6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(m\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(m_{\\text{cat}}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_A\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{A,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_B\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{B,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Y\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Y,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\dot{n}_Z\\)\n\\(\\dot{n}_{Z,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the mole balances are IVODEs, I will need to express every quantity that appears in them or is substituted into them in terms of known constants, the independent variable, \\(m\\), and the dependent variables, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\) before I can solve them. When the rate expression is substituted into equations (3) through (6) it will introduce the partial pressures of each of the reagents. These can be related to the molar flow rates using Equation 1.19.\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot n_iRT}{\\dot V} = C_iRT\n\\]\nThe rate expression parameters and the adjusted inputs will be available in the response function, so no other expression need to be substituted into the design equations. However, the initial values are not known and must be calculated. Letting \\(\\hat{V}_{STP}\\) represent the standard molar volume of an ideal gas, 22.4 mol L-1, the inlet volumetric flow rate divided by the standard molar volume yields the molar flow rate. Multiplying that by the inlet mole fraction yields the needed inlet molar flow rates.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nP_A = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_B = \\frac{\\dot{n}_B}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_Y = \\frac{\\dot{n}_Y}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_Z = \\frac{\\dot{n}_Z}{\\dot{n}_A++\\dot{n}_B+\\dot{n}_Y+\\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_A\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{A,in} = y_{A,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_B\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{B,in} = y_{B,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Y\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{Y,in} = y_{Y,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_Z\\Big\\vert_{m=0} = \\dot{n}_{Z,in} = y_{Z,in}\\frac{\\dot{V}_{in}}{\\hat{V}_{STP}} \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the information just provided, the mole balances can be solved within the response function to find the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, Y, and Z.

This suggests an accurate rate expression. However, the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals for the parameters are significant compated to the parameter values. This suggests some inaccuracy in the model.\n\n\n\nBased upon the parity plot, residuals plots and coefficient of determination, the rate expression in equation (2) accurately predicts the experimental results when the parameters have the values shown in Table 10.6. The confidence intervals are not narrow relative to the parameters’ values, but they are acceptable. It is possible that additional experiments at different conditions would tighten the confidence intervals for the parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose similar blocks of experimental data had been generated at several other temperatures and that equation (2) had been found to be accurate at those temperatures. The next step would be to assess how well the rate expression captures the temperature dependence of the rate. For the rate coefficient, \\(k\\), this would be done by fitting the Arrhenius expression to the set of values of \\(k\\) from each of the data blocks.\nHowever, there isn’t any theoretical or empirical basis for assuming that \\(\\alpha_A\\), \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\) obey the Arrhenius expression. In fact, it isn’t known how these parameters might vary with temperature. This is a disadvantage of using an empirical power-law rate expression.\nIf the estimated value of \\(\\alpha_A\\) was effectively the same at every temperature and the same was true for \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\), then they could be taken to be constant and the accuracy of the rate expression could be assessed by fitting the Arrhenius expression to the \\(k\\) values. In other words, the only temperature-dependent kinetics parameter would be \\(k\\). If it was accurate, equation (2) would be useful as a rate expression.\nHowever, if the estimated values of \\(\\alpha_A\\), \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\) vary with temperature it would necessary to (a) find expressions that predict their variation with temperature and (b) assess the accuracy of those expressions.\nIf expressions for the temperature dependence of \\(\\alpha_A\\), \\(\\alpha_B\\), \\(\\alpha_Y\\), and \\(\\alpha_Z\\) could not be found, then in order to use the rate expression in equation (2) a table of their values vs. temperature would be necessary. Interpolation would need to be used for temperatures not in the table. In this scenario, equation (2) would not be very useful, even if it was very accurate in representing the individual data blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.3 Mechanistic Kinetics of a Heterogeneous Catalytic Reaction\nIn Example 10.5.2, kinetics data for reaction (1) that had been generated in a steady-state, isothermal PFR were used to assess the accuracy of a power-law rate expression. In those experiments the same amount of catalyst, 3.0 g, was present in the reactor, forming a small packed bed. The apparent density of the catalyst bed was constant, and pressure drop across the catalyst bed was negligible. The inlet volumetric flow rate was also the same in all experiments and equal to 0.85 L min-1 at standard temperature and pressure. The inlet mole fractions of A, B, Y, and Z were varied in the experiments and the partial pressure of A at the reactor outlet was recorded. Use the data for a block of experiments at 400 °C presented in that example to assess the accuracy of the mechanistic rate expression shown in equation (2). The equilibrium constant, \\(K_1\\), in equation (2) can be calculated from available thermodynamic data. At 400 °C the value of \\(K_1\\) is 12.2.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{kP_{A}P_{B}}{1 + K_AP_A + K_BP_B + K_YP_Y + K_ZP_Z }\\left( 1 - \\frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \\right) \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 10.7; the full data set are available in the file, reb_10_2_data.csv.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.7: First 8 of the 64 experimentally generated data.\n\n\nyA,in\nyB,in\nyY,in\nyZ,in\nPA,out (atm)\n\n\n\n\n0.3\n0.231\n0.155\n0.314\n0.266\n\n\n0.3\n0.231\n0.234\n0.234\n0.265\n\n\n0.3\n0.231\n0.310\n0.159\n0.278\n\n\n0.3\n0.350\n0.115\n0.234\n0.244\n\n\n0.3\n0.350\n0.175\n0.175\n0.252\n\n\n0.3\n0.350\n0.231\n0.119\n0.267\n\n\n0.3\n0.462\n0.079\n0.159\n0.227\n\n\n0.3\n0.462\n0.119\n0.119\n0.242\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only difference in this assignment from Example 10.5.2 is the rate expression to be assessed.

Therefore the rate will be the same if the parameters equal \\(k\\), \\(K_B\\), and \\(K_Y\\) or if they equal \\(\\alpha k\\), \\(\\alpha K_B\\), and \\(\\alpha K_Y\\). In other words, the remaining parameters are coupled. This problem can be eliminated by dividing the numerator and denominator by \\(K_Y\\) and defining two new kinetics parameters.\n\\[\nk^\\prime = \\frac{k}{K_Y}\n\\]\n\\[\nK_B^\\prime = \\frac{K_B}{K_Y}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{k^\\prime P_{A}P_{B}}{K_B^\\prime P _B + P_Y}\\left( 1 - \\frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nAssessment\nThe uncertainty in the kinetics parameters is unacceptable. Some of the parameters in equation (2) may be kinetically insignificant or coupled. It is recommended to repeat the analysis using the rate expression shown in equation (15).\n\\[\nr = \\frac{k^\\prime P_{A}P_{B}}{K_B^\\prime P _B + P_Y}\\left( 1 - \\frac{P_YP_Z}{K_1P_AP_B} \\right) \\tag{15}\n\\]\nFollow-up\nThe analysis was repeated a third time using equation (15) as the rate expression. The parameter estimation results are shown in Table 10.10. The parity plot is shown in Figure 10.6 and the residuals plots are shown in Figure 10.7.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.10: Parameter estimation results for equation (15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk’\n5.36 x 10-3 mol L-1 min-1 atm-1, 95% CI [3.97 x 10-3, 7.23 x 10-3]\n\n\nKB’\n1.65 , 95% CI [1.07, 2.56]\n\n\nR2\n0.995\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Parity Plot for Rate Expression (3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Residuals for Rate Expression (15).\n\n\nFinal Assessment\nBased upon the parity plot, residuals plots, and coefficient of determination, the rate expression in equation (15) is just as accurate as that in equation (2). In addition, for rate expression (15), there are fewer parameters and their confidence intervals are narrow relative to their values. The rate expression in equation (15) is preferred over the rate expression in equation (2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the rate expression in equation (2) had been found to be acceptable, that similar blocks of experimental data had been generated at several other temperatures and that equation (2) had been found to be accurate at those temperatures, too. The next step would be to assess how well the rate expression captures the temperature dependence of the rate. Unlike Example 10.5.2, all of the kinetics parameters in this rate expression would be expected to display Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, making it straightforward to assess the accuracy of the rate expression with respect to temperature. Mechanistic types of rate expressions have an advantage over power-law types of rate expressions in this regard. With mechanistic types of rate expressions one knows how all of the parameters should vary with temperature, while with power-law rate expressions one does not know how the power-law exponents should vary."

    "text": "11.1 Laboratory CSTRs\nThere are many similarities between BSTRs and CSTRs. The primary difference is that fluid continually flows in and out of a CSTR. Basically CSTRs are BSTRs with inlet and outlet flow streams. Other than the stopped flow reactor, the BSTRs described in Chapter 9 could be converted to CSTR simply by adding a flow in and a flow out. In the case of the recirculation loop reactor, Figure 9.2, the flow in and out should be small compared to the recirculation flow within the loop. As with the BSTR, one of the most important characteristics of a CSTR is that it is perfectly mixed. As discussed below, when a CSTR is used to generate kinetics data, it is preferable to operate the CSTR at steady state. Consequently, in addition to assessing the mixing before experiments begin, it is also important to verify steady-state operation while conducting the experiments.\n\n11.1.1 Testing the Ideality of a CSTR\nGiven the similarities between BSTRs and CSTRs, most of the discussion in Chapter 9 applies here, as well. Specifically, one of the most important requirements is that the reactor must be perfectly mixed. Smoke tests and the measurement of the reactor response as the agitation rate is increased again can be used to test for perfect mixing. In addition, a property known as the residence time distribution can be used to assess how well a reactor conforms to the assumptions of an ideal CSTR. Essentially, it provides a necessary, but not sufficient, criterion that the laboratory reactor must satisfy. The measurement and use of the residence time distribution will be presented in Chapter 23."

    "section": "11.2 CSTR Kinetics Experiments and Data",
    "text": "11.2 CSTR Kinetics Experiments and Data\nThe nature of kinetics experiments involving a CSTR and the data they generate is different in some respects from a BSTR. To prevent the generally strong temperature dependence of reaction rates from masking weaker composition and pressure effects, experiments should be performed in blocks where all of the experiments in a block are performed at the same temperature. The first two examples in Chapter 9 showed how each block of data can then be analyzed to estimate the rate coefficient at the temperature used in that block. Then, once all of the blocks have been analyzed, the Arrhenius expression can be fit to the resulting \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data to estimate the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy.\nWhen using a CSTR to generate kinetics data, it should operate at steady state. There are two good reasons for this. First, the temperature of the reacting fluid is likely to change during transient operation, and that prevents the use of same-temperature data blocks. Second, when the reactor operates at steady state, data analysis is greatly simplified. Specifically, the steady-state reactor design equations are algebraic-transcendental equations (ATEs) whereas the transient design equations are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). Additionally, when the reactor operates at steady state at a known temperature, the mole balance design equations can be solved independently of the energy balances, so only the mole balances are needed when analyzing steady-state CSTR kinetics data.\nIn a typical CSTR kinetics experiment, the rate of fluid flow into the reactor is set along with the composition of the feed fluid. The pressure and temperature are also adjusted to their desired values for that experiment. Once these inputs have been fixed, the flow rate and composition of the fluid leaving the reactor is monitored. Initially the outlet composition and flow rate may change over time. This indicates that the CSTR has not yet reached steady state. When the outlet flow rate and composition become constant, the CSTR has reached steady state, and the response is measured, and that concludes the experiment. This is very different from BSTR experiments where the response was measured several times during a single experiment. The reason, of course, is that the composition changes during a BSTR experiment wherease nothing changes during a steady-state CSTR experiment. Consequently, the generation of kinetics data using a CSTR typically involves many more experiments compared to when a BSTR is used."

    "section": "11.3 Design of CSTR Experiments",
    "text": "11.3 Design of CSTR Experiments\nIn isothermal BSTR experiments the initial composition and pressure of the reacting fluid and the elapsed time at which the response was measured were the inputs that were adjusted so that the experiments sampled a wide range of compositions. In a sense, the same is true of flow reactor experiments (both CSTR and PFR), but in flow reactors the space time, Equation 6.1, determines how long the reaction is allowed to proceed instead of the elapsed wall-clock time (see Chapter 6). This means that for flow reactors there are more reactor inputs that can be adjusted in order to vary the space time.\nAs noted in Chapter 9, preliminary studies typically define ranges of interest for temperature, pressure, and composition, and the purpose of kinetics experiments is to generate kinetics data that span those ranges. For each factor (e.g. the temperature, pressure, the concentration of reagent A, the concentration of reagent B, etc.) a set of values (also called levels) are chosen that span its range of interest. Increasing the number of levels improves the resolution of the effect of that factor upon the reaction rate. At the same time, increasing the number of levels increases the number of experiments that must be performed. Once the levels have been chosen for each factor, a factorial design like that described in Chapter 8 can be used to specify the experiments that will be performed.\n\n11.3.1 Adjusted Experimental Inputs\nTemperature is always an important factor, and as previously noted CSTR experiments are conducted in blocks where the steady-state temperature is the same for all experiments in each block. The pressure is constant in CSTR experiments, so if pressure is a factor of interest, the reactor pressure becomes one of the adjusted inputs.\nThe concentrations (or, for gases, partial pressures) within the reactor are the ones that need to span their range of interest, but unfortunately they cannot be adjusted directly. Instead, the composition and flow rate of the feed entering the reactor are adjusted. Depending upon the configuration of the feed system, the variables that can be adusted include the molar flow rates of the individual reagents or the volumetric flow rate of the feed and the concentrations of the reagents in that feed. Changing these quantities effectively changes the starting composition and the space time. (This assumes that the same reactor will be used in every experiment so the reactor volume cannot be adjusted to vary the space time.)\n\n\n11.3.2 Experimental Responses\nIt was noted in Chapter 9 that there are many different quantities that can be used as the experimental response. That discussion won’t be repeated here. The response should be a quantity that is directly related to the composition of the fluid leaving the reactor or to the extent of reaction relative to the reactor feed. In other words, after measuring the response and knowing the feed, it should be possible to calculate the concentration of every reagent in the product stream leaving the reactor."

    "section": "11.4 CSTR Data Analysis",
    "text": "11.4 CSTR Data Analysis\nThe focus of this section is the analysis of a block of experimental CSTR kinetics data where the steady-state reactor temperature was the same in every experiment. Once all blocks have been analyzed as described here, the Arrhenius expression can be fit to resulting rate coefficients for the block temperatures. The fitting of the Arrhenius expression has been discussed and illustrated several times in Chapter 4, Chapter 6, and Chapter 9, and should be familiar at this point. It won’t be repeated again here, but instead, analysis of a constant-temperture block of CSTR kinetics data using the CSTR reactor design equations is featured.\nChapter 6 explained that when a reactor operates at a constant, known temperature, the mole balances for the reactor can be solved independently of the other reactor design equations. Consequently the steady-state form of the ideal CSTR mole balance, Equation 6.30, is the only equation needed to model the reactor used to generate CSTR kinetics data. In Reaction Engineering Basics the kinetics data analysis problems are limited to systems where only one reaction is taking place. In that situation, it is not necessary to use an index to differentiate between multiple reactions, and the steady-state mole balance takes the form shown in Equation 11.1.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_i + \\nu_i r V\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nWhen a rate expression is substituted into Equation 11.1 it will introduce the concentration (or possibly for gases, partial pressure) of one or more reagents. In order to solve the mole balances for the outlet molar flow rates of the reagents, the concentration or partial pressure must be expressed in terms of the molar flow rates. Assuming liquids to be incompressible ideal mixtures, the volumetric flow rate is constant and the concentration is related to the molar flow rates as shown in Equation 1.15.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_i}{\\dot V}\n\\]\nCSTRs operate at constant pressure, and when used in kinetics experiments, the temperature is also constant. For gas phase systems, however, the volumetric flow rate in Equation 1.15 will change if the reaction causes a change in the total number of moles. Using the ideal gas law to express the volumetric flow rate in terms of the molar flow rates yields the preferred expression for the concentration of a gas phase reagent, \\(i\\), shown in Equation 11.2.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{\\dot n_iP}{RT\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\tag{11.2}\\]\nIf the rate expression for a gas-phase reaction uses partial pressures instead of concentrations, the partial pressure is related to the molar flow rates as shown in Equation 11.3.\n\\[\nP_i = y_iP = \\frac{\\dot{n}_iP}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i\\left( \\dot{n}_i \\right)}\n\\tag{11.3}\\]\n\n11.4.1 Analysis Using a Response Function\nThe analysis of CSTR kinetics data using a response function is analogous to the analysis of BSTR kinetics data using a response function. The only difference is that the reactor model is a set of ATEs that must be solved numerically instead of a set of IVODEs. Briefly, the procedure is a follows. A response function is created. It is passed the adjusted experimental inputs and values for the rate expression parameters as arguments. Within the response function, the reactor model (the ATEs) is solved for each experiment to find the outlet molar flow rates of all reagents. The results are then used to calculate the model-predicted value of the response that was measured in the experiments. The response function returns the model-predicted responses for all of the experiments.\nAs noted, the CSTR mole balance design equations are ATEs that will be solved numerically. See Appendix H for a brief overview of the numerical solution of ATEs. A guess for the unknowns is typically needed when solving ATEs numerically. For this reason, it is useful to also make the experimental responses available within the response function. They can be used to make guesses for the unknowns in the mole balances. While the rate expression parameters are being estimated, the response function is called from within the paremeter estimation software. That software may provide a mechanism for additionally passing the experimental responses to the response function as arguments. If it doesn’t, they could be read from a file within the response function. Just as the exact calling and return variables depend upon the parameter estimation software, so does the mechanism for making the experimental responses available within the response function.\nThe response function is then provided to parameter estimation software along with the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental responses, and a guess for the parameters. The parameter estimation software returns the estimated values of the kinetics parameters, some measure of the uncertainty in the estimates, and the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). The estimated parameters can then be used to calculate the model-predicted responses for the experiments. From these, a parity plot and residuals plots can be created as described in Chapter 8. If the rate expression is accurate, the following criteria will be satisfied.\n\nThe coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), will be close to 1.\nThe uncertainty in each parameter estimate will be small compared to the estimate.\nThe points in the parity plot will all be close to a diagonal line (\\(y_{\\text{expt}} = y_{\\text{model}}\\)).\nIn each residuals plot, the points will scatter randomly about zero (the horizontal axis), and no systematic deviations will be apparent.\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Analysis Using a Linearized Model\nWhen only one reaction is taking place, as is the case in Reaction Engineering Basics kinetics data analysis problems, the reactor can be modeled using only one mole balance on a reactant or product in the reaction. When this is done, the apparent extent of reaction is used to relate the amounts of all other reagents to the reagent for which the mole balance is written. If that one mole balance can be rearranged into a linear form, the model can be fit to the experimental data using linear least squares. This was described and illustrated in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 and won’t be repeated or illustrated in this chapter.\nOne point to note, however, is that with CSTR kinetics data, the mole balance is already an ATE. It isn’t necessary to integrate an IVODE before linearizing it. Indeed, for a simple rate expression with only one rate coefficient of the form shown in Equation 11.4, the mole balance, Equation 11.1, will already have the linear form shown in Equation 11.5 if \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are defined as shown in Equation 11.6 and Equation 11.7.\n\\[\nr = kf\\left(\\dot{n}_i,P\\right)\n\\tag{11.4}\\]\n\\[\ny=kx\n\\tag{11.5}\\]\n\\[\ny = \\dot{n}_i - \\dot{n}_{i,in}\n\\tag{11.6}\\]\n\\[\nx=\\nu_i V f\\left(\\dot{n}_i,P\\right)\n\\tag{11.7}\\]"

I further know that when this is true, each same-temperature block is first analyzed separately to estimate values of the kinetics parameters at that block’s temperature.\nThus, to begin this assignment I need to do the following things.\n\nSeparate the experimental data into same temperature blocks.\nIdentify (a) the reactor inputs that were varied from experiment, (b) the reactor response that was measured in each experiment, and (c) the rate expression parameters that need to be estimated for each block.\nDevelop a mathematical model that relates the adjusted inputs to the measured response.\nEstimate the rate expressions parameters for each block and assess the accuracy of the resulting rate expression for that block.\n\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that each of the examples in this chapter present only a single constant-temperature block of data and ask that those data be used to assess the accuracy of a rate expression with respect to the concentration dependence of a rate expression. This is intentional. Two of the four examples in Chapter 9 illustrated the second phase of the analysis where the Arrhenius expression was fit to the rate coefficients found by fitting the reactor model to the experimental data. By now, the reader should know how to fit the Arrhenius expression to \\(k\\) vs. \\(T\\) data. The examples here focus exclusively on fitting a CSTR reactor model to CSTR kinetics data with the assumption that the reader already knows how to process the resulting rate coefficients and estimate their pre-exponential factor and activation energy.\n\n11.5.1 Analysis of Data for Liquid-Phase Reaction\nThe liquid-phase reaction between reactants A and B, reaction (1), was studied in a 100 cm3 laboratory CSTR. The reactor operated at steady state, and kinetics data were generated in blocks where the temperature was the same in all of the experiments in any one block. In each block the volumetric flow rate and the inlet concentrations of each of the reagents were adjusted, and the outlet concentration of reagent Y was measured. The data from a block of experiments where the temperature was 35 °C are presented below.

It describes a CSTR and experiments performed using it, provides the data from the experiments and asks me to assess a rate expression proposed for the reaction taking place during the experiments. To solve it I will need to create a response function, and that function will be passed the adjusted inputs and rate expression parameter and return predicted values of the response. To begin, I’ll summarize the information provided in the problem statement, identifying those different groups of variables.\n\n\n\nReactor: CSTR\nGiven: \\(V=100 \\text{ cm}^3\\) and \\(T=\\left( 35 + 273.15 \\right) \\text{ K}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{\\dot{V}}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{A,in}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{B,in}\\), \\(\\underline{C}_{Y,in}\\), and \\(\\underline{C}_{Z,in}\\)\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{C}_{Y,out}\\)\nRate Expression Parameter: \\(k\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI know that in kinetics data analysis problems I need to create a response function, and within that function, I need to solve the reactor model equations. Since the steady-state temperature of the reacting fluid is known, I can model the reactor using only mole balances. There are four reagents, A, B, Y, and Z, so I’ll write the mole balance, Equation 11.1, for each of them.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_i + \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficients of A and B are -1 and the stoichiometric coefficients of Y and Z are +1, leading to equations (3) through (6).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on the four reagents are shown in equations (3) through (6).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A - rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{B,in} - \\dot{n}_B - rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Y,in} - \\dot{n}_Y + rV \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{Z,in} - \\dot{n}_Z + rV \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reactor design equations are ATEs. Within the response function I will need to solve them numerically for the four outlet molar flow rates, \\(\\dot{n}_A\\), \\(\\dot{n}_B\\), \\(\\dot{n}_Y\\), and \\(\\dot{n}_Z\\). In order to solve those ATEs, I need to go through them and express every quantity that is in them, or that gets substituted into them, in terms of known constants and those 4 unknowns.\nThe adjusted inputs and the rate expression parameter will be available within the response function. Looking at the design equations, the volume is a known constant. The inlet molar flow rates of each reagent also appear in the design equations, so I’ll need ancillary equations for calculating them from known constants and the four unknowns. When the rate expression is substituted into the design equations it will introduce the concentrations of A and B, so expressions for them will be needed, too.

There is some scatter apparent in the parity plot, and the coefficient of determination is 0.988. These factors suggest that the rate expression is reasonably accurate. The residuals plots for \\(\\dot{V}\\) and \\(C_Y\\) show random deviations of the residuals about zero, too. However, in the residuals plots for \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) the residuals at low concentration do not scatter equally about zero. The residuals for \\(C_Z\\) show a definite trend, decreasing steadily as \\(C_Z\\) increases. This suggests that the reaction rate may have some functional dependence on the concentration of Z that is not captured in the rate expression.\n\n\n\nAssessment\nThe rate expression is reasonably accurate, but there are indications that the rate expression may not fully capture the dependence of the rate on the concentration of reagent Z. Rate expressions that include a functional dependence on the concentration of Z should be postulated and assessed to determine whether they can represent the experimental results more accurately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the accuracy of the rate expression is reasonable, but the indication that the rate depends on the concentration of Z is a concern. In a real-world study, there would be blocks of data at other temperatures. If the same trends were observed for each data block, the recommendation to try different rate expressions that include functional dependence on Z would be supported. If none of the other temperature blocks showed these trends, it might be recommended that the rate expression was reasonably acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.5.2 Analysis of Data for a Gas-Phase Reaction with Change of Total Moles\nPreliminary experiments have indicated that gas-phase reaction (1) is irreversible and that the rate is not affected by the concentration of the product Z. To generate kinetics data, experiments were performed in blocks where the temperature of every experiment in the block was the same. An ideal CSTR operating at 3 atm was used for all experiments. The feed in every experiment contained only reagents A and B. The space time and the mole fraction of A were varied from experiment to experiment, and the outlet concentration of Z was measured. The block of experiments where the temperature was equal to 450 °C is presented below. Use those data to assess the accuracy of the rate expression shown in equation (2) where the power-law reaction orders, \\(\\alpha_A\\) and \\(\\alpha_B\\), must be estimated along with the rate coefficient, \\(k\\).\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = kP_A^{\\alpha_A} P_B^{\\alpha_B} \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe first few data points are shown in Table 11.3.

Knowing that I will be creating a response function, I’ll start by listing the reactor type, constants given in the problem statement, the adjusted experimental inputs, the experimental response, and the rate expression parameters I need to estimate.\n\n\n\nReactor: CSTR\nGiven: \\(P = 3 \\text{ atm}\\) and \\(T = 450 + 273.15 \\text{ K}\\).\nAdjusted Inputs: \\(\\underline{\\tau}\\) and \\(\\underline{y}_{A,in}\\).\nExperimental Response: \\(\\underline{C}_Z\\).\nRate Expression Parameters: \\(k\\), \\(\\alpha_A\\), and \\(\\alpha_B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to generate a response function that predicts the responses using the rate expression. To start, I need a model for the reactor. Referring back to Chapter 6, I know that when the reactor operates at a known temperature, the mole balances can be solved independently from the other design equations, so all I need here is a set of mole balances for this reactor. The mole balance design equation for a steady-state CSTR with only one reaction taking place is given in Equation 11.1.\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{i,in} - \\dot{n}_i + \\nu_i r V\n\\]\nThe stoichiometric coefficients of A, B, and Z are -1, -1 and 1, respectively. The problem also states that the feed contained only reagents A and B, so the inlet molar flow rate of reagent Z is equal to zero. Substitution of those values leads to equations (3) through (5).\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on A, B, and Z are shown in equations (3) through (5).\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{A,in} - \\dot{n}_A - rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\dot{n}_{B,in} - \\dot{n}_B - rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot{n}_{Z,in}} - \\dot{n}_Z + rV \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the response function I will need to numerically solve equations (3) through (5) for the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, and Z. To do that, I must provide equations for calculating every other quantity in the equations from those unknowns and known constants. So I’ll go through each of the mole balances, and any equations that will be substituted into them, and write equations for the quantities other than the unknowns and known constants.\nAt first, looking at the mole balances, it appears that I’m not given sufficient information, but upon careful reading of the problem statement I see that all of the quantities provided are intensive quantities. When that is true, I can choose the value for one extensive quantity and use it as the basis for my calculations. I’m going to choose a reactor volume of 1 L as the basis for my calculations.\nThe mole balance design equations also contain the inlet molar flow rates of A and B. The problem statement does not provide any flow rates, but having chosen a volume as a basis, I can use the definition of space time, Equation 6.1, (which is one of the adjusted inputs) to calculate the inlet volumetric flow rate. Then I can use the ideal gas law to calculate the total inlet molar flow rate and the inlet mole fractions of A and B to calculate their inlet molar flow rates.\nWhen I substitute the rate expression into the mole balances, that will introduce the partial pressures of A and B. Equations for the partial pressures can be written using the unknowns and the defining equation for partial pressure. The rate coefficient and the reaction orders will be passed to the response function as arguments, so I don’t need equations for them.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\n\\[\nV = 1 \\text{ L }\\left( \\text{Basis} \\right) \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{V}_{in} = V/\\tau \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{in,\\text{total}} = \\frac{P\\dot{V}_{in}}{RT} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{A,in} = y_{A,in}\\dot{n}_{in,\\text{total}} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{n}_{B,in} = \\left(1 - y_{A,in}\\right)\\dot{n}_{in,\\text{total}} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_A = y_A P = \\frac{\\dot{n}_A}{\\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_B + \\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nP_B = y_B P = \\frac{\\dot{n}_B}{\\dot{n}_A + \\dot{n}_B + \\dot{n}_Z}P \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point the mole balances can be solved numerically for the outlet molar flow rates of A, B, and Z.

    "section": "12.1 Isolated Ideal Reactor Analysis",
    "text": "12.1 Isolated Ideal Reactor Analysis\nReactors are typically one component of a larger chemical process. That process might include heat exchangers, other reactors, splitting and mixing of fluid streams, and many other types of equipment. Nonetheless, for analysis purposes it often is possible to draw an imaginary box around only the reactor, and treat it as an isolated system. If the reactor is a BSTR, SBSTR, CSTR or PFR, then the system consists of an isolated ideal reactor.\nChapter 6 defined groups of variables and parameters that appear in the model for a generic isolated reactor. They included reactor inputs, reactor outputs, reactor parameters, fluid properties and reaction properties. In the analysis of isolated ideal reactors, the fluid properties (heat capacities, densities, etc.) and reaction properties (rate expressions, heats of reaction, etc.) are known. Consequently, in isolated reactor modeling the quantities appearing in the reactor design equations can be grouped as reactor inputs, reactor outputs, and process parameters.\nRecall from Chapter 6, the reactor inputs consist of the initial molar amounts (or inlet molar flow rates) of every reagent in the system, the initial (or inlet) temperature of the reacting fluid, the inlet mass flow rate and inlet temperature of the heat exchange fluid (if there is one), and, for plug-flow reactors, the inlet pressure of the reacting fluid. The reactor outputs consist of the final molar amounts (or outlet molar flow rates) of every reagent in the system, the final (or outlet) temperature of the reacting fluid, the outlet temperature of the heat exchange fluid (if there is one), and, for plug-flow reactors, the outlet pressure of the reacting fluid. The rate at which the reactor does work on its surroundings is also a reactor output, but for the ideal reactors in chemical processing plants, it is almost always negligible. The process parameters include the reactor dimensions (volume, length, diameter, etc., as appropriate), the heat transfer area, the heat transfer coefficient, catalyst bed properties (if there is a catalyst bed), and the reaction time (for a closed system) or the space time (for an open system).\nThe reactor design equations establish a relationship between the reactor inputs, the reactor outputs, and the process parameters. In any isolated reactor modeling assignment, the reaction engineer is given values for some of the inputs, outputs and parameters and tasked with determining the values of the others. Completing the task virtually always entails solving the reactor design equations, but the manner in which they are solved depends upon the nature of the task."

    "section": "12.2 Common Reaction Engineering Tasks",
    "text": "12.2 Common Reaction Engineering Tasks\nTo simplify the following discussion of reaction engineering tasks, “reactor variables” will be used to refer to the combined reactor inputs, reactor outputs, and process parameters. Three common isolated reactor modeling tasks are reactor response tasks, reactor optimization tasks, and reactor design tasks. Reactor response tasks, as defined here, are the most straightforward of the three. In a reactor response assignment the reaction engineer is provided with a sufficient number of reactor variables to allow calculation of all other reactor variables by solving the reactor design equations. Then, knowing all of the inputs, outputs and parameters, any other reactor response of interest, for example the conversion or a selectivity, can be calculated. Generally there is a single, correct answer to a reactor response assignment.\nThere are two varieties of response tasks. In one, the assignment provides all of the reactor inputs and process parameters that are needed in order to solve the reactor design equations for the reactor outputs. In Reaction Engineering Basics this type of task will be called a simple response task. In the other type, the assignment specifies the value of one reactor output or other response and is missing a reactor input or parameter. This kind of task will be called a specified response task. When numerical methods are used to solve the reactor design equations, these two types of response task require slightly different computational approaches.\nSometimes it may appear to a student who is just learning reaction engineering that a reactor response assignment does not provide a sufficient number of reactor variables to allow the reactor design equations to be solved. This occurs when the assignment asks for a graph plotting two variables against each other. In this case, the reaction engineer may choose values for one of the variables that span the range of interest, solve the design equations to find the corresponding values of the other variable, and plot the resulting data.\nIn optimization tasks the number of reactor variables that are specified or known is not sufficient to allow the reaction engineer to solve the reactor design equations. In lieu of the missing reactor variables, the assignment specifies that the reaction engineer must adjust one or more reactor variables so that the value of another reactor variable, the target variable, is maximized or minimized. The assignment entails finding the optimum value of each adjusted reactor variable and the corresponding (minimized or maximized) value of the target variable.\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics almost all optimization tasks will specify only one reactor variable to be adjusted and one target variable to be minimized or maximized. A simple optimization assignment like this is almost the same as a response problem that asks for a graph. Again, the reaction engineer can choose values for the adjusted variable, solve the design equations to find the corresponding values of the target variable, and plot the resulting data. To complete the task in this case, the graph must be inspected to identify the value of the adjusted variable where the target variable was mazimized/minimized and the corresponding value of the target variable. Alternatively, instead of plotting the target variables as a function of the adjusted variable, the results can simply be tabulated and the table can be inspected to identify the value of the adjusted variable where the target variable was mazimized/minimized and the corresponding value of the target variable.\nOptimization tasks can be much more complicated than that, however. The assignment may specify multiple adjusted variables. There can also be constraints on the values of reactor variables (not just the ones being adjusted). Constraints are conditions that must be obeyed. An example of a constraint would be that the temperature of the heat exchange fluid cannot exceed some specified value. Constrained, multiple variable optimization assignments will not be considered in Reaction Engineering Basics, but they usually can be solved by creating a response function as described below and passing that response function to software that performs constrained optimization.\nReactor design tasks are the most complicated of the tasks considered here. A reactor design assignment does not provide sufficient information to solve the reactor design equations. The reaction engineer must choose values for the missing reactor variables. In more extreme cases, the assignment may provide little more than the reagents that are available and the products that are to be produced. The type of reactor to use and how to operate it may be among the choices the reaction engineer needs to make.\nDesign tasks almost always involve an optimization sub-task. The quantity that needs to be maximized is typically financial in nature. The goal is to maximize the rate of making profit subject to both technical and financial constraints. Design at this level is typically taught in chemical engineering courses on plant design, and the system being optimized is typically an entire process, not just an isolated reactor.\nThat level of design task is well beyond the scope of Reaction Engineering Basics. However, highly simplified design tasks are presented herein. In general there are reactor variables that are related to the finances of an overall process. For example, the cost of operating a process may scale with the temperature of that process, in which case minimizing the temperature minimizes the operating cost. Design tasks in Reaction Engineering Basics use reactor variables as the quantities to be optimized. In general, there is not a single correct solution to a reactor design assignment. Design tasks are inherently “open-ended,” and multiple solutions are possible and acceptable."

    "section": "12.3 Creating a Response Function for Modeling Isolated Ideal Reactors",
    "text": "12.3 Creating a Response Function for Modeling Isolated Ideal Reactors\nChapter 6 described how to generate, simplify and solve the reactor design equations for each of the four ideal reactor types. Chapter 7 then introduced computer functions that were called response functions. Response functions are useful when numerical methods are used to complete reaction engineering tasks. In chapters 8 through 10 response functions were used for kinetics data analysis. This section presents an overview of the use of response functions for the completion isolated reactor modeling assignments. The discussion here may seem a bit abstract, but it will be illustrated in every example in Chapters 13 through 18.\nFigure 7.1, the schematic representation of a response function from Chapter 7, indicated three kinds of arguments that can be passed to response functions. Those argument types are called adjusted values, missing values and solver guesses. Solver guesses are used only when modeling a steady-state CSTR. The design equations for a steady-state CSTR are algebraic-transcendental equations (ATEs), and solving them typically requires providing a guess for their solution. The design equations for all the other reactor types considered in Reaction Engineering Basics are sets of initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs) and do not require solver guesses.\nAn adjusted value argument is used when performing a response task that requires making a graph and for optimization tasks. The adjusted values are typically the values that are plotted on the graph’s abscissa (\\(x\\)-axis). Depending upon the specifics of the problem, the adjusted values may be passed to the response function all at once (as a vector), or the response function may be called many times, passing one of the adjusted values each time it is called. If the adjusted value is a reactor input or a process parameter, then that quantity is not considered a missing value.\nA missing value argument is passed to the response function only when performing a specified response task. Recall, in a specified response task, the value of one reactor output (or related response) is specified in the assignment and the task is to find the value of the missing reactor input or process parameter that lead to that specified response. Within the response function, that missing value is needed in order to solve the reactor design equations, and that is why it is passed to the response function. Then, within the response function the design equations are solved and the results are used to calculate the specified response (and any other responses of interest).\nThe one exception to this occurs when the missing input is the reaction time (for a BSTR or SBSTR) or the reactor lenght (for a steady-state PFR). In those cases, the specified response can be used as the stopping criterion for solving the reactor design equations, and doing so will yield the missing value. (See Chapters 13, 14 and 17.)\nAt first it may seem odd to calculate and return the value of the specified response since its value is known. The reason for this is that doing so allows the response function to be used to calculate the missing reactor input. The response function can be thought of as a mathematical function that gives the value of the specified response as a function of the missing input. This is shown in Equation 12.1, where \\(\\Omega\\) is used to represent the response function, \\(x\\) represents the missing reactor input or process parameter, and \\(y\\) represents the reactor output variable whose value is specified in the assignment.\n\\[\n\\Omega\\left(x\\right) = y\n\\tag{12.1}\\]\nIf \\(y\\) in Equation 12.1 is set equal to the value specified in the assignment, \\(y_{spec}\\), the resulting equation is an ATE that can be solved to find the corresponding value of the missing reactor input or process parameter. To do so numerically, the ATE is re-written in the form of a residual equation, Equation 12.2. The response function can be used to create a function that evaluates the residual, and that function can be passed to an ATE solver along with a guess for the missing input, \\(x_{miss}\\).\n\\[\n\\Omega\\left(x\\right) = y \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad 0 = \\Omega\\left(x\\right) - y_{spec}\n\\tag{12.2}\\]\nAfter finding value of the missing input, \\(x_{miss}\\), the response function can then be passed that value to find the values of the other responses of interest.\nAgain, this description may seem abstract at this point, but it should become more concrete upon reading the examples in the chapters that follow this one."

    "section": "13.1 BSTR Operation",
    "text": "13.1 BSTR Operation\nBy definition, reaction does not take place continuously in a batch reactor. Before reaction can take place, the reactor must first be cleaned (or, in some cases, sterilized) to remove anything “left behind” by the last reaction that was run. Then the reactants must be prepared and charged into the reactor. From this point on, the operation is much like a cooking recipe. A prescribed series of steps is followed, with reaction taking place during every step. A simple example might be that after the reactants are charged, the reactor is heated to a specified temperature, held at that temperature for a specified length of time, and then cooled back to room temperature. In almost all situations, the reaction has ceased by the end of the last step, either because one of the reactants has been fully consumed or because the temperature has been lowered to the point where the rate is effectively zero. Of course, the operational protocol, i. e. the “recipe,” could be more complicated, requiring any number of steps.\nOnce the protocol has been followed to the end, the final operational step is to drain the reactor, sending the products on to the next stage of processing (this could be another reaction, purification, storage, etc.). It is very important to recognize that the productivity of the reactor, that is the amount of product it produces per hour, must be calculated taking the so-called turnaround time into account. That is, one must include the time needed to clean, fill and drain the reactor, not just the length of time reaction takes place. Doing so permits the definition of the net rate of generation of reagent \\(i\\) given in Equation 13.1.\n\\[\nr_{i,net} = \\frac{n_i - n_{i,0}}{t_{rxn} + t_{turn}}\n\\tag{13.1}\\]\nEven if the turnaround time was zero, it would still be desirable to define a net rate as above. The net rate is useful for characterizing the overall process. As the reaction is progressing, the rate of reaction is continually changing because the temperature and composition are changing. The rate of reaction at any one time during the processing is referred to as the instantaneous rate at that time, and the net rate accounts for the variation in the instantaneous rate. Similarly, it is sometimes useful to differentiate between overall and instantaneous values of other quantities such as yields, conversions, selectivities, etc."

    "section": "13.2 Qualitative Analysis of Reaction in a BSTR",
    "text": "13.2 Qualitative Analysis of Reaction in a BSTR\nIn general, when a chemical reaction takes place within a reactor, the composition, temperature and pressure will vary spatially and temporally, but since a BSTR is perfectly mixed, all that needs to be considered in a qualitative analysis is how quantities vary over time. For a “typical” chemical reaction\n\nthe rate will increase if the temperature of the reacting system is increased,\nthe rate will decrease if the concentration of one or more reactants decreases,\nthe rate is not strongly affected by the concentration of the products if the reaction is irreversible,\nthe rate decreases as the concentration of the products increases if the reaction is reversible,\nthe equilibrium constant decreases as the temperature increases if the reaction is exothermic, and\nthe equilibrium constant increases as the temperature increases if the reaction is endothermic.\n\nOf course, not all reactions behave “typically.” The approach to qualitative analysis presented here also can be applied to atypical reactions if the general behavior above is appropriately adjusted. For example for an autocatalytic reaction, the rate will increase as the concentration of at least one product increases.\nThe driving force for a chemical reaction is reducing the free energy of the system. Put differently, a chemical reaction always proceeds toward chemical reaction equilibrium. As a consequence, a single chemical reaction will never change direction spontaneously. To do so, the reaction would have to go beyond equilibrium and then turn around and go back. Since the reaction will never change directions, the concentrations of the reactants will continually decrease over time and the concentrations of the products will continually increase over time until equilibrium is reached. As equilibrium is reached, the concentrations will stop changing over time.\nThe temperature within the reactor is affected by two factors. The first is the occurrence of the chemical reaction and the other is the transfer of heat to or from an external exchange fluid. As reaction takes place, heat is either released (if the reaction is exothermic) or consumed (if the reaction is endothermic). Since the direction of the reaction does not change, heat will either be continually released or continually consumed over time until equilibrium is reached. If heat is released by the reaction faster than it is removed by transfer to the exchange fluid, the “excess” will be converted to sensible heat and the temperature of the reacting fluid will increase. Similarly, if heat is consumed by reaction faster than it is supplied by transfer from the exchange fluid, the temperature of the reacting fluid will decrease.\nThe amount of heat released or consumed by the reaction will vary over the processing time because the rate of the reaction will be varying. Additionally, since the temperature of the fluid within the reactor may vary over time, the rate of heat transfer may vary over the processing time. As a result, it is possible that for the first part of the processing time (while the rate is greater) the fluid temperature might be increasing because the reaction is releasing heat faster than the heat transfer surfaces can remove it. For the second part of the processing time (when the rate has become smaller) the fluid temperature might be decreasing because the heat transfer surfaces are removing it faster than the reaction is generating it.\nWhen the heat transfer rate exactly matches the heat of reaction over the entire course of the reaction, the reactor operates isothermally. Conversely, when the reactor operates isothermally, the temperature does not change over time. Alternatively, if the reactor is perfectly insulated so that there is no heat transfer, the reactor operates adiabatically. When the reactor operates adiabatically and the reaction is exothermic, the temperature will increase steadily over time until equilibrium is reached. When the reactor operates adiabatically and the reaction is endothermic, the temperature will decrease steadily over time until equilibrium is reached. When equilibrium is reached in an adiabatic reactor, the temperature will stop changing over time.\nIn order to perform a qualitative analysis of a single reaction taking place in a batch reactor, a reaction engineer must know how the reactor is being operated (isothermal, adiabatic, or neither). The discussion that follows concentrates on isothermal operation and adiabatic operation for which there are three possibilities:\n\nIsothermal operation – the concentrations of the reactants decrease steadily over time until equilibrium is reached, the concentrations of the products increase steadily over time until equilibrium is reached, and the temperature does not change over time.\nAdiabatic operation involving an exothermic reaction – the concentrations of the reactants decrease steadily over time until equilibrium is reached, the concentrations of the products increase steadily over time until equilibrium is reached, and the temperature increases steadily over time until equilibrium is reached.\nAdiabatic operation involving an endothermic reaction – the concentrations of the reactants decrease steadily over time until equilibrium is reached, the concentrations of the products increase steadily over time until equilibrium is reached, and the temperature decreases steadily over time until equilibrium is reached.\n\nIn many cases, the shape of plots of concentration, temperature, rate, selectivity, etc. over time can be determined qualitatively. The general procedure for doing so is as follows.\n\nDetermine the operating procedure (e. g. isothermal or adiabatic).\nDetermine whether the reaction is typical or atypical.\nDraw sets of axes for each plot with the quantity of interest on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.\nPlot a point on each y-axis representing the initial values of the quantities of interest.\nDetermine the initial slope of each graph by considering how the concentrations and temperature will change during a short interval of time and how those changes will affect other quantities of interest, such as the rate.\nDetermine the initial curvature of each graph by considering whether the changes in the next short interval of time will be greater than, equal to, or less than those in the first interval of time.\nDetermine whether the initial curvature eventually will result in the system approaching equilibrium (i. e. will the graph asymptotically approach a horizontal line?).\nIf the initial curvature will not lead to equilibrium, infer what must happen so that the system will go to equilibrium (i. e. will there be an inflection point or a minimum/maximum?), and qualitatively explain what will cause these changes in the curvature.\n\nQualitative analyses of this type are included in Example 13.6.1 and Example 13.6.4. They can be very useful during the initial stages of a reactor design assignment when a reaction engineer is deciding what type of reactor to use, as will be discussed in Chapter 18."

When an ideal, incompressible liquid is being processed, the pressure, \\(P\\), is constant and its time derivative, \\(\\frac{dP}{dt}\\), is equal to zero. Finally, for liquids, Equation 6.10 showed how the sensible heat term in Equation 6.9 can be expressed in terms of the mass-specific or volume-specific heat capacity of the solution as a whole instead of the individual molar heat capacities.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ \\rho V \\tilde C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\ V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\nWhen rate expressions are substituted into the BSTR mole and energy balances, they typically introduce concentrations or partial pressures of reagents. Those concentrations and partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the molar amounts of the reagents when the design equations are solved. The concentration is simply the molar amount divided by the volume, Equation 1.7.\n\\[\nC_i = \\frac{n_i}{V}\n\\]\nFor ideal gases, the partial pressure is related to the molar amount through the ideal gas law, Equation 1.12.\n\\[\nP_i = \\frac{n_iRT}{V}\n\\]"

    "text": "13.4 General Approach to Modeling Isolated BSTRs\nChapter 12 described how to identify an assignment that involves the modeling of an isolated ideal reactor and presented a general approach for doing so using a response function. This section describes the application of that approach to the modeling of an isolated BSTR. The first step is to write the reactor design equations for the system as described in Chapter 6 and in the preceding section of this chapter.\nThe design equations for an isolated BSTR will be a set of initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs). As can be seen in the equations above, the independent variable will be the elapsed time since the start of processing. The dependent variables in those equations are the molar amounts of the reagents present in the system, the temperature of the reacting fluid, and either the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid (when it exchanges sensible heat), or the fraction of the exchange fluid that undergoes phase change (when it exchanges latent heat).\nThe BSTR design equations always will be solved numerically to find the values of the dependent variables at one or more times after the start of processing. If any other quantity that appears in the design equations is missing, it will be provided at the point where the IVODEs are solved. Therefore, the second step in the general approach is to formulate the solution of the BSTR design IVODEs, assuming any missing value will be available.\nTo solve the reactor design IVODEs numerically, every quantity appearing in them, or substituted into them, must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, and the dependent variables. Also the initial values and the quantity used as a stopping criterion must be calculated if their values are not given. Thus, the third step in the general approach is to provide the ancillary equations needed to do these things.\nAfter solving the BSTR design IVODEs to find the values of the dependent variables, any other responses of interest in the assignment must be calculated. If the assignment specifies the value of a reactor output or response, its value still must be calculated at this point. Thus, the fourth step is to identify the ancillary equations needed to do so.\nThe next step in the general approach is to write a response function for the BSTR. If the formulation of the solution of the IVODEs assumed a missing value would be available, that missing values should be passed to the response function as an argument. However, if the missing value is the reaction time, it should not be passed to the response function as an argument. Within the response function the IVODEs should be solved numerically and any additional responses should be calculated as just described. The calculated responses should be returned by the response function.\nThe final step in the general approach to modeling an isolated BSTR is to use the response function to calculate all quantities of interest. The way this is done depends upon the nature of the modeling task as defined in Chapter 12.\n\n13.4.1 Using the Response Function to Complete the Assignment\nFor a simple response task there are no missing values. The response function can be called directly, and it will return the responses of interest. If the task involves generating a graph, the response function will have an adjusted value argument. A range of values of the adjusted variables that spans the range of interest for the graph should be selected. The response function can then be called with each of these values as the adjusted value argument, and it will return the corresponding values of the responses of interest. The response of interest can then be plotted as a function of the adjusted variable. Example 13.6.1 illustrates completion of a simple response task that requests a graph.\nGenerally in a specified-response task there will be one missing value, and the assignment will specify the value of one reactor output or response. However, if the missing value is the reaction time, then it will not be passed to the response function as an argument. In this case, the response function can be called directly and it will return the missing value, if needed, along with any other responses of interest. This is possible because when the reaction time is missing, the specified response can be used as the stopping criterion for solving the IVODEs, and the missing reaction time will be found upon solving the IVODEs. This is illustrated in Example 13.6.4.\nIf the missing value is any reactor input or process parameter other than the reaction time, it will be passed to the response function and the response function will return the value of the response specified in the assignment along with the other responses of interest. In this situation, as described in Chapter 12, the response function is first used to create a function that evaluates the residual equation, Equation 12.2, reproduced here.\n\\[\n\\Omega\\left(x\\right) = y \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad 0 = \\Omega\\left(x\\right) - y_{spec}\n\\]\nIn this equation \\(y_{spec}\\) is the specified response and \\(\\Omega\\) is the response function. The function that evaluates this residual equation is passed to an algebraic-transcendental equations solver (along with a guess for the missing value) which solves it to find the missing value. Then, if there are other responses of interest, the response function is called directly with the missing value as an argument to calculate those responses of interest. This is illustrated in Example 13.6.1.\nAn optimization task that involves only one adjusted variable can be thought of as response task that is repeated multiple times. Each time, that quantity is adjusted and the response to be optimized is calculated. The resulting responses are then plotted as a function of the adjusted quantity or tabulated with it. The resulting graph or table is used to identify the maximum or minimum value of the response to be optimized and the value of the adjusted quantity that leads to that minimum or maximum value. Examples 13.6.3 and 13.6.4 illustrate this type of task."

These types of design problems are beyond the scope of Reaction Engineering Basics. However, for illustrative purposes, reactor and process parameters can be used as indicators of these costs. For an isolated BSTR a few of the reactor and process parameters that might be used as economic indicators include the system volume (smaller is better), the processing time (shorter is better), the net production rate, Equation 13.1, (larger is better), heat requirements (smaller is better), and selectivity or yield of one of the products.

    "text": "13.6 Examples\nThe examples in this section illustrate the analysis of isolated BSTRs. Examples 13.6.1 and 13.6.2 are response problems. Specifically Example 13.6.1 involves a simple response task, while Example 13.6.2 involves a specified-response task. The numerical approaches used to solve these two types of problems are slightly different. In addition to the computational differences, Example 13.6.1 involves a single reaction taking place in an adiabatic BSTR while Example 13.6.2 features two reactions taking place in a reactor that is cooled using an exchange fluid. BSTRs. Examples 13.6.3 and 13.6.4 are optimization problems. They identify a reactor variable that must be maximized or minimized by specifying a reactor input. The computational procedure for solving optimization problems differs slightly from the procedures for solving response problems. Like Examples 13.6.1 and 13.6.2, the BSTR operating protocol in Example 13.6.3 consists of a single step. Example 13.6.4 illustrates a situation where there are multiple steps in the operating protocol. It also considers turnaround time and the net rate of reaction.\n\n13.6.1 Adiabatic Reaction with an Unknown Response\nThe liquid-phase reaction between A and B, equation (1), is irreversible. At the conditions of this problem, the heat of reaction is constant and equal to -101.2 kJ mol-1. The rate expression is given in equation (2), where the rate coefficient exhibits Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 5.11 x 104 L mol-1 s-1 and an activation energy of 74.8 kJ mol-1.\nTwo solutions, one containing only reagent A at 180 °C and one containing only reagent B at 180 °C, are charged to an adiabatic BSTR producing 1900 L of solution initially containing 2.9 mol A L-1 and 3.2 mol B L-1 at 180 °C. The solution is ideal and has a constant heat capacity of 1.23 cal g-1 K-1 and a constant density of 1.02 g cm-3. Plot the concentrations of A, B, Y, and Z, the reacting fluid temperature, and the instantaneous reaction rate for the first 2 h of reaction, and comment upon the shapes of the graphs.\n\\[\nA + B \\rightarrow Y + Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr = kC_AC_B \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThis assignment describes a single BSTR and its operation. There are no other reactors, heat exchangers, stream splits or stream mixers. The reaction taking place in the reactor is identified, and a rate expression is provided for it. The quantities of interest in the assignment are reactor variables. I know from Chapter 12 that this combination of characteristics identifies this as an isolated reactor modeling assignment.\nI know the general approach to completing an isolated reactor modeling assignment that was described in Chapter 12, and I will implement it here, but first I will summarize the information provided in the assignment.\n\n\n\nReactor: BSTR\nGiven: \\(\\Delta H_1 = -101.2 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\), \\(k_{0,1} = 5.11 \\times 10^4 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1}\\), \\(E_1 = 74.8 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\), \\(V = 1900 \\text{ L}\\), \\(T_0 = \\left( 180 + 273.15 \\right) \\text{ K}\\), \\(C_{A,0} = 2.9 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}\\), \\(C_{B,0} = 3.2 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}\\), \\(\\tilde{C}_p = 1.23 \\text{ cal g}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}\\), \\(\\rho = 1.02 \\text{ g cm}^{-3}\\), and \\(t_{\\text{rxn}} = 2 \\text{ h}\\).\nQuantities of Interest: \\(C_A\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_B\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_Y\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(C_Z\\left(t\\right)\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(r\\left(t\\right)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in the general approach to completing an isolated reactor modeling assignment is to write and simplify the design equations. As described in Chapter 6, mole balances are always included among the design equations. Here I will write a mole balance for each of the four reagents using Equation 6.8. There is only one reaction taking place, so the subscript, \\(j\\), is not needed. The stoichiometric coefficients of A and B are each equal to -1, and the stoichiometric coefficients of Y and Z are each equal to +1.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nThe BSTR in this assignment is not isothermal, so an energy balance must also be included among the design equations. The BSTR energy balance is given in Equation 6.9.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - \\cancelto{0}{V\\frac{dP}{dt}}  - \\cancelto{0}{P\\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\cancelto{0}{\\dot Q} - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\]\nA liquid-phase reaction is taking place in the BSTR. Assuming it to be an incompressible ideal solution, both the volume and the pressure are constant and their time derivatives are equal to zero. The reactor is adiabatic, so the rate of heat input, \\(\\dot{Q}\\), is equal to zero. There are no shafts or moving boundaries other than the agitator, and the rate at which it performs work is negligible, so \\(\\dot{W}\\) is also equal to zero. With only one reaction taking place, the summation over the reactions, \\(j\\), reduces to a single term. Finally, this assignment provides the mass-specific heat capacity of the entire solution, so the sensible heat term can be re-written using that heat capacity, Equation 6.10.\n\\[\nV \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right) \\Rightarrow rV \\Delta H\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} \\Rightarrow \\rho V \\tilde{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\nThe BSTR here operates adiabatically, so there isn’t an exchange fluid for which to write an energy balance, and momentum balances are not used with BSTRs, so that completes the reactor design equations needed to model the BSTR in this assignment.\nThe reactor design equations are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs), so initial values and a stopping criterion are needed in order to solve them. The instant the fluids are mixed in the reactor can be defined as \\(t=0\\), and \\(n_{A,0}\\), \\(n_{B,0}\\), \\(n_{Y,0}\\), \\(n_{Z,0}\\), and \\(T_0\\) can be used to represent the molar amounts of the reagents and the temperature at that instant. The assignment asks for reagent concentrations and temperature over the first 2 h of operation, so \\(t_{\\text{rxn}} = 2 \\text{ h}\\) represents the stopping criterion.\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balance design equations for A, B, Y, and Z are presented in equations (3) through (6), and the energy balance on the reacting fluid is given by equation (7). The initial values and stopping criterion for solving these initial value ordinary differential equations are listed in Table 13.1.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = -rV \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_B}{dt} = -rV \\tag{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Y}{dt} = rV \\tag{5}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_Z}{dt} = rV \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{-r \\Delta H_1}{\\rho \\tilde{C}_p} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\n\nTable 13.1: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, equations (3) through (7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{rxn}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(n_{B,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Y\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step in the general approach to completing an isolated reactor modeling assignment is to formulate the solution of the design equation to find the reactor outputs, assuming that any missing reactor inputs and process parameters will be available. Here the reactor design equations are IVODEs. In order to solve a set of IVODEs, it is necessary to to go through the equations, and any equations that will be substituted into them, and express every quantity they contain in terms of known constants, the independent variable and the dependent variables. Here the independent variable is \\(t\\), and the dependent variables are \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\). It is also necessary to calculate the initial values and the value to be used as the stopping criterion if they are not known.\nThe only quantity appearing in the design equations, (3) through (7), that isn’t a known constant, \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), or \\(T\\) is the rate, \\(r\\). Equation (2) can be used to eliminate \\(r\\) from the design equations, but that introduces \\(k\\), \\(C_A\\), and \\(C_B\\). The rate coefficient can be expressed in terms of \\(T\\) and known constants using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8. The concentrations of A and B can be expressed in terms of \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), and known constants using the defining equation for concentration. The initial moles of A, B, Y, and Z can similarly be found using the defining equation for concentration, noting that only A and B are present initially.\nHaving gone through the equations I can see that there aren’t any missing values, and the design equations can be solved directly to calculate the reactor outputs.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\nUpon substitution of equations (8) through (10) into the design equations, they will only contain known constants, the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\). As such, they can be solved numerically. The initial molar amounts of of the reagents can be calculated using equations (11) through (14) and used to solve the design equations.\n\\[\nk = k_{0,1}\\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{9}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_B = \\frac{n_B}{V} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = C_{A,0}V \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{B,0} = C_{B,0}V \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{Y,0} = 0 \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{Z,0} = 0 \\tag{14}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step in the general approach to completing an isolated reactor modeling assignment is to write the ancillary equations needed to calculate the response(s) of interest and any specified response once the design equations have been solved.\nSolving the design equations will give values of \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\) at times between \\(t=0\\) and \\(t = t_{\\text{rxn}}\\). The responses of interest are the concentrations, temperature, and rate vs. \\(t\\). The concentrations can again be calculated using the defining equation for concentration, and the rate can be calculated using equation (2). No responses are specified in this assignment, so no other response needs to be calculated.\n\n\n\nResponse Calculation\nSolving equations (3) through (7) will yield \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\) as functions of \\(t\\). The concentrations of A, B, Y, and Z as functions of time can be computed using equations (9), (10), (15), and (16).

In this assignment, there were no missing values that need to be passed to the response function. It simply needs to solve the design equations and compute the responses of interest as described above.\n\n\n\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure:\n\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities: \\(\\Delta H_1 = -101.2 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\), \\(k_{0,1} = 5.11 \\times 10^4 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1}\\), \\(E_1 = 74.8 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}\\), \\(V = 1900 \\text{ L}\\), \\(T_0 = \\left( 180 + 273.15 \\right) \\text{ K}\\), \\(C_{A,0} = 2.9 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}\\), \\(C_{B,0} = 3.2 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}\\), \\(\\tilde{C}_p = 1.23 \\text{ cal g}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}\\), \\(\\rho = 1.02 \\text{ g cm}^{-3}\\), and \\(t_{\\text{rxn}} = 2 \\text{ h}\\).\nA function that evaluates the derivatives in the design equations given values of the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\), is defined. It\n\nCalculates \\(k\\) using equation (8).\nCalculates \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) using equations (9) and (10).\nCalculates \\(r\\) using equation (2).\nEvaluates and returns the values of the derivatives, equations (3) through (7).\n\nThe response function then\n\nCalculates \\(n_{A,0}\\), \\(n_{B,0}\\), \\(n_{Y,0}\\), \\(n_{Z,0}\\) using equations (11) through (14).\nSolves the design equations using the initial values and stopping criterion in Table 13.1 to find \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), and \\(T\\) at values of \\(t\\) between 0 and \\(t_{\\text{rxn}}\\).\nCalculates \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), \\(C_Y\\), and \\(C_Z\\) at those times using equations (9), (10), (15), and (16).\nCalculates \\(r\\) at those times by first calculating \\(k\\) using equation (8), and then calculation \\(r\\) using equation (2).\nReturns the times between 0 and \\(t_{\\text{rxn}}\\), the concentrations, \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), \\(C_Y\\), and \\(C_Z\\), at those times, the temperature, \\(T\\), at those times, and the rate, \\(r\\), at those times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final step in the general approach to completing an isolated reactor modeling assignment is to use the response function to calculate the responses/unknowns of interest. In this assignment, this is accomplished simply by executing the response function to get the values of the responses of interest as functions of reaction time and then plotting the results.\n\n\n\nCalculations\nA computer script/function was written to perform the calculations as described above. Specifically, it\n\nCall the response function to get sets of values of \\(t\\), \\(C_A\\), \\(C_B\\), \\(C_Y\\), \\(C_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(r\\) at times between \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=t_{rxn}\\).\nPlots each of the concentrations, the temperature, and the rate versus time.\n\nResults\nPerforming the calculations as described yields the concentration profiles shown in Figure 13.1, the temperature profile shown in Figure 13.2, and the rate profile shown in Figure 13.3\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Concentrations versus reaction time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Temperature versus reaction time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Rate versus reaction time.\n\n\nSummary and Comments\nThe variation in the concentrations, temperature and rate seen in Figures 13.1, 13.2, and 13.3 can be understood by first looking at \\(t=0\\) where the concentrations of the reagents and the temperature are all at their initial values. At this point the rate has the corresponding value calculated using equations (8), (9), (10), and (2).\nAfter a short interval of time, since the rate is positive, the concentrations of A and B will have decreased slightly and the concentration of Y and Z will have increased slightly due to the occurrence of the reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic and the reactor operates adiabatically, the temperature will have increased due to the heat released by the reaction. The rate could either increase or decrease during this short interval. The concentrations of the reactants, A and B, are decreasing, and this alone would cause the rate to decrease (see equation (2)). However, at the same time the temperature is increasing, and that alone would cause the rate to increase. Generally the exponential dependence of the rate upon the temperature will be stronger than its dependence upon the reactant concentrations and the rate will increase. This is seen to be the case in Figure 13.3. Had the heat of reaction been very small, it is possible that the rate would have decreased.\nThus, during that initial short interval of time, the concentrations of Y and Z, the temperature, and the rate all have positive slopes while the concentrations of A and B have negative slopes. During the next short interval of time, the rate is larger than during the first interval of time. As a consequence, the concentrations and temperature will change more during the second interval. Thus, the curvature of temperature, Y concentration, and Z concentration profiles is initially concave upward and the curvature of the A and B concentration profiles is initially concave downward.\nThe initial curvature of the concentration and temperature profiles is very slight and can’t really be discerned in Figure 13.1 and Figure 13.2. Nonetheless, the initial curvature must change at some later time. Initially the concentrations of A and B are decreasing faster and faster and the concentrations of Y and Z and the temperature are increasing faster and faster. These trends cannot continue indefinitely, if they did, \\(C_Y\\), \\(C_Z\\), and \\(T\\) would approach positive infinity and \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) would approach negative infinity.\nIn fact, the curvature does change because at some point the effect of decreasing reactant concentrations upon the rate becomes stronger than the effect of increasing temperature. At the point where the two effects become equal, the rate reaches a maximum. Beyond the maximum, the effect of decreasing reactant concentration dominates and the rate decreases. This is seen in Figure 13.3.\nAt the point where the rate reaches its maximum value, the concentration and temperature profiles exhibit an inflection point. (Again, in this example this is very, very subtle and cannot be discerned in the figures.) Beyond that point, the \\(C_Y\\), \\(C_Z\\), and \\(T\\) profiles are concave downward and the \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) are concave upward. That is, the changes over time become smaller and smaller. This behavior can continue indefinitely. Eventually the concentrations and temperature will stop changing and become constant. In this example, A is the limiting reactant, and the reaction is irreversible, so the concentrations and temperature will become constant when \\(C_A\\) becomes equal to zero.\n\n\n13.6.2 Parallel Reactions with a Specified Response\nA jacketed, 10 L BSTR is going to be used to process an aqueous solution of A and B. The reactor jacket is perfectly mixed with a volume of 1400 cm3, a heat transfer coefficient of 138 cal ft−2 min−1 K−1 and a heat transfer area of 1200 cm2. Cooling water at 40 °C flows into the jacket at a rate of 100 g min-1. Both the reacting fluid and the cooling water may be taken to have a density of 1 g cm−3 and a heat capacity of 1 cal g−1 K−1.\nSolutions of A and B are ideal and there is no heat of mixing. The reactor will be charged by mixing two separate solutions, one containing only reagent A and the other containing only reagent B, giving a 10 L charge with initial concentrations of 5 mol A L-1 and 7 mol B L-1.

Mole balances are always included in the design equations, and for a BSTR the mole balance is given by Equation 6.8. In this system, there are two reactions taking place, so the summation expands to two terms.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j = \\nu_{i,1}r_1V + \\nu_{i,2}r_2V\n\\]\nThe BSTR is not isothermal, so an energy balance on the reacting fluid, Equation 6.9, is required. There are no shafts or moving boundaries (other than the agitator which is assumed to do negligible work), so the rate of doing work, \\(\\dot{W}\\), is zero and the volume is constant. This is a liquid phase system, so the pressure will also be constant. Since the volume and pressure are constant, their time derivatives are equal to zero.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - \\cancelto{0}{V\\frac{dP}{dt}}  - \\cancelto{0}{P  \\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\]\nThe summation over the reactions, \\(j\\), expands to two terms, and a mass-specific heat capacity of the entire solution is provided, so the sensible heat term can be re-written using that heat capacity, Equation 6.10.\n\\[\nV \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right) \\Rightarrow r_1V \\Delta H_1 + r_2V \\Delta H_2\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} \\Rightarrow \\rho V \\tilde{C}_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\nThe reactor is cooled with chilled water which gains sensible heat from the reacting fluid, so the energy balance on that exchange fluid is given by Equation 6.2.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot Q - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\nThe exchange fluid heat capacity is constant, making the evaluation of the integral trivial.\n\\[\n\\dot m_{ex}\\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT \\Rightarrow \\dot m_{ex}\\tilde C_{p,ex}\\left( T_{ex} - T_{ex,in} \\right)\n\\]\nMomentum balances are not used with BSTRs so the full set of design equations consists of mole balances on each of the reagents, A, B, X, Y, and Z, an energy balance on the reacting fluid, and an energy balance on the exchange fluid.\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on the five reagents are shown in equations (5) through (9).

The instant the fluids are mixed in the reactor can be defined as \\(t=0\\). The solutions used to charge it contain only A and B; \\(n_{A,0}\\) and \\(n_{B,0}\\) can be used to represent the initial molar amounts of A and B. The initial molar amounts of X, Y, and Z are zero. The initial temperature is unknown, but \\(T_0\\) can be used to represent it. The assignment does not mention the initial outlet temperature of the exchange fluid \\(T_{ex,0}\\), so I will assume that the cooling water is flowing before the reagents are mixed so the initial outlet exchange fluid temperature equals the inlet exchange fluid temperature, \\(T_{ex,in}\\). The assignment is to find responses after a reaction time of \\(t_{rxn} = 30 \\text{ min}\\), so that is the stopping criterion.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.2: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving design equations, (5) through (11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\\(t_{rxn}\\)\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_B\\)\n\\(n_{B,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_X\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Y\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T_{ex}\\)\n\\(T_{ex,0} = T_{ex,in}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second step in the general approach for completing isolated reactor modeling assignments is to formulate the solution of the design equations to calculate the reactor outputs, assuming that any missing reactor inputs and process parameters will be available. The reactor outputs in this system are the dependent variables in the IVODEs: \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_X\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\) at \\(t = t_{rxn}\\). The design equations are IVODEs, and in order to solve them, every quantity that appears them or is substituted into them must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables just listed. The initial values and the value of the stopping criterion must also be calculated if not known.\nThe two rates appearing in the design equations are given by equations (3) and (4), which introduce \\(k_1\\), \\(k_2\\), \\(C_A\\), and \\(C_B\\) into the design equations. The rate coefficients can be expressed in terms of the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8, and the concentrations in terms of the molar amounts and the fluid volume, Equation 1.7. The rate of heat transfer can be expressed in terms of the heat transfer coefficient, heat transfer area and temperature difference between the reacting and exchange fluids, Equation 6.18. Finally, the initial molar amounts of A and B can be calculated using their specified initial concentrations.\nThe initial temperature is not specified, indeed, the assignment asks me to find the initial temperature. It is needed as an initial value for solving the design equations, making it a missing value.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\nUpon substitution of equations (12) through (16) into the design equations, they will only contain known constants, the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_X\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\). As such, they can be solved numerically.

The third step in the general approach for completing isolated reactor modeling assignments is to use the results from solving the design equations to calculate the quantities of interest. As noted in the summary at the start of this formulation, the quantities of interest are \\(T\\), \\(T_{ex}\\), and \\(S_{X/Z}\\). The assignment also specifies the value of one response, the conversion, \\(f_A\\), and it must also be calculated using the results from solving the reactor design equations. Solving the reactor design equations yields \\(T\\) and \\(T_{ex}\\) directly. The selectivity and conversion are simply calculated using their definitions, Equation 3.17 and Equation 3.4.\n\n\n\nResponse Calculation\nSolving the design equations will yield the values of the dependent variables after 30 min. Equation (19) can then be used to calculate the conversion of A, and equation (20) can be used to calculate the selectivity for X over Z.\n\\[\nf_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{rxn}} = \\frac{n_{A,0} - n_A \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{rxn}}}{n_{A,0}} \\tag{19}\n\\]\n\\[\nS_{X/Z} \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{rxn}} = \\frac{n_X \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{rxn}}}{n_Z \\Big\\vert_{t=t_{rxn}}} \\tag{20}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fourth step in the general approach for completing isolated reactor modeling assignments is to create the response function that solves the reactor design equations and calculates the quantities of interest as just described. The response function should be passed the missing value, that is, the initial temperature of the reacting fluid, as an argument. The response function should return the quantities of interest and the calculated value of the specified response, namely the conversion of A.\n\n\n\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure:\n\nThe missing input, \\(T_0\\), is passed to it as an argument.\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities, \\(V\\), \\(V_{ex}\\), \\(U\\), \\(A\\), \\(T_{ex,in}\\), \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\), \\(\\rho\\), \\(\\rho_{ex}\\), \\(\\tilde{C}_p\\), \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\), \\(C_{A,0}\\), \\(C_{B,0}\\), \\(\\Delta H_1\\), \\(\\Delta H_2\\), \\(k_{0,1}\\), \\(E_1\\), \\(k_{0,2}\\), \\(E_2\\), and \\(t_{rxn}\\), after converting them to consistent units.\nIt defines a function that evaluates the derivatives in the design equations given values of the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_X\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\). That function\n\nCalculates \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) using equations (12) and (13),\nCalculates \\(C_A\\) and \\(C_B\\) using equations (14) and (15),\nCalculates \\(r_1\\) and \\(r_2\\) using equations (3) and (4),\nCalculates \\(\\dot{Q}\\) using equation (16), and\nEvaluates and returns the values of the derivatives, equations (5) through (11).\n\nThe initial molar amounts of A and B, \\(n_{A,0}\\) and \\(n_{B,0}\\) are calculated using equations (17) and (18).\nThe design equations, (5) through (11), are solved using function defined above, the initial values, and the stopping criterion in Table 13.2 to find \\(n_A\\), \\(n_B\\), \\(n_X\\), \\(n_Y\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\) at \\(t=t_{rxn}\\).\nThe following quantities are calculated (if necessary) and returned.\n\nThe specified response, \\(f_A\\), is calculated using equation (19).\nThe responses of interest, \\(T\\), \\(T_{ex}\\), are known from solving the design equations.\nThe selectivity for X over Z, \\(S_{X/Z}\\), is calculated using equation (20).\n\n\nCalculations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth and final step in the general approach for completing isolated reactor modeling assignments is to use the response function to calculate all quantities of interest. In the present analysis a reactor input, specifically the initial temperature, \\(T_0\\), is unknown, while a response, specifically the fractional conversion of A, \\(f_A\\), is specified. In this situation it is necessary to use the response function to create a trivial residual equation and calculate and the missing unknown using an ATE solver as described in Chapter 12 and earlier in this chapter. Then, knowing the value of the missing input, it can be passed to the response function to find the other responses of interest.\nIn this case, the response function can be thought of as providing the fractional conversion, given the initial temperature. (It also provides some other quantities, but for now, the other quantities can be ignored.) If it is given the correct value of the initial temperature, it will then equal the fractional conversion specified in the assignment. This can be represented as follows where \\(\\Omega\\) is used to represent the response function, \\(f_{A,f}\\) is the conversion specified in the assignment, and \\(T_0\\) is the unknown initial temperature.\n\\[\n\\Omega\\left(T_0\\right) = f_{A,f} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad 0 = \\Omega\\left(T_0\\right) - f_{A,f}\n\\]\nThis can be thought of as a single algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE) that needs to be solved to find \\(T_0\\). The second form above has been written as a residual equation, which is the form used when solving ATEs numerically. Thus, to complete the assignment, I need to solve that trivial residual equation numerically for \\(T_0\\). Then, once I know the initial temperature, I can call the response function passing that value as an argument and it will return the responses of interest, \\(T\\), \\(T_{ex}\\), and \\(S_{X/Z}\\). (It will also return the fractional conversion, but I already know that.)\n\n\n\n\nLetting \\(\\Omega\\left(T_0\\right)\\) represent the fractional conversion returned by the response function, use numerical software that solves algebraic-transcendental equations (ATEs) to solve equation (21) to find the initial temperature that results in the fractional conversion specified in the assignment.\n\n\\[\n0 = \\Omega\\left(T_0\\right) - f_{A,f} \\tag{21}\n\\]\n\nPass the resulting value of \\(T_0\\) to the response function to get the responses of interest, \\(T\\), \\(T_{ex}\\), and \\(S_{X/Z}\\).\n\nResults\nThe calculations were performed as described above, yielding the results shown in Table 13.3.\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.3: Computational results.\n\n\nitem\nvalue\nunits\n\n\n\n\n\\(T_0\\)\n65\n°C\n\n\n\\(T_f\\)\n92.4\n°C\n\n\n\\(T_{ex,out}\\)\n68.2\n°C\n\n\n\\(f_A\\)\n45\n%\n\n\n\\(S_{X/Z}\\)\n4.21\nmol X per mol Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary and Comments\nAn initial temperature of 65 °C is required to reach a conversion of 45% in 30 min. At that time, the temperature of the reacting fluid will be 92.4 °C, the exit temperature of the exchange fluid will be 68.2 °C, and the selectivity will equal 4.21 mol X per mol Z.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Example 13.6.1 and Example 13.6.2 involve response tasks. That is, the assignment provides all of the information needed to solve the reactor design equations. They differ in that Example 13.6.1 provides all of the reactor inputs and process parameters and requests only reactor outputs and responses. In other words it is a simple response task as defined in Chapter 12. In contrast, Example 13.6.2 specifies the value of an output (the conversion) and requests the value of a reactor input, making it a specified-response task. A response function is used to complete both tasks. In the simple response task it is used directly to calculate the requested quantities. In the specified-response task it is first used indirectly to calculate the missing input and then, with that input, it is used directly to calculate the other requested quantities.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.6.3 Maximum Intermediate Yield in Series Reactions\nA BSTR will be charged with 1 atm of A and 2 atm of B at 25 °C.

The temperature of the coolant in the perfectly-mixed jacket is constant and equal to 30°C. Gas phase reactions (1) and (2) take place within the reactor; the corresponding rate expressions are given in equations (3) and (4). The rate coefficients display Arrhenius temperature dependence with pre-exponental factors of 3.34 x 109 and 4.99 x 109 mol cm-3 min-1 atm-2 for reactions (1) and (2) respectively and activation energies of 20.5 and 21.8 kcal mol-1.

It describes the reactor, its operation, and the reactions taking place, including the rate expressions. It asks me to find a reaction time to maximize yield. From these characteristics, I now that this is an isolated reactor modeling assignment. Ffrom Chapter 12, I also know the general approach for solving this type of assignment.\nI like to start assignments by creating a concise summary of the information provided in the assignment.\n\n\n\nReactor: BSTR\nGiven: \\(P_{A,0}=1\\text{ atm}\\), \\(P_{B,0}=2\\text{ atm}\\), \\(T_0 = 25\\text{ °C}\\), \\(V= 2\\text{ L}\\), \\(A= 600\\text{ cm}^2\\), \\(U= 0.6 \\text{ cal cm}^{-2} \\text{ min}^{-1}\\text{ K}^{-1}\\), \\(T_e =30\\text{ °C}\\), \\(k_{0,1} = 3.34 \\times 10^9 \\text{ mol cm}^{-3}\\text{ min}^{-1}\\text{ atm}^{-2}\\), \\(k_{0,2} = 4.99 \\times 10^9 \\text{ mol cm}^{-3}\\text{ min}^{-1}\\text{ atm}^{-2}\\), \\(E_1= 20.5\\text{ kcal mol}^{-1}\\), \\(E_2= 21.8\\text{ kcal mol}^{-1}\\), \\(\\Delta H_1= -6,300 \\text{ cal mol}^{-1}\\), \\(\\Delta H_2= -6,900 \\text{ cal mol}^{-1}\\), \\(\\hat C_{p,A}= 7.4 \\text{ cal mol}^{-1}\\text{ K}^{-1}\\), \\(\\hat C_{p,B}= 8.6 \\text{ cal mol}^{-1}\\text{ K}^{-1}\\), \\(\\hat C_{p,D}= 10.7 \\text{ cal mol}^{-1}\\text{ K}^{-1}\\), \\(\\hat C_{p,Z}= 5.2 \\text{ cal mol}^{-1}\\text{ K}^{-1}\\) and \\(\\hat C_{p,U}= 10.3 \\text{ cal mol}^{-1}\\text{ K}^{-1}\\).\nQuantities of Interest: \\(\\underset{t_{rxn}}{\\arg\\max} \\left(Y_{D/A}\\right)\\), \\(\\max \\left(Y_{D/A}\\right)\\), \\(f_A\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in the general approach to completing isolated reactor modeling assignments is to write the reactor design equations for the reactor. Chapter 6 described how to do this.\nMole balances are always included in the reactor design equations. The general BSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.8.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nI will use this equation to write mole balances for every reagent in the system. That is, I’ll write the mole balance for \\(i\\) = A, B, D, Z, and U. There are two reactions taking place, so the sum will expand to two terms in each mole balance.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\left( \\nu_{i,1}r_1 + \\nu_{i,2}r_2 \\right)V\n\\]\nThis reactor is not isothermal, so I will need to include a BSTR reacting fluid energy balance among the reactor design equations. The BSTR energy balance is given in Equation 6.9\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \\frac{dV}{dt}  = \\dot Q - \\dot W - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\]\nThe reactor has rigid walls and no moving boundaries, so it’s volume is constant. If the volume is constant, the time-derivative of the volume is equal to zero. Being a gas phase system with a constant volume, the pressure is expected to change because the temperature will change. Therefore I cannot set the time-derivative of the pressure equal to zero. With no moving boundaries, the only work is that of the agitator, which is assumed to be negligible.

To do that, I will select a range of values for \\(t_{rxn}\\), calculate the yield for each one, and plot the results. Then I’ll identify the maximum from the graph.

The response function could then solve the reactor design equations and calculate the responses of interest for all of those reaction times, and return them as vectors.\nThis is not always possible. In situations where this can’t be done, the response function would need to be called separately for each reaction time.\n\n\n\nCalculations\n\nThe response function is called, passing to it a vector containing a range of values of \\(t_{rxn}\\). (Note the range of values may need to be adjusted).\nThe response function returns vectors containing the corresponding values of \\(Y_{D/A}\\), and \\(f_A\\).\nThe values of \\(Y_{D/A}\\) are plotted against \\(t_{rxn}\\).\nThe graph resulting from step 3 is inspected.\n\nIf it shows a maximum, the value of \\(t_{rxn}\\) corresponding to the maximum value of \\(Y_{D/A}\\) and the maximum value of \\(Y_{D/A}\\) are two of the quantities of interest. The conversion of A at the value of \\(t_{rxn}\\) corresponding to the maximum value of \\(Y_{D/A}\\) is the other quantity of interest.\nIf it does not show a maximum, the range of values of \\(t_{rxn}\\) is adjusted and steps 2 through 4 are repeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a maximum has been found graphically, the process can be repeated using a large number of values of \\(t_{rxn}\\) packed into a small range that includes the maximum. This will improve the accuracy of the results. These results need not be plotted. Instead they can be tabulated. The largest value of \\(Y_{D/A}\\) can then be identified, and the corresponding value of \\(t_{rxn}\\) can be read from the same row of the table.\n\n\n\nResults\nThe calculations were performed as described above. The resulting plot of yield vs. reaction time is shown in Figure 13.4. The maximum yield, 69.3%, occurs at a reaction time of 11.7 min. The conversion of A at that reaction time is 88.1%.\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: Yield of D as the reaction time varies.\n\n\nSummary and Comments\nReactions (1) and (2) constitute a series-parallel reaction network. The desired product, D, is an intermediate product. It is produced in reaction (1) and consumed in reaction (2). Assuming that the temperature affects the two reactions equally, the yield of an intermediate product is expected to pass through a maximum as the reaction time increases as seen in Figure 13.4.\nThe reason for the maximum is qualitatively easy to understand. At the start of the reaction, the rate of reaction (1) will be positive while that for reaction (2) will be zero. Thus, initially the amount of D will increase as can be seen in Figure 13.4. After a very small interval of time, the rate of reaction (1) will have decreased slightly due to the decreasing concentration of reactant A while the rate of reaction (2) will have increased due to the increasing concentration of reactant D. For as long as the rate of reaction (2) remains smaller than the rate of reaction (1), the amount of D will be increasing, but at a smaller and smaller rate. This can be seen in Figure 13.4 where the curvature of the yield plot is initially concave downward,\nEventually, the rate of reaction (2) will become equal to the rate of reaction (1). For that instant in time, the amount of D will not be changing. This corresponds to the maximum in Figure 13.4. At times beyond the maximum, the rate of reaction (1) will be smaller than the rate of reaction (2), so the concentration of D will decrease. As the concentrations of both reactants, A and D, continue to decrease, both reactions (1) and (2) will become slower and slower. This can be seen at larger reaction times in Figure 13.4 where the curve is concave upward. Eventually, at very large reaction time, the rates will equal zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example series-parallel reactions are occurring where the desired product is produced in one reaction and consumed by another. In this situation it is often found that the reaction time has the greatest effect upon the amount of the desired product, as was the case here. Other process parameters such as the temperature will also affect the results, but often their effect on the amount of desired product is weaker. Temperature can be an effective parameter for adjusting the selectivity of multiple reactions if the activation energies of the reactions differ significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.6.4 Optimization of Net Production Rate\nThe rate expression for liquid-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 2.59 x 109 min-1 and an activation energy of 16.5 kcal mol-1. The heat of reaction (1) may be taken to be constant and equal to -22,200 cal mol-1. A solution containing only A at a concentration of 2 M and a temperature of 23 °C is going to be processed in a BSTR. The heat capacity of the solution is approximately constant and equal to 440 cal L-1 K-1, and its density is constant.\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow Z \\tag{1}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_1 = k_1C_A \\tag{2}\n\\]\nThe 4.0 L BSTR has a perfectly mixed jacket with a volume of 0.5 L, a heat transfer area of 0.6 ft2, and a heat transfer coefficient of 1.13 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1. Cooling water at 20 °C can be fed to the jacket. The water may be taken to have a constant density of 1 g cm-3 and a constant heat capacity of 1 cal g-1 K-1. A heating coil with a heat transfer coefficient of 3.8 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1 and a heat transfer area of 0.23 ft2 can be submerged in and extracted from the reacting solution. Saturated steam at 120 °C can admitted to the coil.\nThe BSTR is charged with 4 L of a 2 M solution of A at 23 °C. Initially there is no flow to the jacket, but it is filled with water, also at 23 °C. To start the batch process, the steam is admitted to the coil, and the coil is immersed in the solution. When the reacting fluid reaches 50 °C, the coil is extracted from the reacting fluid and cooling water flow to the jacket is started. When the reacting fluid reaches a temperature of 25 °C the cooling water flow is stopped, the reactor is drained and preparations for processing the next batch begin. The BSTR pressure is constant throughout all stages of processing. If the turnaround time for the reactor is 25 min, what coolant flow rate will maximize the net rate of production of Z? Plot the conversion of A and the reacting fluid temperature vs. reaction time corresponding to the coolant flow rate that maximizes the net rate and comment on the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the criteria presented in Chapter 12, this is an isolated reactor modeling assignment. The system consists of a BSTR and no other equipment. The reactor and its operation are described. The reaction taking place is indentified and its rate expression is provided, and it asks for a reactor input, namely the coolant flow rate. Additionally, this is an optimization assignment because the coolant flow rate of interest is the one that maximizes the net rate of production of Z.\nHaving identified this as an isolated reactor optimization assignment, I know the general approach to take to complete it, again from Chapter 12. I will need to select the reactor design equations needed to model the system, formulate their solution (assuming missing reactor inputs and process parameters will be provided), formulate the calculation of the response of interest (here the net rate of production of Z), create a response function that incorporates those formulations, and use the response function to calculate the quantities of interest. Being an optimization assignment, I’ll do that by selecting a range of values of the coolant flow rate, calculate the net rate for each of them, plot the results, and identify the maximum net rate using the graph.\nTo get started, I’ll summarize the information provided in the assignment. I’ll use a subscripted “ex” to denote quantities related to the jacket and “coil” to denote quantities related to the coil. I’ll use a subscripted “0” to denote initial values of quantities, a subscripted “1” to denote quantities at the time the temperature reaches 50 °C, and a subscripted “f” to denote quantities at the end of the processing steps.\n\n\n\nReactor: BSTR\nGiven: \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 2.59 x 109 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 16.5 kcal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -22,200 cal mol-1, \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 2 M, \\(T_0\\) = 23 °C, \\(\\breve{C}_p\\) = 440 cal L-1 K-1, \\(V\\) = 4.0 L, \\(V_{ex}\\) = 0.5 L, \\(A_{ex}\\) = 0.6 ft2, \\(U_{ex}\\) = 1.13 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1, \\(T_{ex,in}\\) = 20 °C, \\(\\rho_{ex}\\) = 1 g cm-3, \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\) = 1 cal g-1 K-1, \\(U_{coil}\\) = 3.8 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1, \\(A_{coil}\\) = 0.23 ft2, \\(T_{coil}\\) = 120 °C, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) = 23 °C, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex,0}\\) = 0, \\(T_1\\) = 50 °C, \\(T_f\\) = 25 °C, \\(t_{turn}\\) = 25 min.\nQuantities of Interest: \\(\\dot{m}_{ex,opt} = \\underset{\\dot{m}_{ex}}{\\arg\\max} \\left(r_{Z,net}\\right)\\), \\(\\underset{\\dot{m}_{ex}}{\\max} \\left(r_{Z,net}\\right)\\), \\(f_A\\left(t\\right)\\Big\\vert_{\\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}\\), \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\Big\\vert_{\\dot{m}_{ex,opt}}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nI need to write the reactor design equations needed to model this system. The reactor design equations always include at least one mole balance. The general BSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.8. I’ll write a mole balance for both of the reagents in this system, noting that the sum reduces to a single term since only one reaction is taking place.\n\\[\n\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\sum_j \\nu_{i,j}r_j\n\\]\nThe BSTR is not isothermal, so I must include an energy balance on the reacting fluid among the design equations. The general BSTR mole balance is given in Equation 6.9. Assuming the liquid to be incompressible and the reactor walls to be rigid, both the pressure and volume will be constant, so their time-derivatives will equal zero. The work associated with mixing the reactor can also be assumed to be negligible.\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt} - V\\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dP}{dt}}  - P  \\cancelto{0}{\\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \\dot Q - \\cancelto{0}{\\dot W} - V \\sum_j \\left(r_j \\Delta H_j \\right)\n\\]\nThere is only one reaction occurring, so the final sum will reduce to a single term. In addition, the assignment provides the volumetric heat capacity of the entire solution, so the sensible heat term can be written in terms of that heat capacity, Equation 6.10. Heat is exchanged with both the cooling water and the steam, so the rate of heat exchange must be split into two terms\n\\[\n\\left(\\sum_i n_i \\hat C_{p,i} \\right) \\frac{dT}{dt}\\ \\Leftrightarrow\\  V \\breve C_p \\frac{dT}{dt}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q} = \\dot{Q}_{ex} + \\dot{Q}_{coil}\n\\]\nThere are two heat exchange fluids in this system. The water in the jacket exchanges sensible heat so the energy balance on it is given by Equation 6.2. Noting that the heat capacity is constant, the integral is easily evaluated.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\\dot{Q}_{ex} - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\]\nThe steam in the coil exchanges latent heat, so the its temperature is known and constant. As a consequence, the mole balances, energy balance on the reacting fluid and energy balance on the cooling water can be solved independently of the energy balance on the steam. The problem does not ask any questions about the steam flow rate or how much of it condenses, so an energy balance on the steam is not needed.\nMomentum balances are not used for stirred tank reactors, so the full set of reactor design equations consists of mole balances on A and Z, an energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the cooling water.\n\n\n\nReactor Model\nMole balances on A and Z are presented in equations (3) and (4).

I could analyze the entire process all at once, but here I’m going to analyze it as two phases: the heating phase and the cooling phase.\nThe instant the solution is added to the reactor can be defined as \\(t=0\\). This marks the start of the heating phase. The molar amounts of A, \\(n_{A,0}\\), and Z, 0.0 (only A is present initially), the reacting fluid temperature, \\(T_0\\), and the cooling water temperature, \\(T_{ex,0}\\), at that time are then the initial values for the analysis of the heating phase. It ends when the reacting fluid reaches \\(T_1 = 50 °C\\).\nThe cooling phase begins the instant the heating phase ends, so the initial values for the cooling phase are the final values from the heating phase. The cooling phase ends when the reacting fluid cools down to \\(T_f = 25 °C\\), so that is the stopping criterion for the cooling phase.\n\n\n\nThe initial values and stopping criterion for solving the reactor design equations for the heating phase are presented in Table 13.5.

Thus, the initial values and stopping criterion for the coolling phase are given in Table 13.6\n\n\nTable 13.5: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, (3) through (6), for the heating phase of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(0\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n0\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_0\\)\n\\(T_1\\)\n\n\n\\(T_{ex}\\)\n\\(T_{ex,0}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.6: Initial values and stopping criterion for solving the design equations, (3) through (6), for the cooling phase of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nInitial Value\nStopping Criterion\n\n\n\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t_1\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_A\\)\n\\(n_{A,1}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(n_Z\\)\n\\(n_{Z,1}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(T\\)\n\\(T_1\\)\n\\(T_f\\)\n\n\n\\(T_{ex}\\)\n\\(T_{ex,1}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to solve the reactor design equations, every quantity appearing in them or substituted into them must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\). The initial values and stopping criterion must also be calculated.\nLooking at the reactor design equations, I see that \\(V\\), \\(\\breve{C}_p\\), \\(\\Delta H_1\\), \\(\\rho_{ex}\\), \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\), and \\(T_ex,in\\) are known constants. The water flow rate, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\), will equal 0 until the reacting fluid temperature reaches 50 °C. After that, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) will be constant with a value that will be provided at the time the reactor design equations are solved.\nThe reaction rate, \\(r_1\\), is given by equation (2); it introduces \\(k_1\\) and \\(C_A\\) when it is substituted into the design equations. The rate coefficient can be expressed in terms of known constants (\\(k_{0,1}\\), \\(E_1\\), and the gas constant, \\(R\\)) using the Arrhenius expression, Equation 4.8. The concentration of A can be expressed in terms of the molar amount of A and the volume using the definition of concentration.\nThe rate of heat exchange between the water in the jacket and the reacting fluid can be expressed in terms of the known constants, \\(A_{ex}\\) and \\(U_{ex}\\), and the jacket and reacting fluid temperatures. Similarly, the rate of heat exchange between the steam in the coil and the reacting fluid can be expressed in terms of the kknown constants, \\(U_{coil}\\), \\(A_{coil}\\), and \\(T_{coil}\\) = 120 °C, and the reacting fluid temperature. However, the coil only exchanges heat until the reacting fluid reaches 50 °C.\nThe initial moles of A can be calculated from the known initial concentration of A and the volume.\n\n\n\nAncillary Equations\nThe water flow rate is given by equation (7), and the rate of heat exchange with the steam by equation (8). Both of these terms change when the heating phase ends and the cooling phase begins. The rate of heat exchange between the water in the jacket and the reacting fluid is given by equation (9).\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{ex} \\big\\vert_{t \\lt t_1} = 0 \\qquad \\qquad \\dot{m}_{ex} \\big\\vert_{t \\ge t_1} = \\dot{m}_{ex} \\tag{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{coil}\\big\\vert_{t \\lt t_1} = U_{coil} A_{coil} \\left(T_{coil} - T\\right) \\qquad \\qquad \\dot{Q}_{coil}\\big\\vert_{t \\ge t_1} = 0 \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\dot{Q}_{ex} = U_{ex} A_{ex} \\left(T_{ex} - T\\right) \\tag{9}\n\\]\nThe rate is given by equation (2), where the rate coefficient is found using equation (10) and the concentration of A is found using equation (11). The initial molar amount of A can be calculated using equation (12).\n\\[\nk_1 = k_{0,1}\\exp{\\left( \\frac{-E_1}{RT} \\right)} \\tag{10}\n\\]\n\\[\nC_A = \\frac{n_A}{V} \\tag{11}\n\\]\n\\[\nn_{A,0} = C_{A,0}V \\tag{12}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the only thing needed in order to solve the design equations is the value of the cooling water flow rate, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\). Because this is an optimization problem, I will adjust its value so I can create data for a plot of conversion vs. coolant flow rate. Assuming that value will be provided when needed, the design equations can be solved to find \\(n_A\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\) at times between \\(t=0\\) and the time, \\(t_f\\), when the reactor cools to 25 °C. The conversion as a function of processing time can be calculated using its definition, Equation 3.4. The final time and the final molar amount of A can then be used to calculate the net rate of production of Z, using Equation 13.1.\n\n\n\nAdjusted Value: \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\)\nResponse Calculation\nSolving the reactor design equations will yield \\(n_A\\left(t\\right)\\) and \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\) directly. The conversion as a function of reaction time can then be calculated using equation (13). The final reaction time, \\(t_f\\), and the final molar amount of Z, \\(n_Z\\), can be used to calculate the net rate of production of Z using equation (14).\n\\[\nf_A\\left(t\\right) = \\frac{n_{A,0} - n_A\\left(t\\right)}{n_{A,0}} \\tag{13}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{Z,net} = \\frac{n_Z}{t_f + t_{turn}} \\tag{14}\n\\]\nResponse Function\nThe response function is created with the following structure:\n\nThe adjusted value, that is the coolant flow rate, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\), is passed to the response function as an argument.\nVariables are defined and assigned the values of all known and given quantities: \\(k_{0,1}\\) = 2.59 x 109 min-1, \\(E_1\\) = 16.5 kcal mol-1, \\(\\Delta H_1\\) = -22,200 cal mol-1, \\(C_{A,0}\\) = 2 M, \\(T_0\\) = 23 °C, \\(\\breve{C}_p\\) = 440 cal L-1 K-1, \\(V\\) = 4.0 L, \\(V_{ex}\\) = 0.5 L, \\(A_{ex}\\) = 0.6 ft2, \\(U_{ex}\\) = 1.13 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1, \\(T_{ex,in}\\) = 20 °C, \\(\\rho_{ex}\\) = 1 g cm-3, \\(\\tilde{C}_{p,ex}\\) = 1 cal g-1 K-1, \\(U_{coil}\\) = 3.8 x 104 cal ft-2 h-1 K-1, \\(A_{coil}\\) = 0.23 ft2, \\(T_{coil}\\) = 120 °C, \\(T_{ex,0}\\) = 23 °C, \\(\\dot{m}_{ex,0}\\) = 0, \\(T_1\\) = 50 °C, \\(T_f\\) = 25 °C, \\(t_{turn}\\) = 25 min.\nA function is defined that evaluates the derivatives in the design equations given values of the independent variable, \\(t\\), and the dependent variables, \\(n_A\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\). Specifically, it\n\nSets the value of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) according to equation (7).\nCalculates \\(\\dot{Q}_{coil}\\), \\(\\dot{Q}_{ex}\\), \\(k_1\\), and \\(C_A\\) using equations (8) through (11).\nCalculates \\(r_1\\) using equation (2).\nEvaluates and returns the values of the derivatives, equations (3) through (6).\n\nThe response function then\n\nCalculates \\(n_{A,0}\\) using equation (12).\nSolves the design equations for the heating phase using the function defined above and the initial values and stopping criterion in Table 13.5 to find the final values of \\(t_1\\), \\(n_{A,1}\\), \\(n_{Z,1}\\), and \\(T_{ex,1}\\).\nSolves the design equations for the cooling phase using the initial values and stopping criterion in@tbl-example_13_4_cooling_initial_values to find the values of \\(t\\), \\(n_A\\), \\(n_Z\\), \\(T\\), and \\(T_{ex}\\) at the end of the processing.\nCalculates the conversion as a function of reaction time using equation (13) and the net rate of production of Z using equation (14).\nReturns the net rate of production of Z and vectors containing the reaction time, conversion and reacting fluid temperature.\n\n\nCalculations\n\nA range of values of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) is chosen. (Note the range of values may need to be adjusted.)\nThe response function is used to calculate \\(r_{Z,net}\\) for each value of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\).\nThe resulting values of \\(r_{Z,net}\\) are plotted against \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\).\nThe graph produced in step 3 is inspected.\n\nIf it shows a maximum, the value of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) corresponding to the maximum value of \\(r_{Z,net}\\) and the maximum value of \\(r_{Z,net}\\) are the quantities of interest.\nIf it does not show a maximum, the range of values of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) is adjusted and steps 2 through 4 are repeated.\n\nThe response function is used to calculate \\(t\\), \\(f_A\\left(t\\right)\\), and \\(T\\left(t\\right)\\) using the optimum coolant rate found in step 4.\nThe conversion and reacting fluid temperature are plotted vs. the reaction time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a maximum has been found graphically, the process can be repeated using a large number of values of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) packed into a small range that includes the maximum. This will improve the accuracy of the results. These results need not be plotted. Instead they can be tabulated. The largest value of \\(r_{Z,net}\\) can then be identified, and the corresponding value of \\(\\dot{m}_{ex}\\) can be read from the same row of the table.\n\n\n\nResults\nThe calculations were performed as described above. The net rate of production of Z is plotted as a function of the cooling water flow rate in Figure 13.5. The maximum net rate, 0.063 mol/min, occurs at a coolant flow rate of 183 g/min. The conversion and reacting fluid temperature profiles at that coolant flow rate are shown in Figure 13.6 and Figure 13.7. Knowing the initial concentration of A and the Arrhenius parameters, the conversion and temperature profiles were used to calculate the reaction rate profile shown in Figure 13.8, where the rate scale is logarithmic.\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Net rate of production of Z as cooling water flow rate varies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: Conversion profile during processing with the optimum coolant flow rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: Temperature profile during processing with the optimum coolant flow rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Instantaneous reaction rate profile during processing with the optimum coolant flow rate.\n\n\nSummary and Comments\nAt the initial conditions, the instantaneous rate of reaction is extremely small as can be seen in Figure 13.8, and consequently conversion of A initially increases very slowly, Figure 13.6. For this reason, the steam heating coil is used to heat the reacting fluid to 50 °C. This requires ca. 3.5 min and can be seen in Figure 13.7 and Figure 13.5 as an abrupt decrease in the slope at that time.\nOnce the steam heating coil is removed, heat is being generated due to the heat of reaction and simulataneously heat is being removed by transfer to the cooling water in the jacket. The rate of heat generation must be greater than the rate of heat removal, because Figure 13.7 shows that the temperature continues to rise.\nAs the reaction proceeds, the temperature is increasing while the concentration of reactant A is decreasing due to consumption by reaction. The increasing temperature alone would cause the rate to increase while the decrease in reactant concentration, alone, would cause the rate to decrease. As is very often the case, the effect of increasing temperature is stronger than the effect of decreasing concentration, so the rate increases. This, in turn, causes the temperature to rise even faster, as can be seen in the temperature profile just after the end of the heating phase where the profile is concave downward.\nEventually the effects upon the rate of increasing temperature and decreasing concentration become equal. This corresponds to the maximum in the instantaneous reaction rate profile, Figure 13.8, at ca 31.1 min.. At this point, the temperature profile, Figure 13.7, displays an inflection point. For a brief period after the rate reaches its maximum, the temperature continues to rise, reaching a maximum value of 88 °C at ca. 31.5 min.. This happens because while the rate is starting to decrease, the reaction is still generating heat faster than the cooling water is removing it.\nOnce the temperature passes through its maximum, heat is being removed by transfer to the cooling water in the jacket faster than it is being generated by reaction. As a result the temperature and rate decrease steadily. Nonetheless, the conversion had already reached 90% when the temperature started to decrease and ultimately increased to 99.3% by the time the reacting fluid cooled to 25 °C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the net rate of reaction was maximized with respect to the cooling water flow rate. It might be possible to improve the process further by adjusting both the cooling water flow rate and the temperature where the heating coil is removed. If that were done, the graphical approach used here to maximize the net rate would not be the best mathematical approach. Instead, a reaction engineer might use software designed for multivariable optimization."

Suppose the rate can be described using a rate expression that is first order in acetic anhydride with a pre-exponential factor of 1.192 x 1015 min-1 and an activation energy of 97,600 J mol-1. The heat of reaction may be taken to be constant and equal to -58,615 J mol-1. The reacting fluid in the semi-batch reactor for the process is cooled by an external fluid uniformly maintained at 60 °C; the product of the heat transfer area and the heat transfer coefficient, \\(UA\\), equals 260 cal min-1 K-1. The reactor operates at atmospheric pressure and initially contains 67 cm3 of water, 283 cm3 of acetic acid (the solvent and product) and 0.30 cm3 of sulfuric acid at 60 °C. The heat capacity of the fluid in the reactor may be taken to be constant and equal to 2.68 J cm-3 K-1. Acetic anhydride at 21 °C is fed to the reactor at a rate of 64.5 cm3 min-1 for the first 5.5 minutes of operation, after which the reaction continues in batch mode. The solution may be assumed to be ideal with a constant density.

    "section": "C.1 Heats of Reaction",
    "text": "C.1 Heats of Reaction\nThe heat of reaction appears in the energy balances for the ideal reactors considered in Reaction Engineering Basics. The heat of reaction also changes with temperature. As such, it is essential that students know how to calculate the heat of reaction at any given temperature.\nThe heat, \\(\\Delta H_j\\), of an arbitrary reaction, \\(j\\), is defined as the change in enthalpy when stoichiometric amounts of the reactants in reaction \\(j\\) are completely converted to stoichiometric amounts of the products of the reaction. This is true, even if the equilibrium conversion for reaction \\(j\\) is less than 100%. The heat of reaction does not depend upon the conversion, it is defined in terms of complete conversion.\nIf heat is released when reaction \\(j\\) occurs, reaction \\(j\\) is said to be an exothermic reaction, and \\(\\Delta H_j\\) will be negative. Conversely, if heat is consumed when reaction \\(j\\) occurs, reaction \\(j\\) is said to be an endothermic reaction, and \\(\\Delta H_j\\) will be positive.\nThe units of the heat of reaction are energy per mole. The “mole” in the units is a mole of extent of reaction for the reaction, as written.\nTypically, the calculation of the heat of reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the standard heat of reaction at 298 K is calculated. Then that result is used to calculate the heat of reaction at any other temperature. The next two sub-sections describe these two steps.\n\nC.1.1 The Standard Heat of Reaction at 298 K\nThe standard heat of formation at 298 K of some species, \\(i\\), \\(\\Delta H_{f,i}^0 \\Bigr\\rvert_{T=298K}\\), is the heat of the reaction in which one mole of species \\(i\\) (in its standard state) is synthesized at 298 K from the elements that it comprises (in their standard states). Standard heats of formation of many reagents at 298 K are tabulated in various handbooks; selected lists often appear in thermodynamics textbooks, too. Tables of this type should indicate the standard state that has been used for species \\(i\\) and each of the elements.\nThe widespread availability of tables containing standard heats of formation is important because the standard heat of any reaction, \\(j\\), at 298 K can be calculated from the standard heats of formation of the reactants and products in reaction \\(j\\). Specifically, Equation C.1 is used to calculate the standard heat of reaction \\(j\\) from the standard heats of formation of its reactants and products. Equation C.1 uses the Reaction Engineering Basics sign convention wherein the stoichiometric coefficients of reactants are negative and the stoichiometric coefficients of products are positive.\n\\[\n\\Delta H_j^0\\Bigr\\rvert_{T=298K} = \\sum_i \\left( \\nu_{i,j} \\Delta H_{f,i}^0\\Bigr\\rvert_{T=298K} \\right)\n\\tag{C.1}\\]\nAn alternative to using standard heats of formation is to use the standard heat of combustion of the reactants and products at 298 K. The standard heat of combustion at 298 K of some species \\(i\\), \\(\\Delta H_{c,i}^0 \\biggr\\rvert_{T=298K}\\), is the heat of the reaction in which species \\(i\\) is completely oxidized by O2 at 298 K, usually producing CO2 and H2O(l), and with all species in their standard states. Standard heats of combustion are tabulated in handbooks and textbooks, just as standard heats of formation are. Standard heats of combustion are particularly convenient for use with hydrocarbons. If reagent \\(i\\) contains elements other than C, O and H, the table providing the value of the standard heat of combustion should indicate the additional combustion products and their standard states. Equation C.2 is used to calculate the standard heat of reaction \\(j\\) from the standard heats of combustion of its reactants and products.\n\\[\n\\Delta H_j^0\\Bigr\\rvert_{T=298K} = \\sum_i \\left( -\\nu_{i,j} \\Delta H_{c,i}^0\\Bigr\\rvert_{T=298K} \\right)\n\\tag{C.2}\\]\n\n\nC.1.2 The Standard Heat of Reaction at Temperature T\nAssuming none of the reactants and products in reaction \\(j\\) undergo a phase change between 298 K and T, the standard heat of reaction \\(j\\) at arbitrary temperature, \\(T\\), can be calculated using Equation C.3. If one of the reagents does undergo a phase change, the latent heat for that phase change would need to be included in the equation.\n\\[\n\\Delta H_j^0 = \\Delta H_j^0\\Bigr\\rvert_{T=298K} + \\sum_i \\left( \\nu_{i,j} \\int_{298\\text{ K}}^T \\hat C_{p,i}dT \\right)\n\\tag{C.3}\\]"

    "section": "C.2 Adiabatic Temperature",
    "text": "C.2 Adiabatic Temperature\nConsider an exothermic chemical reaction that takes place adiabatically in a system with no shafts or moving boundaries. Since there are no shafts or moving boundaries, no energy enters or leaves the system in the form of work. As the exothermic reaction takes place, the standard heat of reaction is released. It cannot leave the system because it is an adiabatic process. Consequently, the heat released by the exothermic reaction is converted into internal molecular energy. From a macroscopic perspective the result is that the temperature of the system increases. That is, the heat released by the reaction is used to raise the temperature of the reacting system. This assumes that no phase changes occur as the reaction takes place.\nWhen the reaction process ends, the system will be at a new temperature that is sometimes referred to as the adiabatic temperature. In the case of an exothermic reaction, this temperature will be greater than the starting temperature, and the change in temperature is referred to as the adiabatic temperature rise. For an endothermic reaction the system temperature would decrease, resulting in an adiabatic temperature drop. For the remainder of this discussion, we can generalize by simply referring to the adiabatic temperature change, noting that if the reaction is exothermic it will be a rise and if the reaction is endothermic it will be a drop.\nNotice that one doesn’t need to know anything about the container holding the system, i. e. the reactor, other than it operates adiabatically and without any shafts or moving boundaries. The adiabatic temperature can be computed using only thermodynamic quantities. Typically in reaction engineering, the goal is to calculate the adiabatic temperature change given the starting composition and temperature and the final composition. Knowing the initial and final amounts of the reagents, it is possible to calculate the apparent extents (see Chapter 3) of a complete mathematically independent subset of the reactions occurring in the system. The essential concept when calculating the adiabatic temperature is that the heat released or absorbed by reaction must just equal the change in the sensible heat of the reagents.\nEnthalpy is a state function, so it is not necessary to perform the calculations using the exact path followed by the reacting system. Any path that starts at the same initial conditions and ends at the same final conditions can be used. For analysis purposes, it is convenient to use a pathway where the reactions first occur isothermally at the initial temperature and then the resulting product mix is heated (or cooled) to the final temperature. The net \\(\\Delta H\\) for the two steps is then set equal to zero, giving an implicit equation for the final, adiabatic temperature as shown in Equation C.4 which assumes that no phase changes occur as the reaction takes place.\n\\[\n\\sum_{j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime}\\left( - \\Delta H_{j^\\prime}\\Big \\vert_{T_0} \\right) = \\sum_i \\int_{T_0}^{T_{ad}} \\hat C_{p,i} \\left( n_{i,0} + \\nu_{i,j^\\prime} \\xi_{j^\\prime} \\right)dT\n\\tag{C.4}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions ocurring in the system.\nGiven only the initial amounts of the reagents and the requisite thermodynamic data, Equation C.4 provides a relationship between the final temperature and the extents of reaction."

    "section": "C.4 Equilibrium Composition",
    "text": "C.4 Equilibrium Composition\nKnowing the initial composition of a system, the reactions taking place, the final temperature and, for gases, the final pressure, the equilibrium composition of the system can be calculated. Doing this won’t be necessary in Reaction Engineering Basics, but it is an important skill that a reaction engineer needs. It can be important in the early stages of designing a reactor system and whenever reaction engineering tasks involve reversible reactions.\nThe reactions taking place in the system may not be mathematically independent. The first step in calculating the equilibrium composition of a system is to identify a complete, mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place. Appendix A includes a section that describes how to do so. Here, for convenience, the reactions in the complete mathematically independent subset of the reactions taking place will simply be referred to as “the independent reactions.”\nHaving identified the independent reactions, an equilibrium expression, Equation C.8, can be written for each of them.\n\\[\nK_{j^\\prime} = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}}\n\\tag{C.8}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions ocurring in the system.\nThe thermodynamic activity, \\(a_i\\), of each species, \\(i\\), in the equilibrium expressions can be related to the composition. For an ideal liquid solution, the activity is simply equal to the mole fraction, Equation C.9. For an ideal gas, the activity is the partial pressure divided by the standard state of 1 atm, Equation C.10.\n\\[\na_i = x_i \\quad \\text{(ideal liquid solution)}\n\\tag{C.9}\\]\n\\[\na_i = \\frac{P_i}{1 \\text{ atm}} = \\frac{y_iP}{1 \\text{ atm}} \\quad \\text{(ideal gas)}\n\\tag{C.10}\\]\nFinally, the mole fractions can be expressed in terms of the apparent extents of the independent reactions. For example the gas phase mole fraction of reagent \\(i\\) in a closed system would be written as shown in Equation C.11. Similar equations are used for liquid phase systems (where \\(x_i\\) is used instead of \\(y_i\\)) and for open, steady-state systems (where \\(\\dot n_i\\), \\(\\dot n_{i,in}\\) and \\(\\dot \\xi\\) are used instead of \\(n_i\\), \\(n_{i,0}\\) and \\(\\xi\\)).\n\\[\ny_i = \\frac{n_i}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i n_i} = \\frac{n_{i,0} + \\displaystyle \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}\\xi_{j^\\prime}}{\\displaystyle \\sum_i \\left( n_{i,0} + \\sum_{j^\\prime}\\nu_{i,j^\\prime}\\xi_{j^\\prime}\\right)}\n\\tag{C.11}\\]\n\\(\\qquad\\) where \\(j^\\prime\\) indexes the reactions in a complete, mathematically\n\\(\\qquad \\qquad\\) independent subset of the reactions ocurring in the system.\nIf \\(N\\) is the number of independent reactions, then after substitution for the activities and mole fractions as just described, Equation C.8 can be used to write a set of \\(N\\) equilibrium expressions containing \\(N\\) unknown apparent extents of reaction. Those equations can be solved to find the equilibrium extents of reaction which, in turn, can be used to calculate the equilibrium mole fractions or any other measure of the equilibrium composition."

    "text": "D.1 Mass and Energy Balances on the Heat Exchange Fluid\nFigure D.1 depicts batch, semi-batch and continuous stirred tank reactors with heat exchange. Figure D.2 similarly depicts a tubular reactor with heat exchange. The figures are not intended to convey the actual geometry of the reactors. The blue shading represents the reacting fluid within the reactor and the yellow shading represents perfectly-mixed heat exchange fluid within the shell/jacket. The red line represents the wall separating the reacting fluid from the heat exchange fluid. Heat is transferred through this wall, all other walls are assumed to be perfectly insulated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Batch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Semi-Batch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Continuous\n\n\n\n\nFigure D.1: Stirred Tank Heat Exchange\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure D.2: Tubular Reactor with Heat Exchange\n\n\nThe inputs, outputs and flow patterns on the reaction side differ for each of the four reactors shown in Figures D.1 and D.2. However, the inputs, outputs and flow pattern on the shell/jacket sides of the four reactors are identical. Consequently, the mass balance and the energy balance on the heat exchange fluid is the same for all four reactors.\n\nD.1.1 Mass Balance on the Heat Exchange Fluid\nIn Reaction Engineering Basics it is always assumed that there is no accumulation of mass in the reactor shell/jacket. Mass cannot be generated (other than by nuclear reactions), so there is no generation of mass within the reactor shell/jacket, either. Consequently the inlet and outlet mass flow rates are always equal, as shown in the figures. Note that the mass flow rate of the heat exchange fluid can vary with time, but any change in the inlet mass flow rate is accompanied instantaneously by an equal change in the outlet mass flow rate.\n\n\nD.1.2 Energy Balance on the Heat Exchange Fluid\nAs noted, in Reaction Engineering Basics the heat exchange fluid undergoes either a temperature change or a phase change, but not both. The form of the energy balance is different for each of these situations.\nEnergy Balance for Exchange of Sensible Heat\nWith the assumptions of no mass accumulation in the shell/jacket and that the heat exchange fluid does not undergo phase change, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid takes the form shown in Equation D.1.\n\\[\n\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\tilde C_{p,ex}\\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = \\dot Q_{ex} - \\dot m_{ex} \\int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \\tilde C_{p,ex}dT\n\\tag{D.1}\\]\nEnergy Balance for Exchange of Latent Heat\nAgain assuming no accumulation of mass in the shell/jacket, and additionally assuming that the temperature of the heat exchange fluid does not change, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid takes the form shown in Equation D.2. Typically, if the reacting fluid is being heated, the heat exchange fluid enters the shell/jacket as a saturated vapor. Within the shell/jacket, some fraction, \\(\\gamma\\), of the heat exchange fluid condenses. This occurs at a constant and known temperature, namely, the boiling point. Less commonly, if the reacting fluid is being cooled by boiling the heat exchange fluid, the heat exchange fluid enters the shell/jacket as a saturated liquid, and within the shell/jacket, some fraction of the heat exchange fluid vaporizes.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}} \\frac{d \\gamma}{dt} = \\dot Q_{ex} - \\gamma \\dot m_{ex} \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{latent},ex}^0}{M_{ex}}\n\\tag{D.2}\\]\nThe maximum latent heat that can be provided or removed corresponds to complete condensation or complete vaporization of the heat exchange fluid. That is, the maximum amount of heat is exchanged with \\(\\gamma\\) is equal to 1.\nIn both Equation D.1 and Equation D.2, the rate of heat input into the reacting fluid, \\(\\dot Q\\), and the rate of heat input to the shell/jacket, \\(\\dot Q_e\\) are related as shown in Equation D.3.\n\\[\n\\dot Q_e = - \\dot Q\n\\tag{D.3}\\]"

As a consequence, the temperature difference between the reacting fluid and the heat exchange fluid changes along the length of the tube. That means that the rate of heat transfer also varies along the length of the tube.

They are assumed to be in constant motion, with the full mass of each particle located at a point that is moving in space. Each kind of molecule has its own collision radius. Beyond their collision radii, the molecules exert no forces on each other, but when the distance between two molecules equals the sum of those molecules’ collision radii, they exert an infinite repulsive force on each other. This is commonly described by saying the molecules behave as hard spheres when they collide, but there is a significant difference. Hard spheres can have angular momentum due to spin, and they can transfer angular momentum when they collide. In the kinetic theory of gases, the mass of the molecules is all located at a point, so they cannot have angular momentum. Collisions between molecules are assumed to be perfectly elastic. This means that when two gas molecules collide there is no change in the total translational kinetic energy. As Figure E.1 (a) shows, an A molecule and a B molecule will collide when the distance between their centers equals the sum of their collision radii.\n\n\n\nFigure E.1: Collisions According to the Kinetic Theory of Gases (a) Two point masses collide when the distance between them equals the sum of their collision radii.

    "section": "E.3 Collision Theory",
    "text": "E.3 Collision Theory\nThe kinetic theory of gases doesn’t include any attractive or repulsive forces between molecules except at the instant they collide. As a consequence, when an A molecule travels through space (between collisions) its center traces out a straight line (not a curve). This straight line can be used as the axis of a cylinder with a radius equal to the sum of the collision radii of an A molecule and a B molecule, Figure E.1 (b). Thus as the A molecule travels through space it sweeps out a cylindrical volume and a collision will occur if a B molecule has its center within this cylinder. The cross-sectional area of this cylinder is called the collision cross-section, \\(\\sigma_{AB}\\). The collision cross section is calculated using Equation E.3.\n\\[\n\\sigma _{AB}=\\pi \\left(R_A + R_B\\right)^2\n\\tag{E.3}\\]\nIt is next assumed that B molecules are uniformly distributed throughout space. If \\(N_B^*\\) equals the number of B molecules per unit volume, then on average, there will be one B molecule in a volume, \\(V_B^*\\), as given by Equation E.4.\n\\[\nV_B^* = \\frac{1}{N_B^*}\n\\tag{E.4}\\]\nThe cylindrical volume swept out by a single A molecule before it collides with a B molecule will equal \\(V_B^*\\). The distance, \\(L\\), traveled by the A molecule before it undergoes collision can then be found using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, Equation E.5.\n\\[\nL=\\frac{V_B^*}{\\sigma _{AB}}\n\\tag{E.5}\\]\nThe amount of time, \\(t\\), it takes the A molecule to travel the distance \\(L\\) can be found from its velocity, \\(u\\), relative to the B molecule with which it collides using Equation E.6 which is a simple rearrangement of the definition of a velocity.\n\\[\nt=\\frac{L}{u}\n\\tag{E.6}\\]\nThus, Equation E.6 can be used to find how long it takes, on average, for an A molecule to collide with a single B molecule. Substituting Equation E.5 into Equation E.6 leads to Equation E.7 for the amount of time, \\(t_{\\text{single}}\\), required for an A molecule to have a single collision with a B molecule.\n\\[\nt_{\\text{single}}=\\frac{V_B^*}{u\\sigma _{AB}}\n\\tag{E.7}\\]\nThe time calculated using Equation E.7 is the period of the collisions of the A molecule with B molecules. The frequency of collisions of a single A molecule with a B molecule is equal to the reciprocal of this period. This frequency is only for collisions between the single A molecule under consideration and a B molecule. If \\(\\nu\\) is used to represent frequency, the frequency of collisions of a single A molecule moving with a velocity, \\(u\\), is then given by Equation E.8.\n\\[\n\\nu_{\\text{single,u}} = \\frac{u\\sigma _{AB}}{V_B^*}\n\\tag{E.8}\\]\nThe frequency of collisions involving all A molecules that are moving with one particular velocity, \\(u\\), is found by multiplying the frequency of collisions for a single A molecule by the total number of A molecules that are moving with that velocity, Equation E.9.\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{frequency of collisions}\\\\\\text{involving all A molecules}\\\\\\text{that have a velocity of } u \\end{pmatrix} =  \\begin{pmatrix}\\text{frequency of collisions}\\\\\\text{of a single A molecule}\\\\\\text{that has a velocity of } u \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{number of A}\\\\\\text{molecules that}\\\\\\text{have a velocity of } u \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\nu_{\\text{all,u}} = \\frac{u\\sigma _{AB}}{V_B^*}dN_A^*\n\\tag{E.9}\\]\nThe frequency of all collisions between A molecules and B molecules (i. e. with any velocity) is found by summing Equation E.9 over all possible velocities. To do this, the Boltzmann distribution function, Equation E.1, is substituted into Equation E.9 along with substitution of Equation E.4. Since the velocity distribution is continuous, the summation takes the form of an integral over all possible velocities. The frequency of all collisions between A and B molecules is often called a collision number. The symbol \\(Z_{AB}^{\\prime}\\) is used here to represent the frequency of all collisions between A molecules and B molecules, Equation E.10.\n\\[\nZ_{AB}^{\\prime}=\\sum_u \\nu_{\\text{all,u}} = \\sum_u \\left(\\frac{u\\sigma _{AB}}{V_B^*}dN_A^*\\right)\n\\]\n\\[\nZ_{AB}^{\\prime}=\\int_{u=0}^{u=\\infty}\\left(4\\pi N_A^*N_B^*u^3\\sigma _{AB}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_BT}\\right)^{3/2}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\mu u^2}{2k_BT}\\right)}du\n\\]\n\\[\nZ_{AB}^{\\prime}=N_A^*N_B^*\\sigma _{AB}\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\n\\tag{E.10}\\]\nSome of the collisions between the A molecules and the B molecules will involve very small relative velocities along the centerline between the molecules. These are cases that involve a glancing collision. Therefore, it is next assumed that there must be some minimum relative velocity along the centerline between the molecules if a collision is going to lead to reaction. Collisions which have at least this minimum velocity associated with them can be called reactive collisions, and their frequency can be represented by \\(Z_{AB}\\) (no prime). The frequency of collisions involving a velocity equal to or greater than some minimum, \\(u_0\\), can be found by replacing the lower limit of the integral above with \\(u_0\\), leading to Equation E.11 for \\(Z_{AB}\\), where \\(\\epsilon_0\\) is the energy corresponding to the relative velocity, \\(u_0\\).\n\\[\nZ_{AB}=N_A^*N_B^*\\sigma _{AB}\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\epsilon_0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{E.11}\\]\nAn analysis similar to the one just presented can be done for collisions between two A molecules. The primary difference is that one must be careful not to double-count the collisions. The resulting expression for the reactive collision frequency, \\(Z_{AA}\\), is given in Equation E.12. The analysis of a collision between three molecules, A, B, and C, requires a slight modification. The probability that all three molecules are in contact simultaneously is extremely small. Therefore, a collision is considered to have occurred whenever the centers of all three molecules are within a distance \\(l\\) of each other. The resulting expression for the reactive three-body collision frequency, \\(Z_{ABC}\\), is given in Equation E.13.\n\\[\nZ_{AA}=\\left(N_A^*\\right)\\sigma _{AA}\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\epsilon_0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{E.12}\\]\n\\[\nZ_{ABC}=8N_A^*N_B^*N_C^*\\sigma _{AB}\\sigma _{BC}l\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi}}\\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_{AB}} -\\frac{1}{\\mu_{BC}} \\right)\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\epsilon_0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{E.13}\\]\nTo this point, all the equations have been developed on the basis of molecules. Through the use of Avogadro’s number, \\(N_{Av}\\), each quantity appearing in the equations above can be converted to molar units.\n\\[\n\\epsilon_0 = \\frac{E}{N_{Av}}\n\\]\n\\[\nk_B = \\frac{R}{N_{Av}}\n\\]\n\\[\nN_i^*= N_{Av}C_i\n\\]\n\\[\nZ_{AB}= N_{Av}r_{j,f}\n\\]\nSubstituting into Equations E.11, E.12 and E.13 gives Equations E.14, E.15 and E.16 for the generalized forward rates of bimolecular A-B reactions, bimolecular A-A reactions, and termolecular A-B-C reactions, respectively. It should be noted that these expressions only give the rate of the reaction in the forward direction, as indicated by the \\(f\\) appended to the subscript on the rate, \\(r\\).\n\\[\nr_{AB,f}=N_{Av}\\sigma _{AB}C_AC_B\\sqrt{\\frac{8k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}\n\\tag{E.14}\\]\n\\[\nr_{AA,f}=N_{Av}\\sigma _{AA}C_A^2\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi \\mu}}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}\n\\tag{E.15}\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_{ABC,f} &= 8N_{Av}\\sigma _{AB}\\sigma _{BC}IC_AC_BC_C\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_BT}{\\pi}} \\\\\n& \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_{AB}} -\\frac{1}{\\mu_{BC}} \\right)\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_j}{RT}\\right)}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{E.16}\\]\nReal molecules are not spheres. For an asymmetrical molecule, it may be necessary for the collision to take place in one part of the molecule in order to have reaction take place. If the colliding molecules are not oriented properly, necessary bonds can’t form and reaction can’t occur. The collision theory does not account for this kind of steric (geometric) limitation. If a reaction does have steric limitations, a constant is introduced into the rate expressions above. This constant, called a steric factor, is equal to the fraction of the collisions that have the orientation necessary for reaction to take place.\nIf the constants in the rate expressions above are unknown, they can be treated as adjustable parameters that are used to fit the rate expression to experimental data. In order to do so, groups of constants in the expressions above must be lumped together into single constants. Doing results in a single collision theory rate expression for the forward rate of an elementary reaction, Equation E.17, irrespective of whether it is a bimolecular A-B reaction, a bimolecular A-A reaction or a termolecular A-B-C reaction. Note that the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants in that equation, \\(\\nu_{i,j}\\), are negative numbers so the resulting exponents on the concentrations are positive.\n\\[\nr_{j,f} = k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_u,j}}\n\\tag{E.17}\\]\nGenerally the net rate of reaction is more useful than the rate in the forward direction only. It is straightforward to generate an expression for the net rate of reaction. The definition of forward and reverse is completely arbitrary, so Equation E.17 can be used to generate an expression for the rate in the reverse direction, too.\n\\[\nr_{j,r} = k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\tag{E.18}\\]\nWhen the reaction reaches thermodynamic equilibrium, its net rate will equal zero, and as a consequence, the rate in the forward direction will equal the rate in the reverse direction. Thus, the two uni-directional rates can be set equal to each other while simultaneously recognizing that this is true only when the concentrations are equal to the equilibrium concentrations. Rearrangement of the resulting equation reveals that the ratio of the forward to the reverse rate coefficients must equal the concentration equilibrium constant for the elementary reaction, Equation E.19.\n\\[\nr_{j,f}\\Bigr\\rvert_\\text{equilibrium} = r_{j,r}\\Bigr\\rvert_\\text{equilibrium}\n\\]\n\\[\nk_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}} =k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p,eq}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}}{k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}} = \\prod_i C_{i,eq}^{\\nu_{i,j}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}}{k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}} = K_{j,eq_c}\n\\tag{E.19}\\]\nAn expression for the net rate of reaction according to collision theory is found by taking the difference between the forward and reverse rates. This can be written using the reverse rate coefficient, as in Equation E.20 or using the equilibrium constant, as in Equation E.21. The two forms are equivalent.\n\\[\nr_j = r_{j,f} - r_{j,r}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nr_j &= k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}} \\\\&- k_{0,j,r}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,r}}{RT}\\right)}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{E.20}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_{0,j,f}\\sqrt{T}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-E_{j,f}}{RT}\\right)}\\left(\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\displaystyle \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,j}}}{K_{j,eq_c}}\\right)\n\\tag{E.21}\\]\nIt is often convenient to use partial pressures as the composition variables in a gas phase reaction system. Equations E.20 and E.21 can be easily converted so that partial pressures replace the concentrations. Since Equations E.20 and E.21 were derived assuming ideal gas type behavior, the concentrations and partial pressures are simply related via the ideal gas law, Equation E.22. Substitution of Equation E.22 into Equation E.20 or E.21 leads, in a straightforward manner, to a rate expression in terms of partial pressures instead of concentrations.\n\\[\nC_i=\\frac{n_i}{V}=\\frac{P_i}{RT}\n\\tag{E.22}\\]"

    "text": "E.4 Limitations of Collision Theory\nCollision theory as presented here is sometimes referred to as simple collision theory. It offers a simple molecular view of how reactions take place, and it can be useful for making rough approximations of the values of pre-exponential factors. There are several shortcomings of simple collision theory. First, the point-mass assumption is very limiting; it ignores internal motions within molecules and the energy associated with those internal motions. A second shortcoming is the absence of attractive and repulsive forces between molecules. In a real system, a molecule that is passing close to a second molecule may be attracted by it, causing it to travel in a curved path and collide with that molecule instead of continuing past it on a straight line path. Another shortcoming is the absence of orientation requirements for reaction to occur. Simple collision theory does not offer an easy way to estimate the activation energy, and it strictly applies only to gas phase reactions. There are also reactions for which the observed rate is higher than that predicted by the collision theory, and this can’t be explained by steric effects because they should lower the reaction rate, not raise it. There are more advanced formulations of collision theory that address the shortcomings enumerated here. Since these advanced formulations use more accurate representations of the molecules, they are often referred to as molecular reaction dynamics models."

    "section": "F.1 Potential Energy Surface for a Reaction",
    "text": "F.1 Potential Energy Surface for a Reaction\nThere are several ways to develop the transition state theory. Some use classical thermodynamics and some use statistical mechanics. Here the theory will be developed in the context of the hypothetical reaction between an AB molecule and a C atom, Equation F.1.\n\\[\nAB + C \\rightarrow A + BC\n\\tag{F.1}\\]\nThere are three atoms involved in reaction F.1. Consider a system in space consisting of these three atoms. Each of the atoms may be located anywhere within the system. The arrangement of these three atoms in space can be specified using nine coordinates, namely the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) coordinates of each atom’s center. Quantum chemistry could be used to calculate the energy, \\(\\Phi\\), of the system for all possible combinations of these nine coordinates. The energy could then be plotted as a function of the nine coordinates yielding a ten-dimensional potential energy surface.\nMost people can’t visualize a ten dimensional surface. Therefore consider an approximate three dimensional system where the centers of mass of all three atoms are constrained to lie on a common straight line, where the C atom is fixed at the origin, and where the C atom is not between the other two atoms. As shown in Figure F.1, the geometry of this simplified system can be completely defined by two coordinates: the distance between the centers of the A and B atoms, \\(D_{AB}\\), and the distance between the centers of the B and C atoms, \\(D_{BC}\\). The energy for this simplified system can be represented as a three-dimensional surface.\n\n\n\nFigure F.1: Constrained three atom system where all atoms lie on a common straight line.\n\n\nFigure F.2 is an example of how this potential energy surface might appear. It can be seen that there are valleys or wells on the surface. (The same would be true of the ten-dimensional potential surface originally considered.) Wells that are relatively deep represent geometric arrangements where stable compounds have formed. Figure F.2 indicates two such wells. For one well in Figure F.2 the \\(D_{AB}\\) distance is small and constant whereas the \\(D_{BC}\\) distance can take on any large value. This well corresponds to the existence of an AB molecule and a separate C atom. The other well in Figure F.2 corresponds to the existence of a BC molecule and a separate A atom; \\(D_{BC}\\) is small and constant (equal to the bond length), and \\(D_{AB}\\) can take on any large value.\n\n\n\nFigure F.2: A schematic representation of a potential energy surface for the reaction given in Equation F.1.\n\n\nFigure F.2 also shows a path (a-b-c-d-e) between the two potential wells. This path crosses over the smallest barrier separating the two wells. For the reaction as written in Equation F.1, the starting point, a, is the well corresponding to an AB molecule and a separate C atom. Assume the reaction takes place with the three atoms constrained to remain collinear, with the C atom fixed at the origin, and with the C atom not between the other two atoms. Then as the reaction takes place the system traces out the path a-b-c-d-e shown in Figure F.2. The difference in energy between the bottom of the well where the system started (point a) and the highest point on the path (point c) is the activation energy for the reaction. Notice that as the system passes over the barrier, \\(D_{AB}\\) increases (the AB bond breaks) and \\(D_{BC}\\) begins to approach the normal BC bond length.\nThus, if it is assumed that the lowest energy path is followed, the potential surface can be used to determine that path. Each point on the path completely specifies the orientation of the entire system. Once this path has been determined, the potential energy diagram can be reduced from however many dimensions it originally had to a two dimensional plot. The abscissa of the plot is the distance along the path that has been determined from the full potential surface, and the ordinate is the potential energy of the system at that distance along the path. The distance along the identified path is often referred to as the reaction coordinate. Figure F.3 shows this kind of two-dimensional potential energy diagram. The diagram in Figure F.3 corresponds to Figure F.2; the points a through e on the two diagrams also correspond.\nThe state of the system when it is at the highest point in Figure F.3 is known as the transition state. Recall that each point on the path corresponds to a specific arrangement of the atoms. At the top of the activation barrier (i. e. in the transition state) all the atoms are in close proximity. The distances \\(D_{AB}\\) and \\(D_{BC}\\) are different than they would be in either stable molecule. The species formed from the three atoms when they are in the orientation corresponding to the transition state is called the activated complex. The activated complex is neither reactants nor products; it is a hybrid of the two. To recap, the entity at the top of the activation barrier is called the activated complex and it is said to be in the transition state.\n\n\n\nFigure F.3: A two dimensional representation of the potential energy along the reaction coordinate. Points a through e correspond their counterparts in Figure F.2.\n\n\nThe activated complex is not a stable chemical species. It is a species in transition, and its lifetime is exceedingly short. Nonetheless, in transition state theory, it is assumed that the activated complex can be treated like a stable chemical species. Specifically, it is assumed that the activated complex can be assigned thermodynamic properties like any stable species. These thermodynamic properties can be estimated using the same techniques that are used to estimate the thermodynamic properties of stable species.\nThe most important assumption of transition state theory is that the reactants are in a special kind of equilibrium with those activated complexes that are in the process of transforming from reactants into products. (The reactants are only in equilibrium with those activated complexes that are in the process of becoming products and not with those that are in the process of becoming reactants.) One consequence of this is that the theory will only apply when the reactant molecules are present in a Boltzmann distribution. If the reaction process is so fast that the distribution of reactant molecules deviates from the Boltzmann distribution, the transition state theory cannot be used. Fortunately this situation is infrequently encountered.\nThe rationale for assuming that “forward moving” activated complexes are in equilibrium with the reactants begins by considering the situation where the chemical reaction has reached thermodynamic equilibrium. At this point the net rate of reaction equals zero, but there is still a significant absolute rate in the forward direction and an equal absolute rate in the reverse direction. Thus, at overall equilibrium the reactants are in equilibrium with the forward moving activated complexes, the products are in equilibrium with the “backward moving” activated complexes, and the number of forward moving activated complexes must just equal the number of backward moving activated complexes. Now suppose that by some unspecified means, all product molecules are instantaneously removed, and thereby the overall reaction is no longer at equilibrium. Since the products have all been removed, the absolute rate in the reverse direction will be zero, but there is no reason why the number of forward moving activated complexes should change. This thought experiment justifies the assumption that the reactants are always in a special kind of equilibrium with those activated complexes which are in the process of becoming products. If this was not true, then the rate coefficient would change as the reaction approached equilibrium. Such a change in the rate coefficient has not been observed experimentally.\nReturning to Figure F.3, the absolute rate of reaction in the forward direction is seen to be equal to the number of times activated complexes pass over the potential barrier from the reactant well to the product well. This, in turn, depends upon two factors: how many forward-moving activated complexes are present at a given time, and how fast do they proceed along the reaction coordinate. The first factor is determined using the assumptions just described. It is assumed that the reactants are in equilibrium with those activated complexes in the process of moving across the potential barrier in the forward direction. For the reaction as written in Equation F.2, this can be expressed using an equilibrium constant as shown in equation Equation F.3. The latter equation can be rearranged to give an expression for the concentration of the activated complexes, Equation F.4. In Equations F.3 and F.4 \\(C_i\\) denotes molar concentration of \\(i\\), \\(K^\\ddagger\\) is a concentration-based equilibrium constant for reaction F.2, and the superscripted symbol, \\(\\ddagger\\), is used to denote that a given quantity is associated with a forward moving activated complex which is proceeding along the reaction coordinate.\n\\[\nAB + C \\rightleftarrows ABC^\\ddagger\n\\tag{F.2}\\]\n\\[\nK^\\ddagger = \\frac{C_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}}{C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}}\n\\tag{F.3}\\]\n\\[\nC_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = K^\\ddagger C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\n\\tag{F.4}\\]\nEquation F.4 gives the number of moles of activated complexes in a unit volume. All that remains is to determine how rapidly each of these complexes travels along the reaction coordinate. In principle it would be possible to determine how rapidly the activated complex moves along the reaction coordinate using the original Cartesian coordinate system. Thus, progress along the reaction coordinate could be expressed in terms of the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) components of velocity of each of the three atoms in the activated complex. This would be very cumbersome because motion along the reaction coordinate involves simultaneous changes of all nine of the coordinates.\nIt is easier (and customary) to use a different set of coordinates to describe the motion along the reaction coordinate. This does not change the potential surface in any way, it just changes the ease with which motion upon it can be described. (It is possible to describe a sphere using rectangular, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates. The sphere is the same in all three cases, but the equations describing it are much simpler if spherical coordinates are used). Motion of the atoms making up the \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) activated complex as it moves along the reaction coordinate can then be described in terms of the following nine coordinates. Three coordinates correspond translational motion of the center of mass of the activated complex as a whole; one coordinate in each of the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) directions. For non-linear activated complexes, three additional coordinates describe the rotational motion of the whole complex about axes parallel to the \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) directions. (If the activated complex is linear, only two coordinates are used; one each to describe the rotational motion about the two axes perpendicular to the centerline of the complex itself.) The remaining coordinates correspond to different vibrations within the activated complex. In general, if there are \\(N\\) atoms making up the activated complex the total number of coordinates is \\(3N\\). At first it may seem that little has been gained by changing coordinate systems. However, it will be reasoned in what follows that as the activated complex approaches the top of the activation barrier, moving along the reaction coordinate becomes equivalent to changing just one vibrational mode. Hence the reaction coordinate becomes associated with a single coordinate of the system.\nConsider now the equilibrium constant, \\(K^\\ddagger\\), in Equation F.4. Since it has been assumed that the activated complex can be treated as a stable species, this equilibrium constant can be analyzed from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics. For an ideal gas the equilibrium constant in terms of molar concentrations is given by Equation F.5.\n\\[\nK^\\ddagger = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}}{q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}} \\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_0^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.5}\\]\nIn Equation F.5, \\(K^\\ddagger\\) is the equilibrium constant for reaction F.2 in terms of molar concentrations, \\(q_i\\) is the molecular partition function (omitting the electronic contribution) per unit volume for species \\(i\\), \\(-\\Delta E_0^0\\) is the change in ground state electronic energy of the system when reaction F.2 takes place stoichiometrically at the absolute zero of temperature, \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant, \\(T\\) is the temperature, and a superscripted \\(\\ddagger\\) is used to denote that a particular quantity involves a forward moving activated complex. (Note: Equation F.5 assumes that essentially all species are in their electronic ground state during reaction.)\nAccording to statistical mechanics, the energy available to a system is distributed, or partitioned, among the different possible states of the system. The partition function, \\(q_i\\), is a measure of the availability of these states per unit volume. The partition function is made up of component terms for each different type of state available to the system, e. g. as given in Equation F.6, where \\(q_{tr,i}\\) is the partition function for the translational states of species \\(i\\), \\(q_{rot,i}\\) is the rotational partition function and \\(q_{vib,i}\\) is the vibrational partition function.\n\\[\nq_i = q_{tr,i}q_{rot,i}q_{vib,i}\n\\tag{F.6}\\]\nEach type of state may have more than one degree of freedom. For example, if \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) is a linear complex it will have three degrees of translational freedom, two degrees of rotational freedom, and four degrees of vibrational freedom. The partition functions for a certain type of motion can be broken down into terms for each of the available degrees of freedom. If \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) is a linear complex, then its vibrational partition function can be broken into four component terms as indicated in Equation F.7. In Equation F.7 the terms \\(q_{v_1,i}\\), \\(q_{v_2,i}\\), \\(q_{v_3,i}\\), and \\(q_{v_4,i}\\) are vibrational partition functions for each of the (in this case, four) vibrational degree of freedom of species \\(i\\). Equation F.8 is used to calculate the value of the partition function for any one particular vibrational degree of freedom of species \\(i\\). In Equation F.8 \\(\\nu _n\\) is the characteristic vibrational frequency associated with the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) degree of vibrational freedom and \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant.\n\\[\nq_{vib,i}=q_{n_{v_1},i}q_{n_{v_2},i}q_{n_{v_3},i}q_{n_{v_4},i}\n\\tag{F.7}\\]\n\\[\nq_{n_v,i} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-h\\nu_{n_v}}{k_BT} \\right)}}\n\\tag{F.8}\\]\nUsing Equations F.6, F.7 and F.8 the partition function for the activated complex can be expanded as in Equation F.9, where \\(N_{vib}\\) is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for the \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) activated complex.\n\\[\nq_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = q_{tr,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}q_{rot,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\left(\\prod_{n_v}  q_{v_n,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\right)\n\\tag{F.9}\\]\nIn an activated complex there are bonds which are in the process of breaking and/or forming. One way to view such a process is as a stretching/compressing vibration along the bond(s) in question. Referring back to Figure F.1, one can imagine a kind of vibration where the central B atom moves back and forth horizontally while A and C remain relatively motionless. Clearly, at one end of this particular vibrational mode, the system would look more like AB + C, while at the other end of this mode it would look like A + BC. In other words, one half-cycle of this asymmetric stretching mode can easily be visualized as leading to the formation of a BC bond and the breaking of an AB bond. With this view, motion along the reaction coordinate in the vicinity of the transition state becomes equivalent to this one vibration. For present purposes this vibrational mode will be called the critical mode and its frequency will be denoted as \\(\\nu _c\\).\nSince the bond(s) in question are not completely formed and/or broken in the activated complex, they are expected to be quite weak. The vibrational frequency of a weak bond is low, and this allows the partition function of this one vibrational mode to be approximated using Equation F.10. The partition function for this one weak bond can then be factored out of the total partition function for the \\(\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger\\) activated complex, Equation F.9, resulting in Equation F.11.\n\\[\n\\displaystyle\\lim_{\\nu_c\\to 0} \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp{\\left( \\frac{-h\\nu_c}{k_BT} \\right)}} = \\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}\n\\tag{F.10}\\]\n\\[\nq_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = q_{tr,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}q_{rot,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\left(\\prod_{n_v^\\prime}  q_{{n_v^\\prime},\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\right)\\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}\n\\tag{F.11}\\]\nNotice particularly that the continuous product in Equation F.11 excludes the partition function that was factored out. In addition, the approximation given in Equation F.10 has been used for the partition function of the critical vibration. The part of the total partition function which remains after factoring out the term for the critical vibration is often denoted by the symbol \\(q_{\\ddagger}\\), where the subscripted \\(\\ddagger\\) denotes that one term has been factored out. This notation is formalized in Equation F.12.\n\\[\nq_{\\ddagger} = \\frac{q_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}}{\\left(\\frac{-h\\nu_c}{k_BT}\\right)}=q_{tr,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}q_{rot,\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\left(\\prod_{n_v^\\prime}  q_{{n_v^\\prime},\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger}\\right)\n\\tag{F.12}\\]\nRearranging Equation F.12 gives Equation F.13, which can be substituted into Equation F.5 giving Equation F.14. After rearrangement, an expression for the critical vibrational frequency results, Equation F.15.\n\\[\nq_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} = q_{\\ddagger}\\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}\n\\tag{F.13}\\]\n\\[\nK^\\ddagger = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}\\frac{k_BT}{h\\nu_c}}{q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}} \\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_0^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.14}\\]\n\\[\n\\nu_c = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{K^\\ddagger q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_0^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.15}\\]\nThe final assumption needed to complete the analysis is that the frequency of the critical vibration will in fact equal the frequency at which the activated complexes are transformed into products. The assumption is that the first time the activated complex attempts to go through the asymmetric stretching vibration just described, the AB bond will break and the BC bond will form. As mentioned previously, the rate of the elementary reaction F.2 will be equal to the product of the concentration of forward-moving activated complexes and the frequency at which they decompose. This is expressed in Equation F.16, which makes use of this final assumption.\n\\[\nr_{j,f}=C_{\\text{ABC}^\\ddagger} \\nu_c\n\\tag{F.16}\\]\nEquations F.4 and F.15 give expressions for the two terms on the right-hand side of Equation F.16. These can be substituted into Equation F.16 leading to Equation F.17 for the forward rate of the elementary reaction F.1. Equation F.17 has the form shown in Equation F.18, where the rate coefficient is given by Equation F.19 and the pre-exponential by Equation F.20. In contrast to the Arrhenius equation, the transition state theory pre-exponential factor is not constant. Temperature appears explicitly as well as in the total partition functions.\n\\[\nr_{j,f}= \\left(K^\\ddagger C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\\right)\\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{K^\\ddagger q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_{j,f}= \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{ q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\n\\tag{F.17}\\]\n\\[\nr_{j,f}=k_{j,f}C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}}\n\\tag{F.18}\\]\n\\[\nk_{j,f} = k_{0,j,f}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}\n\\tag{F.19}\\]\n\\[\nk_{0,j,f} = \\frac{N_{Av}q_{\\ddagger}}{ q_{\\text{AB}}q_{\\text{C}}}\\frac{k_BT}{h}\n\\tag{F.20}\\]\nAn analogous process can be used to generate an expression for the rate in the reverse direction, Equation F.21. The net rate of reaction then is simply the difference between the forward and reverse rates, Equation F.22. That expression can be generalized to other stoichiometries as shown in Equation F.23.\n\\[\nr_{j,r}= k_{0,j,r}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,r}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{A}}C_{\\text{BC}}\n\\tag{F.21}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_{0,j,f}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,f}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{AB}}C_{\\text{C}} - k_{0,j,r}\\exp{\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta E_{0,r}^0}{k_BT}\\right)}C_{\\text{A}}C_{\\text{BC}}\n\\tag{F.22}\\]\n\\[\nr_j = k_{j,f}\\prod_{i_r} C_{i_r}^{-\\nu_{i_r,j}} - k_{j,r}\\prod_{i_p} C_{i_p}^{\\nu_{i_p,j}}\n\\tag{F.23}\\]\nAppendix E showed that the forward and reverse rate coefficients are related to the equilibrium constant, and that as a consequence, the net rate can be written in terms of the forward rate coefficient and the equilibrium constant. That appendix also showed how the ideal gas constant can be used to write the net rate expression in terms of partial pressures instead of concentrations. Both of those things apply to the net rate expression from transition state theory."

    "text": "F.2 Shortcomings of Simple Transition State Theory\nThis simple formulation of transition state theory does have some shortcomings. It ignores the possibility of quantum mechanical tunneling through the barrier. Tunneling does not affect the rate coefficient for the vast majority of chemical reactions; it is most important when light elements are involved. A transmission coefficient can be added to account for tunneling in a manner similar to the way the steric factor accounts for orientation effects in simple collision theory.\nThe assumption that all modes remain in thermodynamic equilibrium is the source for another shortcoming. Reaction typically takes place within 10-12 s, and that is often not enough time for all modes of motion to reach equilibrium; the treatment given here ignores the dynamics of moving energy into the forming bond and into the leaving entity.\nA third shortcoming of simple transition state theory is that it assumes all reaction events pass through the saddle point. That is, it assumes the reaction coordinate for every reaction event passes over the lowest barrier separating the two wells in Figure F.2. Experimental and computational studies indicate that many times, the reacting molecules follow a reaction coordinate that passes over the barrier at a location other than the saddle point."

This can be accomplished by noting that the number of moles is equal to the product of the volume and the concentration, \\(n_i = C_iV\\).

As a consequence, it becomes necessary to write the mole and energy balance equations on a differential element of reactor volume and then take the limit as the size of this element goes to zero. With the assumption of perfect mixing in the radial direction, in the limit where its thickness goes to zero, the volume element is perfectly mixed. Here, we will assume that the reactor is cylindrical with a constant diameter, D, and a length, L, as shown in Figure G.1 which additionally shows a differentially thick cross section that will be used in formulating the mole and energy balances.\n\n\n\nFigure G.1: Differential PFR Element\n\n\n\nG.4.1 The PFR Mole Balance\nThe system being modeled is the fluid within the differential volume element of axial thickness, \\(dz\\), and diameter, \\(D\\), at any instant in time.

In this appendix, the term “solver” is used to refer to the computer program or function that numerically solves a set of ATEs. There are many different ATE solvers available, and each has specific instructions on how to use it. This appendix makes no attempt to explain the details of using any of the available equation solvers.\nNo matter which solver is used, there are two things that must be provided to it. The first is a guess for the solution. In the case of Equations H.7, H.8 and H.9 the guess would consist of a value for \\(u_1\\), a value for \\(u_2\\) and a value for \\(u_3\\). The other thing that must be provided to the solver is a means of calculating the value of each of the residuals, given values for the unknowns. Typically this is done by providing the name of a function or subroutine to the solver. That subroutine receives values of the unknowns as arguments. It then evaluates the residuals, e. g. \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\) and \\(f_3\\) in Equations H.7, H.8 and H.9, and returns their values."

    "text": "H.4 A Simplistic Explanation of How the ATEs are Solved\nIt should be noted that the solver can solve a set of linear equations exactly, or at least to within the roundoff error of the computer, easily and rapidly. When ATEs are solved numerically, the solution is not exact, but it is “very close” to the actual solution. See the following section on convergence for a more complete explanation of what is meant by “very close.”\nThe description of numerical solution of ATEs presented here is overly simplistic. It is intended to provide a sense of how the solver works. The solver begins by approximating the residuals as linear functions that pass through the point provided to it as a guess. It then solves the linear approximation to obtain an improved guess. The values of the residuals are calculated using the improved guess and checked to see whether they are “very close” to zero. If so, the improved guess is the solution to the ATEs. The solver returns the improved guess as the solution and quits. If the residuals are not “very close” to zero, the entire process is repeated starting with the improved guess. This continues until a solution is found or until the solver determines it is not able to find a solution (see the following sections on convergence and cautions)."

    "text": "H.5 Convergence\nAs explained in the preceding section, the numerical solution of a set of ATEs is an iterative process. In each iteration the values of the residuals are calculated and checked to determine whether they are “very close” to zero. Ideally, the values of the residuals should get closer and closer to zero with each iteration. This is called convergence to the solution. Sometimes the solver is unable to converge to the point where the residuals are “very close” to zero. In this situation, the solver eventually has to quit without finding the solution (hopefully warning the user of this fact). Most solvers have several criteria that they use to determine when to stop iterating. Common convergence criteria include the following:\n\nthe residuals are smaller than a specified amount (a solution has been found).\na specified number of iterations has occurred (a solution was not found).\nthe residuals have been evaluated a specified number of times (a solution was not found).\nthe values of the residuals are getting farther from zero instead of closer (a solution was not found).\nthe values of the residuals are changing by less than a specified amount between iterations (a solution was not found).\nthe improved guess is changing by less than a specified amount between iterations (a solution was not found).\n\nEach “specified amount” in these criteria typically has a default value that can can be over-ridden when the solver is started."

Assuming there are no errors in the function that calculates the values of the residuals, when this happens, it is often because the guess provided to the solver wasn’t close enough to the solution. Another reason might be a singularity in the residuals, as written. If the solver does not converge there are a few things that can be tried.\n\nRestart the solver using a different guess.\nRewrite the residuals so that there are no denominators that contain an unknown. This can be done multiplying both sides of the residual by each denominator that contains an unknown.\n\nNonlinear equations can have more than one solution. For example, a quadratic polynomial has two solutions. Most solvers will only locate one solution. To find other solutions, the solver should be re-started using a different guess."

    "text": "I.3 Preparing the IVODEs for Solution.\nIt has already been noted that the number of IVODEs must equal the number of dependent variables and there must be only one independent variable. So the first step in preparing to solve the equations is to verify that this condition is satisfied. Doing so identifies the \\(N\\) IVODEs being solved and the \\(N\\) dependent variables whose values will be found over a range of values of the independent variable. Using Equations I.4, I.5, I.6, and I.7 as an example, there are 4 IVODEs, 4 dependent variables (\\(\\dot n_A\\), \\(\\dot n_Z\\), \\(\\dot V\\), and \\(T\\)) and 1 independent variable, \\(t\\).\nThe next step in preparing to solve the IVODEs is to express every other quantity appearing in the equations in terms of known constants, the independent variable, and the \\(N\\) dependent variables. In the present example, that means that \\(V\\), \\(\\dot V\\), \\(\\dot n_{A,in}\\), \\(r\\), \\(\\dot n_{Z,in}\\), \\(R\\), \\(P\\), \\(\\hat{C}_{p,A}\\), \\(\\hat{C}_{p,Z}\\) \\(T_{in}\\), and \\(\\Delta H\\) must be expressed in terms of known constants, \\(t\\), \\(\\dot n_A\\), \\(\\dot n_Z\\), \\(\\dot V\\), and \\(T\\).\nRecall that the numerical solution of IVODEs spans a finite range of values of each variable. For each variable, that range begins at its intial value. The third step in preparing to solve the IVODEs is to specify the “initial value” of the independent variable and the corresponding initial values of the dependent variables. In the example being used here, this might entail defining \\(t=0\\) as the initial value of the independent variables and then listing the corresponding values of \\(\\dot n_A\\), \\(\\dot n_Z\\), \\(\\dot V\\), and \\(T\\) at \\(t=0\\).\nThe last step in praparing to solve the IVODEs is to specify the other end of the range over which the equations will be solved. This is sometimes referred to as providing a stopping criterion (also known as the final value or the ending value). (The reason for calling it the “stopping criterion” should be apparent after reading the description, below, of how the IVODEs are solved.) The stopping criterion can be defined explicitly, by setting the value of the independent variable, or implicitly, by setting the value of one of the dependent variables at the end of the range over which the equations will be solved. In the present example an explicit stopping criterion might be that the equations will be solved in the range from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=30 \\text{ min}\\). An implicit stopping criterion might be that the equations will be solved in the range from \\(t=0\\) to the time when \\(n_A = 0.05n_{A,in}\\) (i. e. the time when the conversion reaches 95%)."

This appendix makes no attempt to explain the details of using any of the available solvers.\nHowever, no matter which specific solver one uses, there are three things that must be provided to the solver. The first of these are the initial values as described in the preceding section. The second thing that must be provided to the solver is the stopping criterion as described above.

    "text": "I.5 An Oversimplified Description of How the IVODEs are Solved\nThe description presented here of how the solver works is overly simplified, but hopefully it provides sense of how the solution is generated. At the start, the solver has a set of values of the dependent variables at a known value of the independent variable, i. e. it has the initial values. This is illustrated graphically in part (a) of Figure I.1 for any one of the dependent variables.\n\n\n\nFigure I.1: Graphical Representation of an IVODE Integration Step. (a) The initial value. (b) Using the slope to approximate y(x). (c) Incrementally increasing x and approximating the corresponding y.\n\n\nIt isn’t possible to plot \\(y\\) vs. \\(x\\) at that point because \\(y\\left(x\\right)\\) is not known. (Indeed, \\(y\\left(x\\right)\\) is the solution to the IVODE.) Instead, the solver calculates the values of the derivatives of the dependent variables at that initial point, represented in the figure as the point at \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\). The derivative, \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) at that point is the slope of the unknown function, \\(y\\left(x\\right)\\). This is shown graphically in part (b) of Figure I.1.\nStarting from the known point, \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\), the solver increases \\(x\\) by a small amount, \\(\\Delta x\\), which is known as the step-size. It then calculates the corresponding change in \\(y\\), \\(\\Delta y\\), using the slope. The resulting point, \\(\\left(x_1,y_1\\right)\\), is shown in part (c) of Figure I.1. This process is sometimes referred to as taking an integration step. Effectively, the solver uses the small straight line seqment between \\(\\left(x_0,y_0\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(x_1,y_1\\right)\\) to approximate the true solution, \\(y\\left(x\\right)\\), in that interval. The accuracy of this approximation increases as \\(\\Delta x\\) decreases, so typically the solver uses a large number of very small steps.\nOnce the step has been completed and the value of every dependent variable is known at \\(x=x_1\\) , the solver checks to determine whether making that step resulted in the stopping criterion being satisfied. In other words, if the stopping criterion is that \\(y_3\\) should equal some value, \\(y_{3,f}\\), the solver would check to see whether \\(y_3\\) did, in fact, reach or surpass \\(y_{3,f}\\) after making the step. If so, the numerical solution is complete and the solver returns the values of the dependent variables and the independent variable for each of the steps it took. If the stopping criterion has not been satisfied after taking a step, another step is taken, this time starting from the point \\(\\left(x_1,y_1\\right)\\)."

    "text": "I.6 Cautions Related to Numerical Solutions\nWhen the stopping criterion is a value of one of the dependent variables, many solvers require that you provide both a final value of the independent variable and a final value of that dependent variable. The solver then takes steps as described above, and after each step it checks to see whether the dependent variable has reached the value you specified. The problem is that if you specify a final value of the independent variable that is too small, the solver may reach that value first and stop. The stopping criterion you specified for the dependent variable will not have been reached, and the result that is returned is not the result you are seeking. Therefore it is important to check that the dependent variable reached the stopping criterion you specified.\nTo avoid having the solver stop because it reached the stopping criterion for the independent variable, it is common to specify a very large final value for the independent variable stopping criterion. The problem with doing this is that it may cause the solver to use a step size that is too large, and that may result in an inaccurate solution. Therefore, it is important to check that the step size was not too large. The solution that is returned will include the final value of the independent variable. The stopping criterion for the independent variable can be set to a value slightly larger than that and the equations can be solved a second time. Assuming the second solution reaches the desired stopping criterion for the dependent variable, the second solution can then be taken as the desired result.\nA second possible problem arises when solving sets of IVODEs where one of the dependent variables changes very abruptly over a very small range of the independent variable, and the changes in that dependent variable significantly affect the changes in the other dependent variables over a much larger range of the independent variable. Equations like this are called stiff ODEs, and they require special treatment of the step size. Therefore, when solving sets of ODEs, one should pay attention to whether any of the dependent variables change very abruptly as the independent variable changes. If they do, it is advisable to repeat the solution using a solver that is specifically tailored to stiff ODEs."

    "section": "J.1 Defining the Problem",
    "text": "J.1 Defining the Problem\nParameter estimation requires experimental data. In each experiment, the person performing the experiments sets the values of one or more quantities. Herein, the variables used to represent those quantities are referred to as the adjusted input variables. After setting those values, the experimenter then records the values of other quantities. The variables used to represent these other quantities are referred to as the experimental responses. In Reaction Engineering Basics only experiments with a single experimental response are considered. Every experiment performed involves the same set of adjusted input variables and the same experimental response, but their values are different from experiment to experiment.\nOften, the reason someone performs experiments like these is because they believe that the response depends upon the values of the adjusted input variables. Based upon that belief, they propose a mathematical response model. The values of the adjusted input variables from any one experiment can be substituted into the response model permitting the calculation of a model-predicted response for that experiment. Typically the response model contains one or more unknown constants, called the model parameters.\nIt is important to understand that even if the model is correct and the values of the model parameters are known exactly, the model-predicted response for any one experiment will not be exactly equal to the experimental response. Measured values, such as the experimental response, always include random error. Put differently, if the same experiment was performed 10 times, 10 slightly different experimental responses could be recorded. Given a response model (including the values of the parameters appearing in it), the difference between the experimental response and the model-predicted response for any one experiment is called the error or the residual for that one experiment.\nReturning to the reason the experiments were performed, the person who performed them believes that the response depends upon the values of the adjusted input variables. However, they do not know what the correct response model is. Therefore, when they propose a response model, they don’t know whether the proposed model is correct and they don’t know the values of the parameters that the proposed model contains. The purposes of parameter estimation are first, to calculate the “best” values of the parameters in the proposed model, second, to estimate the uncertainty in each parameter value, and third, to provide some measure of how accurately the model predicts the experimental responses.\nThis raises the question of how to define the “best” values of the model parameters. If the error (i. e. the difference between the experimental response and the model-predicted response) for each experiment is squared and then the resulting squares of the errors are added together, the most common definition for the “best” parameter values is that the sum of the squares of the errors is minimized when the “best” values of the parameters are used in the response model. The squares of the errors are used instead of the errors themselves so that positive and negative errors don’t cancel each other out. For this reason, parameter estimation is sometimes referred to as “least-squares fitting.” An alternative definition of the “best” parameter values uses the sum of the squares of the relative errors. The use of this definition is considered in the final section of this appendix."

A “parity plot” can then be created wherein the model-predicted response is plotted versus the experimental response. If the model was perfect, every point in the parity plot would fall on a diagonal line passing through the origin.

The magnitude of the deviations from the horizontal axis is not important (the parity plot is used for this purpose).

    "section": "J.6 Cautions Related to Parameter Estimation",
    "text": "J.6 Cautions Related to Parameter Estimation\nA few issues should be kept in mind when performing numerical parameter estimation. The first is that the solver may converge to a local minimum of the sum of the squares of the errors and not the global minimum. This could result in a model that does not appear to be accurate, but that could be accurate if the global minimum was located. One way to try to detect this situation is to repeat the parameter estimation using a very different initial guess. If the solver converges to a different set of estimated parameters, that indicates that one (or possibly both) of the sets of estimated parameters corresponds to a local minimum. If a wide range of initial guesses always leads to the same parameter estimates, that may suggest the a global minimum has been found, and it is the model, itself, that is not accurate.\nThe second issue arises when initially guessing the value of a model parameter that might fall anywhere in a very wide range of values. As an example, in Reaction Engineering Basics problems, the pre-exponential factor for a rate coefficient could have a value anywhere between 10-20 and 1020. In this situation, if the initial guess is not sufficiently close to the actual value of the parameter, the solver may quit because it is not making progress. One way to reduce the likelihood of this happening is to use the base-10 logarithm of the parameter instead of the parameter itself. That is, if \\(k_0\\) is the actual parameter of interest in the model, re-write the model replacing \\(k_0\\) with \\(10^\\beta\\). Then perform parameter estimation to find the best value of \\(\\beta\\). When the possible range of \\(k_0\\) is between 10-20 and 1020, the corresponding range of \\(\\beta\\) is between -20 and 20. Once the best value \\(\\beta\\) has been found, the best value of \\(k_0\\) is simply calculated as \\(k_0 = 10^\\beta\\).\nThe third issue arises when the experimental responses span several orders of magnitude. In this situation, the errors associated with larger values of the response may be greater than errors associated with smaller values of the response. If that is so, the minimization process will focus on the responses with larger values because they have a greater effect upon the sum of the squares of the errors. One option for addressing this situation is to minimize the sum of the squares of the relative errors instead of the sum of the squares of the absolute errors."

There are many different BVODE solvers available, and each has specific instructions on how to use it. This appendix makes no attempt to explain the details of using any one of the available solvers.\nHowever, no matter which specific solver one uses, there are six things that must be provided to the solver. The first of two of these are the values of \\(x\\) at each end of the range where the BVODEs are valid. In terms of Equations K.4 through K.6 this means providing the values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In the example here, Equations K.1 through K.3, those values are 0 and \\(L\\).\nThe process for solving the BVODEs requires dividing the range of \\(x\\) between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into a number of small intervals. The third thing that must be supplied to the solver is the number of intervals to be used. Generally a larger number of intervals results in a more accurate answer, but increases the computation time.\nThe fourth thing that must be provided to the solver is a guess for the values of the dependent variables. The form in which this is provided might vary depending on the specific software being used. In the simplest case, the fourth item is simply a guess for the average value of \\(C_A\\) between \\(z=0\\) and \\(z=L\\) and a guess for the average value of \\(w\\) between \\(z=0\\) and \\(z=L\\). In a more demanding case, this might entail providing a guess for the values of \\(C_A\\) and \\(w\\) at the boundary of each of the intervals between \\(z=0\\) and \\(z=L\\).\nThe fifth thing that must be provided to the BVODE solver is a means of calculating the values of each of the first order derivatives, given values for the independent variable and the dependent variables. Quite commonly, this is done by providing the name of a function or subroutine to the solver. That subroutine receives values of the independent variable and the dependent variables as arguments. It then uses the expressions for the first-order ODEs being solved, Equations K.7 and K.8 in the present example, to calculate the values of the derivatives, \\(\\frac{dC_A}{dz}\\) and \\(\\frac{dw}{dz}\\), and returns them.\nThe final thing that must be provided to the BVODE solver is a means of evaluating the boundary conditions, i. e. a means of evaluating the residual functions, \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\), given values for the dependent variables, \\(y\\) and \\(w\\), at each of the boundaries, \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=b\\). Again, this is commonly done by providing the name of another function or subroutine to the solver. That subroutine receives \\(y \\Big\\rvert_{x=a}\\), \\(w \\Big\\rvert_{x=a}\\), \\(y \\Big\\rvert_{x=b}\\) and \\(w \\Big\\rvert_{x=b}\\) as arguments. It then calculates the values of \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) and returns them. In the present example, this second subroutine would receive \\(C_A \\Bigr\\rvert_{z=0}\\), \\(C_A \\Bigr\\rvert_{z=L}\\), \\(w\\Bigr\\rvert_{z=0}\\), and \\(w\\Bigr\\rvert_{z=L}\\) as arguments, use Equations K.9 and K.10 to evaluate the residuals, and return them."

    "text": "K.4 A Simplified Description of How the BVODEs are Solved\nThe description in this section is highly simplified, and it leaves out some details. It is intended only to provide a sense of how BVODEs are solved numerically. To start, the solver uses the information provided to it to divide the \\(x\\) range into many small intervals. It uses an approximating polynomial, e. g. \\(y = m_1x^3 + m_2x^2 + m_3x + m_4\\), to approximate each dependent variable in each of the intervals. That is, the values of \\(m_1\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_3\\), and \\(m_4\\) will be different for each dependent variable and in each interval. At this point those values are unknown, and solving the BVODEs equates to finding those values. Note that \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) can also be approximated by taking the derivative of the approximating polynomial. The equations used to find the values of the coefficients are based on requirements that the solution must meet.\n\nAt the boundary between any two intervals, the approximating polynomials on each side must yield the same value of \\(y\\).\nAt the two ends of the range of \\(x\\), the approximating polynomials must satisfy the boundary conditions in Equations K.5 and K.6.\nAt any point within an interval, the approximating functions must obey the ODEs, Equations K.7 and K.8.\n\nThere is an infinite number of points within the interval, so to meet this requirement distinct points within each interval, called collocation points, are chosen and this requirement is applied at those points. Typically, the collocation points include the two ends of the interval and as many equally-spaced points in between as are needed to calculate the values of \\(m_1\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_3\\), and \\(m_4\\) for every dependent variable in every interval.\n\n\nApplying those requirements leads to a set of non-linear equations that needs to be solved to find the values of \\(m_1\\), \\(m_2\\), \\(m_3\\), and \\(m_4\\) for every dependent variable in every interval. See Appendix H for an overview of how that is accomplished. Doing so requires an initial guess for the values; the solver generates the guess using the guess for the value of \\(y\\) that is provided to it."

    "text": "K.5 Cautions Related to Numerical Solution\nThe process of dividing the range of \\(x\\) into intervals is sometimes called mesh generation. The presentation here implied that the intervals were equally sized, but this is not required. If the solution varies very stronly in one part of the range of \\(x\\) and not in other parts, it is possible to use smaller intervals where it is varying strongly and larger intervals elsewhere. This can increase the accuracy of the result without increasing the amount of computation required.\nA related caution is that some solvers will adjust the number of intervals in order to maintain accuracy. As such, the number of intervals returned by the solver should not be assumed to equal the number specified in the call to the solver.\nIt won’t be encountered in Reaction Engineering Basics, but when BVODEs are written in cylindrical or spherical coordinates, a term may contain \\(x^{-1}\\). Then, if the range of \\(x\\) includes \\(0\\), that term will become infinite at that point. This is known as a singularity. If the BVODEs have such a singluarity, there are methods that have not been discussed here that can be used to solve them."
