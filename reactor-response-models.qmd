# Reactor Response Models

The first section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* presented an introduction to reactors and reaction engineering and reviewed basic facts about chemical reactions. The second section examined chemical reaction rates and rate expressions. This third section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* presents an approach to modeling ideal chemical reactors. It begins by considering what equations are needed to model the reactors and ends by describing how to construct a reactor response model using those equations. The structure of the reactor response model, as presented here, is designed to facilitate *numerical* solution of every kind of reaction engineering problem that is encountered in the remainder of *Reaction Engineering Basics*.
