# Reactor Response

The first section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* presented an introduction to reactors and reaction engineering and reviewed basic facts about chemical reactions. The second section examined chemical reaction rates and rate expressions. This third section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* presents an approach to modeling ideal chemical reactors. It begins by considering what equations are needed to model the reactors and ends by describing how to construct reactor response functions from those Models. The reactor response functions, as presented here, are designed to facilitate *numerical* solution of every kind of reaction engineering problem that is encountered in the remainder of *Reaction Engineering Basics*.
