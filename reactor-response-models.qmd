# Reactor Models

Reaction rates have been the focus of *Reaction Engineering Basics* up to this point. Having examined reaction rates and sources for rate expressions, the validation of reaction rate expressions is the next topic to be considered. Reactor models are needed in order to do that, as well as for most of the analysis presented in the rest of *Reaction Engineering Basics*. So this section offers a short break from rate expressions in order to discuss reactor models.
