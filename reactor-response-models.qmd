# Reactor Response Models

The first section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* presented an introduction to reaction engineering and reviewed basic facts about chemical reactions. The second section examined chemical reaction rates and the mathematical models for the rates of reactions, namely rate expressions. Models for reactors were not needed in either of those sections. This third section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* defines and describes one kind of reactor model called a reactor response model. The reactor response model defined here is structured in a way that is suitable for *numerical* solution of several kinds of reaction engineering problems. The reactor response models described in this section are used in each of the remaining sections of *Reaction Engineering Basics*.
