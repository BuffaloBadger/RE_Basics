# Modeling Ideal Reactor Systems

The first five sections of *Reaction Engineering Basics* considered reactions, reaction rates and reaction processes where the reaction system consisted of an ideal reactor and nothing else. This sixth section of *Reaction Engineering Basics* examines process systems that include other components in addition to an ideal reactor. The additional components include splitting and merging of flow streams, exchange of heat between flow streams and the presence of multiple reactors. As such, the reactor response models used in previous sections become one component of models for these simple ideal reactor systems.
