# Kinetics Data Analysis

The first part of *Reaction Engineering Basics* introduced the field of reaction engineering and reviewed basic facts about chemical reactions. The second part described and defined chemical reaction rates and rate expressions. It presented empirical and theoretical ways to propose the mathematical form of a rate expression.

After the mathematical form of a rate expression has been proposed, it must be validated using experimental kinetics data. Doing so requires mathematical modeling of reactors, which was explored in the next three parts of *Reaction Engineering Basics*.

Having examined the modeling of reactors, this sixth part of *Reaction Engineering Basics* returns to the subject of rate expressions. Specifically, it describes and illustrates the generation and analysis of kinetics data for the purpose of validating rate expressions. The design of experiments for gathering kinetics data is presented first, followed by three chapters that explain how to analyze data that were generated using ideal BSTRs, PFRs, and CSTRs.
