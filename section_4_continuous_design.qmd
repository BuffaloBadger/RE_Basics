# Design of Continuous Reactors {#sec-4_continuous_design}

Effectively, this chapter is a continuation of @sec-4_non_continuous_design. That chapter only considered the design of non-continuous reactor processes. It presented important design principles and described different levels of design before identifying preliminary design as being an appropriate level of design for the purposes of *Reaction Engineering Basics*.

Briefly, preliminary design begins with an underspecified reactor process to which the design engineer adds sufficient specifications to enable modeling and analysis of the process. It uses reactor performance metrics as indicators of process economics. Often a single key reactor performance metric is minimized or maximized with respect to one or more reactor process parameters being specified by the design engineer. Some process parameters or reactor outputs may be subject to constraints imposed by safety, operability, or regulatory considerations.

All of the discussion in @sec-4_non_continuous_design applies equally in the present chapter. However, it won't be duplicated here. Chapters 12 and 13 illustrated the modeling and analysis of two types of continuous reactors, namely the CSTR and the PFR. With that knowledge as background, this chapter considers two additional aspects of preliminary design. Specifically this chapter builds upon @sec-4_non_continuous_design by adding sections on the choice between non-continuous and continuous processes and on the choice bewteen CSTRs and PFRs in continuous processes.

## The Choice Between Non-Continuous and Continuous Processes

Most of the criteria used when choosing between a continuous process and a non-continuus process have already been mentioned in previous chapters. The most important criterion, perhpas, is the anticipated amount of the product to be produced anually. If the product is a commodity that is going to be produced and sold in large volumes, a continuous process is most likely preferred. The profit margin on commodity chemicals is often small, and production costs need to be minimized because they cannot be passed on to the consumer easily. Generally the additional labor and logistics of a non-continuous process lead to a larger production cost per pound of product compared to a continuous product.

In contrast, when a small annual production is anticipated, but the profit margin is large, a non-continuous process may be preferred. A non-continuous process allows production of value-added products on demand. This can reduce the costs associated with storing the products during seasons of low demand while allowing for ramping up production when demand is greater.

Another important factor is the number of different reactor operating conditions required to produce the product. If the "recipe" for making the product involves multiple reactive steps at different temperatures and of different durations, a non-continuous process will likely be preferred. For example if the reactive processing requires holding at one temperature for some period of time, then adding a reagent and holding at a different temperature for a different amount of time, a non-continuous process would probably be preferred. It is simply easier to follow this kind of recipe using a non-continuous process.

Similarly, if the reaction must be run at conditions where the reaction rate is very low, a non-continuous process may be the better choice. For processes where the rate is much faster, where additional reagents do not need to be added part way through the reaction process, and where multiple reaction temperatures are not required, a continuous process can be advantageous.

Flexibility is another consideration when deciding between a continuous and a non-continuous process. A non-continuous process may be more suitable if the same reactor will be used to produce different products at different times. That is, it may be more challenging to use the same feed and product piping to conduct one chemical processes part of the time and a different reaction at other times in a continuous reactor system. Generally continuous processes are best when they can be started up and allowed to operate at steady state for extended periods of time.

In the final analysis, though, none of these criteria are definitive. Ultimately the choice between using a non-continuous process or a continuous process comes down to economics.

## The Choice Between CSTRs and PFRs in Continuous Processes

In some instances the choice between a CSTR and a PFR is an easy one, but under other circumstances it is not clear at all. The most significant difference between the two reactor types is how the temperature and composition vary over the time during which the reacting fluid is in the reactor.

A CSTR operates at the final conditions for the entire time that the reacting fluid is in the reactor. As such, the reactant concentrations are at their lowest and the product concentrations are at their highest. If the CSTR is adiabatic or has little heat exchange, the temperature will be at its highest for an exothermic reaction and at its lowest for an endothermic reaction. If these properties are advantageous compared to a PFR (see next), a CSTR should be used. This situation is illustrated in @sec-example_14_3_1.

In a PFR, the composition and temperature vary continuously from their inlet values to their outlet values over the time while the reacting fluid is in the reactor. The reactant concentrations start high and decreases while the product concentrations start low and increase. If the PFR is adiabatic or has little heat exchange, the temperature will start low and increase if the reaction is exothermic and it will start high and decrease for if the reaction is endothermic. If these properties are advantageous compared to a CSTR, a PFR should be used. This situation is illustrated in @sec-example_14_3_2.

Sometimes, using the behaviors described above, a CSTR may be preferred on the basis of concentration variation while a PFR may be preferred on the basis of temperature variation, or vice versa. In these situations it may be necessary to analyze both. Similarly, if significant heat exchange is possible or required, the temperature variation during the time the reacting fluid is in the reactor may be different thatn that described above and a more detailed analysis may be needed to inform the choice of which reactor type to use.

CSTRs are not well-suited to reactions that require a solid catalyst, in which case the use of a PFR is obvious.

## Examples

The example presented in @sec-4_non_continuous_design describes possible design strategies an engineer might use when tasked with designing a non-continuous reactor for an auto-catalytic reaction. It focuses more upon selecting a key metric (the reactor volume) and identifying the operating parameters that can be varied to minimize that metric than on choosing the type of reactor to use.

The examples presented here focus upon initially choosing to use a CSTR, to use a PFR, or to analyze both reactor types before choosing one of them. Once that choice is made, design strategies analogous to the one presented in [Example -@sec-example_11] can be developed for the chosen reactor type(s).
