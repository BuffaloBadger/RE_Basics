Repository for *Reaction Engineering Basics*, an introductory text on chemical reaction kinetics and chemical reaction engineering.

So, for example, if you are teaching a course on reaction engineering you can clone this repository and use it to make a copy of the book on your own web site, as long as you follow the license above. There is a separate public repository, RE_Basics_Examples, for the solutions of the example problems. The .qmd files that make up this book, read problem statements and results from that repository. So you will either need to clone that repository and make sure links in the book point to it or change the way those items are read into the book. The data files and figures for the examples from that repository are duplicated in the Data and Graphics folders of this repository.
