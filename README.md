So, for example, if you are teaching a course on reaction engineering you can clone this repository and use it to make a copy of the book on your own web site, as long as you follow the license above. 

The problem statements for examples and the results generated when solving example problems are not included in this repository. There is a separate public repository, RE_Basics_Examples, the example problem statements and their solutions. That repository contains the problem statemens, matlab and python codes that perform the calculations, and the results from performing the calculations as .csv and .png files. For each example there is a Snakefile that updates the results if the code has been changed and copies the problem statements and the results, if they have changed, to the appropriate folders in this project.
