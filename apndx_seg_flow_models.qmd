# Segregated Flow Reactor Models {#sec-apndx_seg_flow}

Segregated flow reactor models (SFRMs) are used to simulate the performance of non-ideal, steady-state flow reactors. A key assumption in SFRMs is that fluid entering the non-ideal flow reactor at some instant does not all have the same residence time, $\tau$. The cumulative age distribution function for the non-ideal flow reactor, $F\left(\lambda\right)$ with $\tau=\lambda$, is used to represent the distribution of residence times leaving the non-ideal flow reactor. Hypothetical batch processes with variable reaction times, $t_r$, are used to simulate the non-ideal flow reactor with variable residence times, $\tau$.

This appendix only considers using SFRms to model steady-state non-ideal reactors that operate adiabatically at constant pressure. Many non-ideal reactors satisfy these assumptions. Typically stirred tanks operate at constant pressure, and some tubular reactors operate with negligible pressure drop. Modification of the SFRMs to include heat exchange and/or pressure change is considered in the final section of this appendix.

## Representing the Non-Ideal Flow Reactor Using Hypothetical Batch Processes

@fig-seg_flow_as_batch illustrates how the non-ideal flow reactor is represented by a hypothetical batch process. The top of the figure depicts the non-ideal flow reactor operating adiabatically at constant pressure and steady-state. An arbitrary interval of time, $\Delta t_B$, is used as a basis for representing the flow reactor using batch processing.

![Hypothetical batch process used to simulate the non-ideal flow reactor](Graphics/segregated_flow_model.png){#fig-seg_flow_as_batch width="80%"}

Everything that flows into the non-ideal reactor during that interval of time is taken as a sample. The molar amounts of the reagents are calculated using @eq-early_mix_mol_sample, and the temperature of the sample equals that of the feed, @eq-early_mix_T_sample. If the reacting fluid is a liquid, the volume of the sample can be calculated using @eq-early_mix_vol_sample. If it is a gas, the volume of the sample can be calculated using the ideal gas law. The concentrations of the reagents are then given by @eq-early_mix_C_sample.

$$
n_{i,s,0} = \dot{n}_{i,feed} \Delta t_B
$${#eq-early_mix_mol_sample}

$$
T_{s,0} = T_{feed}
$${#eq-early_mix_T_sample}

$$
V_{s,0} = \dot{V}_{feed} \Delta t_B
$${#eq-early_mix_vol_sample}

$$
C_{i,s,0} = \frac{n_{i,s,0}}{V_{s,0}}
$${#eq-early_mix_C_sample} 

As @fig-seg_flow_as_batch indicates, the sample is then subjected to batch processing. Two SFRMs can be formulated depending on the specifics of the batch processing methodology. At the end of the batch processing, the final molar amounts and temperature of the sample will be known. If the sample is an incompressible liquid, its volume will equal its initial volume, and if it is a gas, its volume can be calculated using the ideal gas law. The outlet, product molar flow rates for the non-ideal flow reactor are then found by assuming that the final sample leaves the flow reactor over the same interval of time as that used to generate it, @eq-seg_flow_prod_molar_flow. The temperature of the flowing product is taken to equal the final temperature of the sample, @eq-early_mix_prod_temp

$$
\dot{n}_{i,product} = \frac{n_{i,s,f}}{\Delta t_B}
$${#eq-early_mix_prod_molar_flow}

$$
T_{product} = T_{s,f}
$${#eq-early_mix_prod_temp}

## The Numerical Cumulative Age Distribution Function and its Derivative

The SFRMs are based upon the cumulative age distribution function for the non-ideal reactor being modeled. When the cumulative age distribution function is available as an analytical function, evaluating $F$ and $\frac{dF}{d \lambda}$ is straightforward, but that isn't usually the case. Most often the cumulative age distribution function is measured using stimulus-response experiments (see @sec-7_age_function). That is, the cumulative age distribution function is typically available as a table with columns containing corresponding values of $\lambda$ and $F$, not as an analytical function.

### The Tabular Form of the Cumulative Age Distribution Function

The fraction of fluid leaving a reactor with an age less than or equal to zero is zero by definition. Therefore, the first row in the tabular form of the cumulative age distribution always should be $\lambda$ = 0 and $F$ = 0. Eventually all of the fluid should leave the reactor, so the value of $F$ in the last row of the tabular form of the cumulative age distribution should always equal 1. In principle, the age of the very last bit of fluid to leave could be infinity, but practically it will be some finite age, $\lambda_f$.

The stimulus-response experiments used to generate the tabular form of the age distribution function will result in a finite value of $\lambda_f$. Two situations are possible. In one situation, the value of $F$ will be equal to 1 (within experimental error) before the end of the table. Beyond that point, as $\lambda$ increases, $F$ will remain equal to 1 (within experimental error).

However, if the stimulus-response experiments were not continued for sufficiently long time, the final value of $F$ in the tabular form of the cumulative age distribution function will not equal 1. In order to use the SFRMs, the cumulative age distribution function must range from $F=0$ to $F=1$. If the final value of $F$ is less than one, a row should be added to the table. In the added row, $F$ should equal 1, but the proper corresponding value of $\lambda$ is unknown. One way to choose the value of $\lambda_f$ is to linearly extrapolate using the last two entries in the experimental cumulative age distribution table to find the value of $\lambda$ where $F$ equals 1, @eq-age_fcn_added_lambda.

$$
\lambda_f = \left(1 - F\big\vert_{\lambda_{f-2}}\right)\frac{\lambda_{f-1} - \lambda_{f-2}}{F\big\vert_{\lambda_{f-1}} - F\big\vert_{\lambda_{f-2}}} + \lambda_{f-2}
$${#eq-age_fcn_added_lambda} 

To summarize, the cumulative age distribution function will be a table with two columns. The first column should contain values of $\lambda$, and the value in the first row of that column should be zero. The second column should contain corresponding values of $F$. The value in the first row of the $F$ column should be zero, and the value in the last row of the $F$ column should equal 1 to within experimental uncertainty. 

### Evaluating F for a Given Value of $\lambda$

When using the SFRMs, the value of $F$ corresponding to a given value of $\lambda$ may be needed. That value must be found using the tabular cumulative age distribution function. If the given value of $\lambda$ is zero, $F$ is equal to zero, @eq-age_fcn_at_lambda_equals_zero. If the given of $\lambda$ is greater than or equal to $\lambda_f$, $F$ is equal to one, @eq-age_fcn_at_lambda_ge_lambda_f. For any other given value of $\lambda$, $F$ can be calculated using linear interpolation.

$$
F\left(0\right) = 0
$${#eq-age_fcn_at_lambda_equals_zero}

$$
F\left(\lambda \right)\big\vert_{\lambda \ge \lambda_f} = 1
$${#eq-age_fcn_at_lambda_ge_lambda_f}

To begin, the row, $i$, in the table with the with the greatest value of $\lambda$ that is less than or equal to the given value is identified, @eq-age_fcn_interpolation_row. Of course if $\lambda$ in row $i$ is equal to the given value, then $F$ is simply set equal to the value of $F$ in row $i$, @eq-age_fcn_interpolation_row_is_exact. Otherwise, the value of $F$ is found by interpolating between row $i$ and row $i-1$, @eq-age_fcn_interpolation.

$$
i = \underset{k}{\max}\left( k: \, \lambda_k \le \lambda \right)
$${#eq-age_fcn_interpolation_row}

$$
F\left(\lambda\right)\big\vert_{\lambda = \lambda_i} = F\left(\lambda_i\right)
$${#eq-age_fcn_interpolation_row_is_exact}

$$
F\left(\lambda\right) = F_{i-1} + \frac{F_i - F_{i-1}}{\lambda_i - \lambda_{i-1}} \left( \lambda - \lambda_{i-1} \right)
$${#eq-age_fcn_interpolation}

### Evaluating $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$ for a Given Value of $\lambda$

Similarly, when using the SFRMs, the value of $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$ corresponding to a given value of $\lambda$ may be needed, and must be found using the tabular cumulative age distribution function. If the given value of $\lambda$ is zero, then $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$ is equal to zero, @eq-d_age_fcn_at_lambda_equals_zero. If the given value of $\lambda$ is greater than or equal to $\lambda_f$, $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$ again is equal to zero, @eq-d_age_fcn_at_lambda_ge_lambda_f. For any other given value of $\lambda$, the row, $i$, in the table with the with the greatest value of $\lambda$ that is less than or equal to the desired value should be identified as before, @eq-age_fcn_interpolation_row. The corresponding value of $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$ should be taken to equal the linear slope between rows $i$ and $i-1$, @eq-d_age_fcn_interpolation.

$$
\frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda=0} = 0.0
$${#eq-d_age_fcn_at_lambda_equals_zero}

$$
\frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda \ge \lambda_f} = 0.0
$${#eq-d_age_fcn_at_lambda_ge_lambda_f}

$$
\frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda} = \frac{F_i - F_{i-1}}{\lambda_i - \lambda_{i-1}}
$${#eq-d_age_fcn_interpolation}

## The Early-Mixing Segregated Flow Reactor Model

In the early mixing SFRM, the sample is assumed to be perfectly mixed and instantaneously added to an adiabatic, constant pressure BSTR. If all of the fluid was assumed to remain in the BSTR, the concentrations of the reagents, $\overline{C}_i$, temperature, $\overline{T}$, and relative volume, $\overline{\gamma} = \frac{\overline{V}}{V_0}$ as a functions of reaction time, $t_r$, can be determined by solving the BSTR reactor design equations for an adiabatic, constant pressure BSTR.

:::{.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Note

If the reacting fluid is a liquid and can be assumed to have constant density, then $\overline{\gamma} = 1.0$ for all reaction times. However, if the reacting fluid is a gas, its volume can change over time in a constant pressure BSTR due to changes in the total number of moles and the temperature. In this case, $\overline{\gamma}$ will vary with reaction time. Because different fractions of the initial fluid will be removed at different reaction times, $\overline{\gamma}$ is needed to calculate the volume of each fraction at the time it is removed from the reactor.

:::

The early mixing SFRM starts by considering only the fraction of the initial fluid, $dF\big\vert_{t_r}$, that is going to remain in the BSTR for a reaction time between $t_r$ and $t_r + dt_r$. The volume of that fraction of the fluid, $dV\big\vert_{t_r}$, can be calculated using @eq-early_mix_frac_of_init_vol, which accounts for expansion/contraction due to reaction.

$$
dV\big\vert_{t_r} = V_{s,0} \overline{\gamma}\big\vert_{t_r} dF\big\vert_{t_r} = V_{s,0} \overline{\gamma}\big\vert_{t_r} \frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda = t_r}dt_r
$${#eq-early_mix_frac_of_init_vol}

The moles of reagent $i$ in that fraction of the fluid, $dn_i$, can be calculated by multiplying the volume by the concentration of $i$, @eq-early_mix_moles_in_frac. The temperature of the fluid at that time is simply equal to $\overline{T}\big\vert_\tau$.

$$
dn_i = V_{s,0} \overline{\gamma}\big\vert_{t_r} \overline{C}_i\big\vert_{t_r} \frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda = {t_r}}dt_r
$${#eq-early_mix_moles_in_frac}

The total moles of $i$ that are removed from the BSTR is simply the sum of the amounts corresponding to reaction times between $t_r = 0$ and $t_r = \lambda_f$ (i. e. the age where $F$ becomes equal to 1 and all of the fluid has been removed). Because the reaction time intervals are differential, the sum takes the form of an integral. Thus, the final moles of reagent $i$ in the sample after batch processing is found using @eq-early_mix_total_moles.

$$
n_{i,s,f} = V_{s,0} \int_0^{\lambda_f} \overline{\gamma}\big\vert_{t_r} \overline{C}_i\big\vert_{t_r} \frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda = t_r}dt_r
$${#eq-early_mix_total_moles}

Each fraction of the fluid may be at a different temperature when it is removed. The final temperature, $T_{s,f}$ that results when all of the fluid fractions are recombined can be calculated by assiming the fluid fractions mix adiabatically. In terms of molar heat capacities, this leads to the implicit equation for $T_{s,f}$ shown in @eq-early_mix_final_T_molar. In terms of the volumetric heat capacity of the fluid, it leads to the implicit equation for $T_{s,f}$ shown in @eq-early_mix_final_T_vol.

$$
\sum_i \left( dn_i\big\vert_{t_r} \int_{\overline{T}_{t_r}}^{T_{s,f}} \hat{C}_{p,i} dT\right) = V_{s,0} \int_0^{\lambda_f} \overline{\gamma}\big\vert_{t_r} \frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda = t_r} \left( \sum_i  \overline{C}_i\big\vert_{t_r} \int_{\overline{T}_{t_r}}^{T_{s,f}} \hat{C}_{p,i} dT \right)dt_r = 0
$$

$$
T_{s,f} : \, V_{s,0} \int_0^{\lambda_f} \overline{\gamma}\big\vert_{t_r} \frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda = t_r} \left( \sum_i  \overline{C}_i\big\vert_{t_r} \int_{\overline{T}_{t_r}}^{T_{s,f}} \hat{C}_{p,i} dT \right)dt_r = 0
$${#eq-early_mix_final_T_molar}

$$
T_{s,f} : \, V_{s,0} \int_0^{\lambda_f} \overline{\gamma}\big\vert_{t_r} \frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda = t_r} \left(\int_{\overline{T}_{t_r}}^{T_{s,f}} \breve{C}_pdT \right)dt_r = 0
$${#eq-early_mix_final_T_vol}

Equations [-@eq-early_mix_prod_molar_flow] and [-@eq-early_mix_prod_temp] can then be used to molar flow rates and temperature of the product stream leaving the non-ideal flow reactor.

### Numerical Implementation of the Early-Mixing Segregated Flow Reactor Model

For the most part, the early-mixing SFRM calculations are straightforward. A time interval is chosen as a basis for the calculations the initial molar amounts of the reagents, temperature, volume and reagent concentrations in the sample are calculated, Equations [-@eq-early_mix_mol_sample] through [-@eq-early_mix_C_sample].

The next step is to solve the constant pressure BSTR design equations to find $\overline{C}_i$, $\overline{T}$, and $\overline{\gamma} = \frac{\overline{V}}{V_0}$ as a functions of reaction time, $t_r$. Looking ahead, these quantities will be used in @eq-early_mix_total_moles and either @eq-early_mix_final_T_molar or @eq-early_mix_final_T_vol. Those equations also include $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}\bigg\vert_{\lambda = t_r}$.

As already noted, the cumulative age distribution function usually is measured using stimulus-response experiments (see @sec-7_age_function). That is, the cumulative age distribution function is typically available as a table with columns containing corresponding values of $\lambda$ and $F$, not as an analytical function. As a consequence, $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$ will be calculated using finite differences. In other words, $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$ will be available as a table with columns for $lambda$ and for $\frac{dF}{d\lambda}$.

Noting that @eq-early_mix_total_moles and either @eq-early_mix_final_T_molar or @eq-early_mix_final_T_vol will be integrated numerically (e. g. using the trapezoid rule), it makes sense to use solve the BSTR design equations for values of $\overline{C}_i$, $\overline{T}$, and $\overline{\gamma} = \frac{\overline{V}}{V_0}$ at reaction times, $t_r$ equal to the values of $\lambda$ in the cumulative age distribution function table. When that is done, the integral in @eq-early_mix_total_moles and either @eq-early_mix_final_T_molar or @eq-early_mix_final_T_vol can be integrated directly. (If the BSTR design equations are solved for an arbitrary range of values of $t-r$, additional interpolation steps would be needed when performing the numerical integration).

After @eq-early_mix_total_moles and either @eq-early_mix_final_T_molar or @eq-early_mix_final_T_vol have been solved, the calculation of the flow reactor product flow rates and temperature is trivially implemented.

## The Late-Mixing Segregated Flow Reactor Model

In the late-mixing SFRM the hypothetical batch processing takes place in an adiabatic, constant pressure SBSTR. The sample is added to that SBSTR over time. Defining $t=0$ to be the instant that addition of the sample to the SBSTR begins, the SBSTR continues to operate until the very last bit of sample has been added, at which time operation of the SBSTR ceases. In other words, SBSTR operation begins at $t=0$ and ends at $t=\lambda_f$.

The fraction of the sample that enters the SBSTR at $t=0$ will have an age of $\lambda_f$ at the end of the semi-batch processing. As the time at which fluid enters the SBSTR increases, its age at the end of the process becomes smaller. Put differently, fluid already in the SBSTR will have a greater age at the end of the process than fluid that has not yet entered the SBSTR.

By definition, at any time, $t$, the fraction of the sample that has not yet entered the SBSTR is equal to $F\left(\lambda\right) \big\vert_{\lambda_f - t}$ because at the end of semi-batch processing it will have an age less than $\lambda_f - t$. Consequently, the moles of reagent $i$ in the sample that have not yet entered the SBSTR is given by @eq-late_mix_not_entered. The rate at which the reagent i enters the SBSTR is then simply the time derivative of $n_i$, @eq-late_mix_molar_flow_in.

$$
n_i = n_{i,s,0} F\left(\lambda\right) \big\vert_{\lambda_f - t}
$${#eq-late_mix_not_entered}

$$
\dot{n}_i = n_{i,s,0} \frac{dF}{d\lambda} \biggr\vert_{\lambda_f - t}
$${#eq-late_mix_molar_flow_in}

The temperature of the fluid entering the SBSTR is equal to the temperature of the feed to the non-ideal reactor being modeled, $T_{s,0}$. The SBSTR design equations can be solved to find the molar amounts of the reagents in the SBSTR and the temperature at the end of the process (when $t=\lambda_f$). These are the final molar amounts and temperature of the sample, $n_{i,s,f}$ and $T_{s,f}$.

## Accounting for Pressure Drop and Heat Exchange

The early-mixing and late-mixing segregated flow reactor models above were developed with the assumption that the pressure is constant, so if the reacting fluid is a gas, it may expand or contract. This is a common situation for flow reactors. Stirred tanks normally operate at constant pressure, and often for tubular reactors the pressure drop along the length of the reactor is negligible. If the pressure in the steady-state, non-ideal reactor varies with position, an equation for the variation of the pressure with reaction time could be added to the segregated flow reactor models above. For example, if the non-ideal reactor is tubular and the pressure drops along its length, the pressure *vs.* length relationship could be introduced to the segregated flow models as pressure *vs.* reaction time.

Adapting the segregated flow reactor models to include heat exchange is not as obvious. One option would be to assume that the BSTR or SBSTR in the SFRM has the same heat transfer area to reactor volume as the non-ideal reactor being modeled. In *Reaction Engineering Basics* the segregated flow models are only used to model isothermal or adiabatic reactors with constant pressure.
