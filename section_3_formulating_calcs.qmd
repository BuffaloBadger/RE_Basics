# Completing Reaction Engineering Tasks {#sec-3_formulating_calcs}

To complete common reaction engineering tasks, reactor models must be generated and the equations in them must be solved. @sec-3_react_eng_models showed how to generate the reactor design equations for the four ideal reactor types, and @sec-3_react_eng_tasks described four types of reaction engineering tasks. This chapter presents a general workflow that is used throughout the remainder of the book to complete reaction engineering assignments..

## Summarizing Reaction Engineering Assignments {#sec-3_summarize_assignment}

In a book like this, reaction engineering assignments take the form of a brief narrative that provides data and then assigns tasks and/or asks questions. An assignment summary provides a concise summary of the information in the assignment narrative. A good summary makes it possible to complete the assignment without needing to refer back to the assignment narrative.

The information provided in an assignment narrative will vary depending upon the specific tasks being assigned. As such, the items listed here will not all appear in any one assignment summary. The order of the items in the summary is not important.

Reaction(s)
: Every reaction occurring in the system being analyzed should be listed and numbered.

Rate Expression(s)
: If known or proposed, the rate expression for each reaction above should be listed and numbered.

Reactor System
: Each reactor present in the system being analyzed should be listed. For each one, its type and operational details should be included.

Reactor System Schematic
: A schematic diagram of the system being analyzed should be included. Each flow stream and piece of equipment should be given a unique label that can be used as a subscript on variables appearing in the model equations.

Adjusted Experimental Inputs
: When experimental data are being analyzed, quantities that were varied from one experiment to the next should be identified.

Stimulus Type
: If stimulus-response data are being analyzed, the type of stimulus should be listed.

Experimental Response
: When experimental data are being analyzed, quantities that were measured in each experiment should be identified.

Quantities of Interest
: Any variables for which the assignment requests value should be listed. If graphs or tables are requested, they should be listed along with the quantities needed to generate them. If an assessment is requested, the data needed to make it should be listed.

Parameters
: If the assignment entails varying parameters or estimating the values of parameters, the parameters should be listed. If values of parameters to be varied are specified, they should be included in the listing.

Given and Known Constants
: Each quantity for which the assignment narrative provides a value should be listed, along with the given value.

Basis
: If all of the values provided in the assignment narrative are intensive, a value can be chosen for one extensive variable. The chosen value is called the basis, and it should be included in the assignment summary.

## Generating Model Equations

The assignment summary should include all of the information needed for generating the model equations for the system. @sec-3_react_eng_models describes how to generate the reactor design equations for each reactor in the system starting from the appropriate mole, energy and momentum balances. The design equations for any one reactor will be a set of either ATEs, IVODEs, DAEs, or BVODEs.

For each reactor in the system, the mole, energy and momentum balances should be simplified as appropriate and the variables to be found by solving them should be identified. If the design equations are ATEs, equations defining an initial guess for the ATE variables should be added. If they are IVODEs, equations defining the initial and final values should be added. If they are DAEs, equations defining both an intial guess for the ATE variables and initial and final values for the IVODE variables should be added. If the design equations are BVODEs, equations should be added for the boundary condition residual expressions, the initial mesh, and the initial guess for the dependent variables.

After writing the design equations and the supporting equations listed above, the design equations should be examined to identify all additional unknowns. Equations for calculating each additional unknown using the design equation variables and known constants should be added to the model reactor.

If the system contains any additional equipment that is not part of any of the reactor models, models for that equipment should also be generated. In *Reaction Engineering Basics,* heat exchangers, stream splitting points, and stream mixing points are the only additional equipment that might be present. Mole and energy balances should be generated for each piece of equipment. These model equations will be ATEs. As for the reactors, the ATE variables should be identified, equations defining an initial guess for the ATE variables should be added, additional unknowns should be identifies, and equations for calculating the additional unknowns using the ATE variables and known constants should be added to the equipment model.

The model equations for each reactor and other piece of equipment will be soved to find the identified variables for that reactor or equipment. A final "model" should be developed that includes equations for calculating all of the quantities of interest using known constants and the variables found by solving the design equations for the reactor(s) and other equipment.

## Formulating Numerical Calculations {#sec-3_formulate_calculations}

In some scenarios the reactor design equations can be solved analytically, but in many more situations, analytical solution is not possible. Numerical solution is necessary for many important, real-world situations that involve adiabatic operation, multiple reactions, complex rate expressions, non-isothermal operation involving heat exchange, and others.  Therefore, in *Reaction Engineering Basics* the reactor design equations are always solved numerically, even if analytical solution is possible.

Different readers of *Reaction Engineering Basics* may choose to use different mathematics software when completing assignments. For this reason, code for performing numerical calculations is not presented nor provided in the book. Fortunately, computer functions for solving sets of a given type of equations all require essentially the same input, irrespective of the specific mathematics software package they come from. This makes it possible to formulate the calculations needed to complete an assignment by writing specifications for the functions that are needed. Then the specifications can be used to write the actual code using whatever software package one chooses.

The assignment summary and the models generated as described above provide all of the information needed for formulating the numerical calculations. Basically, for each model generated above, specifications for functions to solve the model equations are written. So, for example, if a model for a BSTR was generated above, specifications for functions for solving the BSTR reactor design equations would be included in the formulation of the calculations.

Each model will require specifications for two or three functions, depending of the type of equations involved. @sec-apndx_mathematics describes the functions needed for solving ATE, IVODEs, DAEs, or IVODEs. For each reactor or equipment model, one of the functions will be the reactor (or equipment) model function. This is the function that calls the appropriate equation solver to solve the model equations and returns the results. The specifications for a model function will include (a) the arguments the function accepts, (b) the quantities the function returns, and (c) the algorithm for the function. Here "algorithm" is taken to mean the sequence of equations used to calculate the return values, not a computer logic diagram.

In addition to the model function, specifications at least one additional function must be added to the formulation of the calculations. These functions are described in @sec-apndx_mathematics. If the model equations are ATEs, specifications for a residuals function must be added. If the model equations are IVODEs, specifications for a derivatives function must be added. If the model equations are DAEs, specifications for both a residuals function and a derivatives function must be added. Finally, if the model equations are BVODEs, specifications for a boundary conditions residuals function and for a derivatives function must be added to the formulation of the calculations. The specifications for each of these functions will include (a) the arguments the function accepts, (b) a list of the quantities that must be made available to it by some means other than as an argument, (c) the quantities the function returns, and (d) the algorithm for the function.

The quantitities of interest "model" is different in that it will call the other model functions, but not any equation solvers from the mathematics software package. Consequently, no additional functions are associated with it. The specifications for it should indicate the arguments, return values, and algorithm. Typically, however, it takes no arguments and returns nothing. The output it generates is normally displayed on screen and saved to a file for later use.

## Implementing and Executing Calculations

The assignment summary and the formulation of the calculations will include all of the information that is needed to write the code to perform the calculations using the mathematics software package of one's choice. In *Reaction Engineering Basics,* this stage of the workflow is mentioned, but code is not shown for reasons already mentioned.

## Presenting and Discussing Results {#sec-3_assignment_discussion} 

The final component of the assignment completion workflow described here involves discussing the results of the calculation and presenting the quantities of interest as requested in the assignment narrative. While it is often tempting to simply report the results, a better approach includes discussion of the results.

For some calculations, an initial guess is provided to the solvers that solve the model equations. If the specified guess did not yield a converged solution, a discussion of how the guess was modified and the reasoning behind it can be useful. Similarly, if the assignment requested an assessment, for example on the accuracy of a model that was fit to experimental data, the reasoning behind the final assessment can be included.

It is also worthwhile to discuss whether the results appear to be reasonable. This is particulary relevant when one is just learning reaction engineering. It causes the engineer to think about the results, and helps develop a greater depth of understanding. Discussions of this kind are often supported by a qualitative analysis of the system as described in @sec-3_qualitative_analysis.  Every assignment is different, but there is almost always some aspect of the results or conclusions that merits further discussion.
