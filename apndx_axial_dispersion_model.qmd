# Axial Dispersion Reactor Models {#sec-apndx_axial_dispersion}

This appendix starts with the mole and energy balances for an ideal PFR. It adds dispersion terms to allow for mixing of heat and mass in the axial direction, leading to one form of the transient axial dispersion reactor design equations. In anticipation of solving the steady-state versions of those equations numerically, it then shows how the steady state axial dispersion mole and energy balances can be re-written as an equivalent set of first-order differential equations. Conventionally the axial dispersion model is written using the superficial velocity of the fluid in the $z$-direction, $u_z$, but for consistency with the other chapters in *Reaction Engineering Basics* it is written here in terms of the volumetric flow rate.

## Axial Dispersion Reactor Design Equations

The transient mole and energy balances for a PFR are derived in @sec-apndx_ideal_reactor_models. They serve as the starting point for the derivation of the axial dispersion reactor design equations. The assumption of plug flow is retained in the axial dispersion model. The only modification to the PFR mole and energy balances is addition of the term, $-D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d^2C_i}{dz^2}$, to the ideal PFR mole balance, and the term, $-\lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2}$ to the ideal PFR reacting fluid energy balance.

### The Transient Axial Dispersion Mole Balance

The generation of the axial dispersion mole balance begins with ideal PFR mole balance. 

$$
\frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2\dot n_i}{4\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

The dispersion term is added, noting that because $C_i$ varies with both $t$ and $z$, it uses a partial derivative.

$$
\frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2\dot n_i}{4\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

This presents a dilemma because the concentration, $C_i$, is the dependent variable in the axial dispersion term, but the molar flow rate, $\dot{n}_i$, is the dependent variable in the ideal PFR mole balance. Consequently, either the dispersion term must be re-written in terms of the molar flow rate, or, the molar flow rate of the PFR mole balance must be re-written in terms of the concentration. Practically, the axial dispersion mole balance is much more tractable when it is written using the concentration as the dependent variable, so the terms including the molar flow rate need to be re-expressed in terms of the concentration. To do so, both sides of the equation first are multiplied by by $\frac{4}{\pi D^2}$.

$$
\frac{1}{\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\dot n_i}{\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

Noting that $C_i = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\dot{V}}$ so $\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\dot n_i}{\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t}$ facilitates conversion of the dependent variable in the time derivatives.

$$
\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

Similarly noting that $\dot{n}_i$ = $\dot{V} C_i$ eliminates the molar flow rate as the dependent varibles in the $z$ derivative.

$$
\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left( \dot{V} C_i \right) = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

Applying the chain rule for differentiation then yields the desired form of the mole balance

$$
\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z} + \frac{4 C_i}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial \dot{V}}{\partial z} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

### The Transient Axial Dispersion Energy Balance

The generation of the energy balance begins with the ideal PFR reacting fluid energy balance.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\pi D^2}{4 \dot{V}} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \pi DU\left( T_{ex} - T \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

The dispersion term is added, again noting that because $T$ varies with both $t$ and $z$, a partial derivative is used.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\pi D^2}{4 \dot{V}} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} -\lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \pi DU\left( T_{ex} - T \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

Both sides of the equation can then be multiplied by $\frac{4}{\pi D^2}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\dot{V}} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - \lambda_{ax} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \frac{4U}{D} \left( T_{ex} - T \right) -  \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

Noting that $\dot{n}_i$ = $\dot{V} C_i$ allows elimination of the molar flow rate, and after doing so, $\dot{V}$ can be factored out of the summations yielding the desired form of the axial dispersion energy balance.

$$
\begin{align}
\left( \sum_i C_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - \lambda_{ax} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + \frac{4\dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left( \sum_i C_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \frac{4U}{D} \left( T_{ex} - T \right) -  \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

### The Steady-State Axial Dispersion Reactor Design Equations.

In this book transient, non-ideal, tubular reactors will not be analyzed. The transient design equations were presented above for the sake of completeness. When the reactor operates at steady-state, all of the time derivatives are equal to zero, and the spatial derivatives become ordinary derivatves.

$$
- D_{ax} \frac{d^2C_i}{dz^2} + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{dC_i}{dz} + \frac{4 C_i}{\pi D^2} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- \lambda_{ax}\frac{d^2 T}{d z^2} + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left(\sum_i C_i \hat{C}_{p,i}\right) \frac{d T}{d z} = \frac{4U}{D}\left(T_{ex} - T\right) - \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

The two design equations above contain three dependent variables, $C_i$, $T$, and $\dot{V}$, so an additional design equation is needed. If the reacting fluid is an incompressible liquid, then the volumetric flow rate does not change.

$$
\frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = 0 \qquad \text{liquids}
$$

For gas phase reactants, the mole balances can be summed, and the total concentration can be expressed in terms of the ideal gas law.

$$
- D_{ax} \frac{d^2}{dz^2}\left(\sum_i C_i\right) + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{d}{dz}\left(\sum_i C_i\right) + \frac{4}{\pi D^2}\left(\sum_i C_i\right) \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = \sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- D_{ax} \frac{d^2}{dz^2}\left(\frac{P}{RT}\right) + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{d}{dz}\left(\frac{P}{RT}\right) + \frac{4P}{\pi D^2 RT} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = \sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- D_{ax} \frac{d^2}{dz^2}\left(\frac{P}{T}\right) + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{d}{dz}\left(\frac{P}{T}\right) + \frac{4P}{\pi D^2 T} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = R\sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j \qquad \text{ideal gases}
$$

If the temperature of the heat exchange fluid is not known, an anergy balance on that fluid needs to be added to the design equations, and if there is pressure drop, a momentum balance must also be added. If pressure drop is negligible, the pressure can be factored out of the total mole balance above and the derivatives of the reciprocal of the temperature can be expanded using the chain rule.

$$
- D_{ax}P \left(\frac{2}{T^3}\frac{dT}{dz} - \frac{1}{T^2}\frac{d^2T}{dz^2}\right) - \frac{4P \dot{V}}{\pi D^2T^2} \frac{dT}{dz} + \frac{4P}{\pi D^2 T} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = R\sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
\frac{D_{ax}P}{T^2}\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} - \left(\frac{2D_{ax}P}{T^3}+ \frac{4P \dot{V}}{\pi D^2T^2}\right) \frac{dT}{dz} + \frac{4P}{\pi D^2 T} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = R\sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
D_{ax}\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} - \left(\frac{2D_{ax}}{T}+ \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\right) \frac{dT}{dz} + \frac{4T}{\pi D^2} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = \frac{RT^2}{P}\sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j \qquad \text{constant P}
$$

### Steady-State Axial Dispersion Model Boundary Conditions

The axial dispersion design equations include second derivatives of the concentrations and temperature and the first derivative of the volumetric flow rate. Solving them then requires two boundary conditions for each of the concentrations and for the temperature and one boundary condition for the volumetric flow rate. There are a few different ways to write the boundary conditions. The Danckwerts boundary conditions will be presented here.

The Danckwerts boundary conditions assume that upstream from the reactor inlet, the flow of each reagent is purely convective. Within the reactor the net flow of each reagent is the combination of convection and the diffusion-like flux. This is illustrated in @fig-axial_dispersion_inlet. Similar assumptions are made for energy.

![Due to mixing in the axial direction, the concentrations and temperature at the inlet are not equal to the feed concentrations and temperature.](Graphics/axial_dispersion_adiabatic.png){#fig-axial_dispersion_inlet width="50%"}

The Danckwerts boundary conditions simply assume that the purely convective feed flow is equal to the total flow rate at the inlet, which consists of a convective component and the flux-like flow associated with the mixing. Similarly, for the energy balance they assume the purely convective heat flow equals the sum of the inlet convective flow and the conduction-like flux due to mixing.

$$
\dot{V}_{feed}C_{i,feed} = \dot{V}_0 C_{i,0} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{dC_i}{dz}\Bigg\vert_{z=0}
$$

$$
\dot{V}_{feed}\sum_i\left(C_{i,feed} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) T_{feed} = \dot{V}_0 \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) T_0 - \lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{dT}{dz}\Bigg\vert_{z=0}
$$

A second boundary condition is needed for each $C_i$ and for $T$. Because the reactor ends at $z=L$, it can be assumed that the concentrations and temperature will stop changing at that point. Doing so yields the additional boundary conditions. The boundary condition for the volumetric flow rate is discussed below.

$$
\frac{dC_i}{dz}\Bigg\vert_{z=L} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dz}\Bigg\vert_{z=L} = 0
$$

For liquid-phase reacting fluids, no other boundary conditions are needed because the derivative of the volumetric flow rate is equal to zero. For ideal gases, the Danckwerts boundary conditions for the reagent concentrations can again be summed, and the total concentration can be expressed in terms of the ideal gas law.

$$
\dot{V}_{feed}\sum_iC_{i,feed} = \dot{V}_0 \sum_iC_{i,0} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d}{dz}\left(\sum_iC_i\right)\Biggr\vert_{z=0}
$$

$$
\frac{P_{feed}\dot{V}_{feed}}{RT_{feed}} = \frac{P_0\dot{V}_0}{RT_0} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d}{dz}\left(\frac{P}{RT}\right)\Bigg\vert_{z=0}
$$

$$
\frac{P_{feed}\dot{V}_{feed}}{T_{feed}} = \frac{P_0\dot{V}_0}{T_0} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d}{dz}\left(\frac{P}{T}\right)\Bigg\vert_{z=0}
$$

$$
\frac{P_{feed}\dot{V}_{feed}}{T_{feed}} = \frac{P_0\dot{V}_0}{T_0} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \left(\frac{1}{T_0}\frac{dP}{dz}\Bigg\vert_{z=0} -\frac{P_0}{T_0^2}\frac{dT}{dz}\Bigg\vert_{z=0} \right)
$$

## Equivalent First-Order, Steady-State Design Equations and Boundary Conditions

Recognizing that the design equations will be solved numerically, it is useful to rewrite them as an equivalent set of first-order ODEs. This can be accomplished by defining new variables, $\omega_i$ and $\omega_T$.

$$
\frac{dC_i}{dz} = \omega_i
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dz} = \omega_T
$$

Noting that then $\frac{d^2C_i}{dz^2} = \frac{d\omega_i}{dz}$ and $\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} = \frac{d\omega_T}{dz}$, substitution into the second-order design equations converts them to first-order ODEs.

$$
- D_{ax}\frac{d \omega_i}{d z} + \frac{4 C_i}{\pi D^2} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\omega_i + \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- \lambda_{ax}\frac{d \omega_T}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left(\sum_i C_i \hat{C}_{p,i}\right) \omega_T + \frac{4U}{D}\left(T_{ex} - T\right) - \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

$$
D_{ax}\frac{d \omega_T}{d z} + \frac{4T}{\pi D^2} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = \left(\frac{2D_{ax}}{T}+ \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\right) \omega_T + \frac{RT^2}{P}\sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j \qquad \text{constant P}
$$

The boundary conditions must also be expressed in terms of the new variables. Substitution in the Danckwerts boundary conditions and rearrangement yields their equivalent first-order forms.

$$
C_{i,0} = \frac{1}{\dot{V}_0} \left(\dot{V}_{feed}C_{i,feed} + D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \omega_{i,0}\right)
$$

$$
T_0 =  \frac{1}{\dot{V}_0 \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)}\left(\dot{V}_{feed} \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)T_{feed} + \lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \omega_{T,0}\right)
$$

Similarly, substitution in the boundary conditions at $z=L$ yields the equivalent first-order boundary conditions.

$$
\omega_i\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{i,1} = 0
$$

$$
\omega_T\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{T,1} = 0
$$

Substitution in the boundary condition for the balance on the total moles yields the equivalent boundary conditions.

$$
\frac{P_{feed}\dot{V}_{feed}}{T_{feed}} = \frac{P_0\dot{V}_0}{T_0} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \left(\frac{1}{T_0}\frac{dP}{dz}\Bigg\vert_{z=0} -\frac{P_0}{T_0^2}\omega_{T,0} \right)
$$

If pressure drop is negligible, this simplifies further.

$$
\frac{\dot{V}_{feed}}{T_{feed}} = \frac{\dot{V}_0}{T_0} + D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4T_0^2} \omega_{T,0}
$$

## Summary

The axial dispersion mole and energy balances can be written as a set of first-order boundary-value ODEs. When the reacting fluid is an incompressible liquid, the design equations and boundary conditions take the following form.

$$
\frac{dC_i}{dz} = \omega_i
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dz} = \omega_T
$$

$$
- D_{ax}\frac{d \omega_i}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\omega_i + \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- \lambda_{ax}\frac{d \omega_T}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left(\sum_i C_i \hat{C}_{p,i}\right) \omega_T + \frac{4U}{D}\left(T_{ex} - T\right) - \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

$$
C_{i,0} = C_{i,feed} + D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot{V}} \omega_{i,0}
$$

$$
T_0 =  T_{feed} + \lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot{V} \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)} \omega_{T,0}
$$

$$
\omega_i\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{i,1} = 0
$$

$$
\omega_T\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{T,1} = 0
$$

When the reacting fluid is an ideal gas and pressure drop is negligible, the axial dispersion design equations and boundary conditions take the following form:

$$
\frac{dC_i}{dz} = \omega_i
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dz} = \omega_T
$$

$$
- D_{ax}\frac{d \omega_i}{d z} + \frac{4 C_i}{\pi D^2} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\omega_i + \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- \lambda_{ax}\frac{d \omega_T}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left(\sum_i C_i \hat{C}_{p,i}\right) \omega_T + \frac{4U}{D}\left(T_{ex} - T\right) - \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

$$
D_{ax}\frac{d \omega_T}{d z} + \frac{4T}{\pi D^2} \frac{d\dot{V}}{dz} = \left(\frac{2D_{ax}}{T}+ \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\right) \omega_T + \frac{RT^2}{P}\sum_i\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
C_{i,0} = \frac{1}{\dot{V}_0} \left(\dot{V}_{feed}C_{i,feed} + D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \omega_{i,0}\right)
$$

$$
T_0 =  \frac{1}{\dot{V}_0 \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)}\left(\dot{V}_{feed} \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)T_{feed} + \lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \omega_{T,0}\right)
$$

$$
\dot{V}_0 =  \dot{V}_{feed}\frac{T_0}{T_{feed}} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4T_0} \omega_{T,0}
$$

$$
\omega_i\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{i,1} = 0
$$

$$
\omega_T\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{T,1} = 0
$$

If $T_{ex}$ is unknown, an energy balance on the heat exchange fluid must be added to either set of design equations. For a liquid-phase system, a momentum balance can be added to the equations above if the pressure drop is significant. If pressure drop is significant in a gas phase system, the momentum balance must be added to the design equations presented earlier in this appendix.
