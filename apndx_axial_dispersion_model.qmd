# Axial Dispersion Reactor Models {#sec-apndx_axial_dispersion}

This appendix starts with the mole and energy balances for an ideal PFR. It adds dispersion terms to allow for mixing of heat and mass in the axial direction, leading to one form of the transient axial dispersion reactor design equations. In anticipation of solving the steady-state versions of those equations numerically, it then shows how the steady state axial dispersion mole and energy balances can be re-written as an equivalent set of first-order differential equations. Conventionally the axial dispersion model is written using the superficial velocity of the fluid in the $z$-direction, $u_z$, but for consistency with the other chapters in *Reaction Engineering Basics* it is written here in terms of the volumetric flow rate.

## Axial Dispersion Reactor Design Equations

The transient mole and energy balances for a PFR are derived in @sec-apndx_ideal_reactor_models. They serve as the starting point for the derivation of the axial dispersion reactor design equations. The assumption of plug flow is retained in the axial dispersion model. The only modification to the PFR mole and energy balances is addition of the term, $-D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d^2C_i}{dz^2}$, to the ideal PFR mole balance, and the term, $-\lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2}$ to the ideal PFR reacting fluid energy balance.

### The Transient Axial Dispersion Mole Balance

The generation of the axial dispersion mole balance begins with ideal PFR mole balance. 

$$
\frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2\dot n_i}{4\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

The dispersion term is added, noting that because $C_i$ varies with both $t$ and $z$, it uses a partial derivative.

$$
\frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2\dot n_i}{4\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

This presents a dilemma because the concentration, $C_i$, is the dependent variable in the axial dispersion term, but the molar flow rate, $\dot{n}_i$, is the dependent variable in the ideal PFR mole balance. Consequently, either the dispersion term must be re-written in terms of the molar flow rate, or, the molar flow rate of the PFR mole balance must be re-written in terms of the concentration. Practically, the axial dispersion mole balance is much more tractable when it is written using the concentration as the dependent variable, so the terms including the molar flow rate need to be re-expressed in terms of the concentration. To do so, both sides of the equation first are multiplied by by $\frac{4}{\pi D^2}$.

$$
\frac{1}{\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\dot n_i}{\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

Noting that $C_i = \frac{\dot{n}_i}{\dot{V}}$ so $\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\dot V} \frac{\partial\dot n_i}{\partial t} - \frac{\dot n_i}{\dot V^2} \frac{\partial \dot V}{\partial t}$ facilitates conversion of the dependent variable in the time derivatives.

$$
\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial \dot n_i}{\partial z} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

Similarly noting that $\dot{n}_i$ = $\dot{V} C_i$ eliminates the molar flow rate as the dependent varibles in the $z$ derivative.

$$
\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left( \dot{V} C_i \right) = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

Accounting rigorously for the change in the volumetric flow rate along the length of the reactor introduces significant mathematical complexity. Instead, it is common to let $\dot{V}$ equal the mean volumetric flow rate, which can be taken outside of the derivative, yielding the more tractable form of the transient axial dispersion mole balance.

$$
\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial t} - D_{ax} \frac{\partial ^2C_i}{\partial z^2} + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

### The Transient Axial Dispersion Energy Balance

The generation of the energy balance begins with the ideal PFR reacting fluid energy balance.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\pi D^2}{4 \dot{V}} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \pi DU\left( T_{ex} - T \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

The dispersion term is added, again noting that because $T$ varies with both $t$ and $z$, a partial derivative is used.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\pi D^2}{4 \dot{V}} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} -\lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \pi DU\left( T_{ex} - T \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

Both sides of the equation can then be multiplied by $\frac{4}{\pi D^2}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\dot{V}} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - \lambda_{ax} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + \frac{4}{\pi D^2} \left( \sum_i \dot{n}_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \frac{4U}{D} \left( T_{ex} - T \right) -  \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

Noting that $\dot{n}_i$ = $\dot{V} C_i$ allows elimination of the molar flow rate, and after doing so, $\dot{V}$ can be factored out of the summations yielding the desired form of the axial dispersion energy balance.

$$
\begin{align}
\left( \sum_i C_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)& \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} - \lambda_{ax} \frac{d^2T}{dz^2} + \frac{4\dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left( \sum_i C_i\hat{C}_{p,i} \right)\frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \\&= \frac{4U}{D} \left( T_{ex} - T \right) -  \sum_j r_j\Delta H_j
\end{align}
$$

### The Steady-State Axial Dispersion Reactor Design Equations.

In this book transient, non-ideal, tubular reactors will not be analyzed. The transient design equations are presented here for the sake of completeness. When the reactor operates at steady-state, all of the time derivatives are equal to zero, and the spatial derivatives become ordinary derivatves.

$$
- D_{ax} \frac{d^2C_i}{dz^2} + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \frac{dC_i}{dz} = \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- \lambda_{ax}\frac{d^2 T}{d z^2} + \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left(\sum_i C_i \hat{C}_{p,i}\right) \frac{d T}{d z} = \frac{4U}{D}\left(T_{ex} - T\right) - \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

If the temperature of the heat exchange fluid is not known, an anergy balance on that fluid needs to be added to the design equations, and if there is pressure drop, a momentum balance must also be added.

### Steady-State Axial Dispersion Model Boundary Conditions

The axial dispersion design conditions include second derivatives of each concentration and of temperature. Solving them then requires two boundary conditions for each concentration and for the temperature. There are a few different ways to write the boundary conditions. The Danckwerts boundary conditions will be presented here.

It is important to note that the concentrations and temperature at the inlet to the reactor (i. e. at $z=0$) will not equal the feed concentrations and temperature, as indicated in @fig-axial_dispersion_inlet. That is, due axial dispersion, there is mixing at the reactor inlet between the feed flow and the fluid within the reactor. 

![Due to mixing in the axial direction, the concentrations and temperature at the inlet are not equal to the feed concentrations and temperature.](Graphics/axial_dispersion_adiabatic.png){#fig-axial_dispersion_inlet width="50%"}

The Danckwerts boundary conditions account for that mixing. (Here it has been assumed that the heat capacities are constant.)

$$
\dot{V}C_{i,feed} = \dot{V} C_{i,0} - D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z}\Bigg\vert_{z=0}
$$

$$
\dot{V}\sum_i\left(C_{i,feed} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) T_{feed} = \dot{V} \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) T_0 - \lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4} \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\Bigg\vert_{z=0}
$$

A second boundary condition is needed for each $C_i$ and for $T$. Because the reactor ends at $z=L$, it can be assumed that the concentrations and temperature will stop changing at that point. Doing so yields the additional boundary conditions.

$$
\frac{\partial C_i}{\partial z}\Bigg\vert_{z=L} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\Bigg\vert_{z=L} = 0
$$

## Equivalent First-Order, Steady-State Design Equations and Boundary Conditions

Recognizing that the design equations will be solved numerically, it is useful to rewrite them as an equivalent set of first-order ODEs. This can be accomplished by defining new variables, $\omega_i$ and $\omega_T$.

$$
\frac{dC_i}{dz} = \omega_i
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dz} = \omega_T
$$

Noting that then $\frac{d^2C_i}{dz^2} = \frac{d\omega_i}{dz}$ and $\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} = \frac{d\omega_T}{dz}$, substitution into the second-order design equations converts them to first-order ODEs.

$$
- D_{ax}\frac{d \omega_i}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\omega_i + \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- \lambda_{ax}\frac{d \omega_T}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left(\sum_i C_i \hat{C}_{p,i}\right) \omega_T + \frac{4U}{D}\left(T_{ex} - T\right) - \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

The boundary conditions must also be expressed in terms of the new variables. Substitution in the Danckwerts boundary conditions and rearrangement yields their equivalent first-order forms.

$$
C_{i,0} = C_{i,feed} + D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4 \dot{V}} \omega_{i,0}
$$

$$
T_0 =  T_{feed} + \lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot{V} \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)} \omega_{T,0}
$$

Similarly, substitution in the boundary conditions at $z=L$ yields the equivalent boundary conditions for the first-order design equations.

$$
\omega_i\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{i,1} = 0
$$

$$
\omega_T\Big\vert_{z=L} = \omega_{T,1} = 0
$$

## Axial Dispersion Design Equations as CVODEs

The axial dispersion model reactor design equations are CVODEs (see @sec-apndx_solve_cvodes). In particular, the initial values, $\omega_{i,0}$ and $\omega_{T,0}$, are coupled implicitly to their final values, $\omega_{i,1}$ and $\omega_{T,1}$.

$$
\left(\omega_{i,0},\, \omega_{T,0}\right) \,:\, \omega_{i,1} = 0
$$

$$
\left(\omega_{i,0},\, \omega_{T,0}\right) \,:\, \omega_{T,1} = 0
$$

If the reacting fluid is an incompressible liquid, then the average volumetric flow rate is equal to the feed volumetric flow rate.

$$
\dot{V} = \dot{V}_{feed} \qquad \text{liquid}
$$

However if the reacting fluid is an ideal gas, the average volumetric flow rate is coupled to the outlet concentrations, temperature, and pressure.

$$
\dot{V} = \frac{\dot{V}_{feed} + \dot{V}_1}{2} = \frac{\dot{V}_{feed} + \frac{RT_1}{P_1}\sum_i \dot{n}_{i,1}}{2} = \frac{\dot{V}_{feed} + \frac{RT_1}{P_1}\sum_i \left(\dot{V} C_{i,1}\right)}{2}= \frac{\dot{V}_{feed} + \dot{V}\frac{RT_1}{P_1}\sum_i  C_{i,1}}{2}
$$

$$
\dot{V} = \frac{\dot{V}_{feed}}{2 - \frac{RT_1}{P_1}\sum_i C_{i,1}} \qquad \text{ideal gas}
$$

## Summary

The axial dispersion mole and energy balances can be written as the following set of first-order CVODEs. If there is pressure drop in the reactor the PFR momentum balance should be added to the design equations. If the design equations include an energy balance on a heat exchange fluid, it will be an ATE that can be solved simultaneously with the coupled value equations.

$$
- D_{ax}\frac{d \omega_i}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2}\omega_i + \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
- \lambda_{ax}\frac{d \omega_T}{d z} = - \frac{4 \dot{V}}{\pi D^2} \left(\sum_i C_i \hat{C}_{p,i}\right) \omega_T + \frac{4U}{D}\left(T_{ex} - T\right) - \sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

$$
\frac{dC_i}{dz} = \omega_i
$$

$$
\frac{dT}{dz} = \omega_T
$$

The initial values of each $\omega_i$ and of $\omega_T$ are coupled values that can be found by solving the following implicit coupled value equations using an ATE solver.

$$
\left(\omega_{i,0},\, \omega_{T,0}\right) \,:\, \omega_{i,1} = 0
$$

$$
\left(\omega_{i,0},\, \omega_{T,0}\right) \,:\, \omega_{T,1} = 0
$$

The remaining initial values and the average volumetric flow rate then can be calculated as follows.

$$
C_{i,0} = C_{i,feed} + D_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4 \dot{V}} \omega_{i,0}
$$

$$
T_0 =  T_{feed} + \lambda_{ax} \frac{\pi D^2}{4\dot{V} \sum_i\left(C_{i,0} \hat{C}_{p,i} \right)} \omega_{T,0}
$$

$$
\dot{V} = \dot{V}_{feed} \qquad \text{liquid}
$$

$$
\dot{V} = \frac{\dot{V}_{feed}}{2 - \frac{RT_1}{P_1}\sum_i C_{i,1}} \qquad \text{ideal gas}
$$

Then, knowing the initial value of every dependent variable and the average volumetric flow rate, the axial dispersion design equations can be solved using an IVODE solver.
