<p>This chapter examines reaction engineering of single, isolated, batch stirred-tank reactors (BSTRs). It examines properties, advantages and disadvantages of BSTRs, common situations where BSTRs are used, the operation of BSTRs, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of BSTRs. It concludes with examples of reaction engineering assignments involving BSTRs.</p>

<p>The two most important characteristics of a BSTR are that (a) the reacting fluid within it is perfectly mixed, and (b) there is no flow of reagents into or out of a BSTR while it is operating. As the name batch <em>stirred tank</em> reactor suggests, the most common physical form of a BSTR for chemical processing is a stirred tank. As indicated in the schematic representations in <a href="#fig-bstr_heat_exchange_schematics">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.1</span></a>, they are typically cylindrical in shape, completely containing the reacting fluid (indicated by blue shading) within rigid walls. When processing liquids, there may be some space at the top of the reactor that does not contain reacting fluid. This is referred to as headspace; it is indicated by gray shading in figure. There must be some means of thoroughly and rapidly mixing the reacting fluid. Commonly an agitator is immersed in the reacting fluid for this purpose.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>If it is necessary to heat or cool the reactor, a heat exchange fluid (indicated by yellow shading in the figure) may flow in and out of the the reactor during operation, but the heat exchange fluid is physically separated from the reacting fluid. <a href="#fig-bstr_heat_exchange_schematics">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.1</span></a> depicts three common configurations for exchange of heat with an external fluid. One (a in the figure) is referred to as a shell or jacket. It is a compartment that surrounds the reacting fluid and has an external heat exchange fluid flowing through it. Another (b in the figure) consists of a coil of tubing that is submerged in the reacting fluid. The heat exchange fluid flows within the coil. The third (c in the figure) is an external heat exchanger. With the latter configuration it is important that the reacting fluid circulates through the heat exchanger rapidly so that the assumption of perfect mixing of the reacting fluid is satisfied. In all three configurations, it is possible that the exchange fluid temperture is not uniform. Nonetheless, in <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> it is always assumed that the heat exchange fluid (within the shell, coil or external heat exchanger) is perfectly mixed.</p>
<p>Stirred tanks are not often used for the processing of gases or when a solid catalyst is being used because stirring gases or small solids praticles is difficult. However, configurations different from a stirred tank can be modeled as BSTRs as long as the critical assumptions are met (perfect mixing and no reagent flow in or out of the reactor). <a href="section_4_bstr_data_analysis.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;9</span></a> describes a few laboratory BSTRs that are not stirred tanks. Similarly, any reactor in a chemical processing facility that conforms to the assumptions used when deriving the BSTR design equations can be modeled as a BSTR. Heat can be added or removed from a reactor in ways that do not involve an exchange fluid. For example, an electric resistance heating element might be used to add heat. <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> only considers heat transfer to or from an external heat exchange fluid.</p>
<p>There are <strong>advantages to using a BSTR</strong>, as opposed to the other types of ideal reactors, particularly the flow reactors (CSTRs and PFRs). BSTRs offer flexibility both in terms of the reactions being run and in the details of operating the process. In a situation where the demand for products is too small to warrant continuous production, a batch reactor might be used to make one product for a few weeks, and then be used to make a different product for the next few weeks. This kind of flexibility avoids having the reactor sit idle for extended periods of time. Similarly, if the production of a product involves heating to and holding at two or more different temperatures during processing, it may be easier to produce it in a batch reactor than to set up a chain of continuous reactors operating at the necessary temperatures. Similarly, if the addition of one reagent needs to be delayed, it <em>may</em> be possible to do so using a BSTR as described below under BSTR Operation. Again, this may be preferred over two continuous reactors operating in series with that reagent added to the second reactor. In contrast to PFRs, the heat transfer area per volume of reacting fluid can be varied over a wide range of values at the time of design. Even after the reactor has been constructed, the length of a submerged coil or the area of an external heat exchanger can be changed if additional heat transfer capability is needed.</p>
<p>There are also <strong>disadvantages to using BSTRs</strong>. As described below, the operation of a BSTR includes periods of time during which no reaction is taking place. Compared to reactors like CSTRs and PFRs that run continuously, this can lead to a lower net rate of reaction. Additionally, the operation of a BSTR is more labor intensive than operation of a continuous reactor. This adds to the cost of production, meaning a higher selling price is necessary in order to make a profit. Another issue with batch processes is that of batch-to-batch consistency. As an example, consider the batch production of an expensive perfume. It is critically imporant that every batch smells the same. Consequently, in addition to being labor intensive, batch processing requires well-trained operators who are careful to precisely follow the specified operational procedure and not deviate from it. Food and beverage production similarly demand high batch-to-batch consistency. This can be even more challenging if, as an example, the process utilizes agricultural reagents that can vary from season to season or year to year.</p>
<p>In light of their advantages and disadvantages, <strong>BSTRs are often used to produce value-added products</strong>. These are products for which the market demand is smaller, but the price, and therefore the profit per pound, is greater. This is in contrast to commodity products where the demand for large quantities is high, but the price per pound is relatively small. High volume production is usually performed in a continuous reactor (CSTR or PFR).</p>

<h2 data-number="13.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bstr-operation"><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> BSTR Operation</h2>
<p>By definition, reaction does not take place continuously in a batch reactor. Before reaction can take place, the reactor must first be cleaned (or, in some cases, sterilized) to remove anything “left behind” by the last reaction that was run. Then the reactants must be prepared and charged into the reactor. From this point on, the operation is much like a cooking recipe. A prescribed series of heating and cooling steps is followed, with reaction taking place during every step. A simple example might be that after the reactants are charged, the reactor is heated to a specified temperature, held at that temperature for a specified length of time, and then cooled back to room temperature. In almost all situations, the reaction has ceased by the end of the last step, either because one of the reactants has been fully consumed or because the temperature has been lowered to the point where the rate is effectively zero. The last step in the operating protocol then is to remove the product from the reactor. Often it is transferred to a holding tank from which it can be sent elsewhere for further processing, purification, or longer term storage.</p>
<p>Of course, the operational protocol, i. e. the “recipe,” could be more complicated, requiring any number of steps. In some cases the operational protocol might call for the addition of a reagent. As long as that reagent is added instantaneously and all at once, the reactor can be analyzed as a BSTR. However, if the reagent is added over time as reactions continue to occur, the reactor is no longer a BSTR and that phase of processing must be analzyed as a semi-batch reactor (<a href="section_5_sbstr_analysis.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;14</span></a>).</p>
<p>It is very important to recognize that the productivity of the reactor, that is the amount of product it produces per hour, must be calculated taking the so-called <em>turnaround time</em> into account. That is, one must include the time needed to clean, fill and drain the reactor, not just the length of time reaction takes place. Doing so permits the definition of the net rate of generation of reagent <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> given in <a href="#eq-bstr_net_rate">Equation&nbsp;<span>13.1</span></a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-bstr_net_rate"><span class="math display">\[
r_{i,net} = \frac{n_i - n_{i,0}}{t_{rxn} + t_{turn}}
\tag{13.1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Even if the turnaround time was zero, it would still be desirable to define a net rate as above. The net rate is useful for characterizing the overall process. As the reaction is progressing, the rate of reaction is continually changing because the temperature and composition are changing. The rate of reaction at any one time during the processing is referred to as the instantaneous rate at that time. The net rate defined in <a href="#eq-bstr_net_rate">Equation&nbsp;<span>13.1</span></a> is a kind of average of the instantaneous rate over the processing time. Similarly, it is sometimes useful to differentiate between overall and instantaneous values of other quantities such as yields, conversions, selectivities, etc.</p>

<h2 data-number="13.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="qualitative-analysis-of-reaction-in-a-bstr"><span class="header-section-number">13.3</span> Qualitative Analysis of Reaction in a BSTR</h2>
<p>A simple process for the qualitative analysis of a reacting system was presented in <a href="section_5_reaction_engineering_tasks.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a>. In a BSTR, there are no spatial variations in temperature or composition because the reactor is perfectly mixed. Therefore, qualitative analysis of a BSTR is used to determine how temperature, reaction rate, composition and related quantities (conversion, selectivity) vary with reaction time.</p>
<p>For purposes of illustration, suppose the typical, irreversible, exothermic reaction, <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow Z\)</span> takes place in an isothermal BSTR. In this situation, only the concentrations need to be considered because in an isothermal reactor the temperature does not change. At the start of the process, the concentration of A will be high and that of Z will be small or zero. During a very small interval of time at the start of the process the concentration of A will decrease and the concentration of Z will increase due to the reaction starting to take place. Hence, in a plot of reactant concentration versus reaction time, the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept will be high and the slope at that point will be negative. For the product, the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept will be low or zero and the initial slope will be positive.</p>
<p>The changes in composition will affect the reaction rate. For a typical, irreversible reaction, the decrease in the reactant concentration will tend to decrease the rate while the increase in the product concentration will not affect it. Consequently, at the end of that small interval of reaction time, the rate will be smaller.</p>
<p>In the next small interval of time, the concentration of the reactant, A, will decrease by less than it did in the first interval because the rate is lower. For the same reason, the concentration of the product, Z, will increase by less than it did during the first interval of time. In terms of graphs showing the concentrations versus time, then, the concentration of the reactant, A, will start high with a negative slope and a curvature that is concave upward. That is, the slope will become less steep as the reaction time increases. In like manner, a graph showing the concentration of Z versus reaction time will start at or near zero with a positive slope and a curvature that is concave downward (i. e. the slope will get less steep as the reaction time increases).</p>
<p>If that initial behavior continued througout the process, the concentration of the reactant would decrease with a smaller and smaller slope until finally reaching a horizontal plateau at a value of zero (because the reaction is irreversible and therefor goes to completion). The concentration of the product would increase with a smaller and smaller slope until finally reaching a plateau at a value equal to the initial concentration of A (because the stoichiometry is 1 Z per A). The results of this qualitative analysis are shown in <a href="#fig-qualitative_iso_batch_profiles">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.2</span></a>.</p>

<p>The qualitative analysis here was straightforward because the reactor was isothermal. In <a href="#sec-example_13_1">Example&nbsp;<span>13.7.1</span></a> the qualitative analysis of an adiabatic BSTR is presented. That analysis is more complicated because both concentrations and temperature are changing. In fact, the changes in composition and temperature, taken separately, would affect the rate in opposite ways. As a consequence there is greater uncertainty in the results.</p>

<h2 data-number="13.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bstr-design-equations"><span class="header-section-number">13.4</span> BSTR Design Equations</h2>
<p>The reactor design equations for BSTRs were presented in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;6</span></a>. The BSTR mole and energy balances shown below were presented in Equations <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_mole_balance"><span>6.8</span></a> and <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_energy_balance"><span>6.9</span></a>. That chapter also presents the energy balances shown below for a heat exchange fluid that transfers sensible heat, <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-exchange_energy_bal_sensible">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.2</span></a>, and one that transfers latent heat, <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-exchange_energy_bal_latent">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.6</span></a>. <a href="section_3_design_equations.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;6</span></a> also describes how to select the specific reactor design equations needed to model BSTRs under different circumstances. That discussion will not be duplicated here.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\sum_i n_i \hat C_{p,i} \right) \frac{dT}{dt} - V\frac{dP}{dt}  - P  \frac{dV}{dt}  = \dot Q - \dot W - V \sum_j \left(r_j \Delta H_j \right)
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \tilde C_{p,ex}\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\dot Q - \dot m_{ex} \int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \tilde C_{p,ex}dT

<p><span class="math display">\[

\]</span></p>
<p>The design equations can often be simplified. As noted in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;6</span></a>, if the reactor walls are rigid (or if an ideal, incompressible liquid is being processed) then the volume, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, will be constant and its time derivative, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\)</span>, will equal zero. If the work associated with agitation is negligible (it usually is) and there are no other shafts or moving boundaries, then the rate at which the reacting fluid performs work, <span class="math inline">\(\dot W\)</span>, on its surroundings is also equal to zero. When an ideal, incompressible liquid is being processed, the pressure, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, is constant and its time derivative, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\)</span>, is equal to zero. Finally, for liquids, <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_equivalent_sens_heat_terms">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.10</span></a> showed how the sensible heat term in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a> can be expressed in terms of the mass-specific or volume-specific heat capacity of the solution as a whole instead of the individual molar heat capacities.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\sum_i n_i \hat C_{p,i} \right) \frac{dT}{dt}\ \Leftrightarrow\ \rho V \tilde C_p \frac{dT}{dt}\ \Leftrightarrow\ V \breve C_p \frac{dT}{dt}
\]</span></p>
<p>When rate expressions are substituted into the BSTR mole and energy balances, they typically introduce concentrations or partial pressures of reagents. When the design equations are solved, those concentrations and partial pressures must be expressed in terms of the molar amounts of the reagents. The concentration is simply the molar amount divided by the volume, <a href="section_1_intro_and_defs.html#eq-concentration_closed">Equation&nbsp;<span>1.7</span></a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
C_i = \frac{n_i}{V}
\]</span></p>
<p>For ideal gases, the partial pressure is related to the molar amount through the ideal gas law, <a href="section_1_intro_and_defs.html#eq-partial_pressure">Equation&nbsp;<span>1.12</span></a>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P_i = \frac{n_iRT}{V}
\]</span></p>
<p>When heat transfer involves an exchange fluid as shown in <a href="#fig-bstr_heat_exchange_schematics">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.1</span></a>, the rate of heat exchange in the energy balances can be calculated using <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_heat_transfer">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.18</span></a>. If the reactor operates adiabatically (i. e. it is perfectly insulated and does not have a shell, coil or external heat exchanger as in <a href="#fig-bstr_heat_exchange_schematics">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.1</span></a>), <span class="math inline">\(\dot{Q}\)</span> is equal to zero.</p>

<p><a href="section_5_reaction_engineering_tasks.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a> described how to identify a reaction engineering assignment that involves the modeling of an isolated ideal reactor and suggested that such assignments can be completed in five basic steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Summarize the information provided in the assignment.</li>
<li>Formulate the solution mathematically.</li>
<li>Implement the solution numerically.</li>
<li>Execute the solution.</li>
<li>Report and comment upon the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>This section describes the application of that approach to the modeling of an isolated BSTR. The process may seem a bit abstract when first read, but it should become clearer after seeing it used in the examples provided at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>Often the operational protocol for a BSTR has multiple heating and cooling steps. When this is true, each step of the protocol can be analyzed separately from the other steps. The reactor design equations for BSTRs are initial value ordinary differential equations (IVODEs), and the steps occur sequentially. Consequently the values of the independent and dependent variables at the end of one step in the operating protocol become the initial values for the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Summarizing the information provided in the assignment</strong>. When learning reaction engineering, assignments are often presented as a written narrative that describes the reactor, reactions, and tasks associated with the assignment. When completing the assignment, it is useful to read through that narrative and make a concise listing of the information it provides. Specifically, it is useful to note that the reactor is a BSTR and to indicate its operational mode as either isothermal, adiabatic, or neither. As the narrative is read, each time a numerical value is encountered, an appropriate variable symbol should be chosen to represent it (for example <span class="math inline">\(n_{A,0}\)</span> for the initial number of moles of reagent A), and the variable should be set equal to the given value in the narative and added to the summary.</p>
<p>If the narrative indicates that a quantity of interest should be plotted, tabulated, minimized, or maximized, with respect to other, adjusted variables, that means that the reactor model will need to be solved multiple times using a range of values of the adjusted variables. When summarizing the information provided in the assignment, it can be helpful to identify the adjusted variables.</p>
<p>The reactor design equations for a BSTR are IVODEs. In order to numerically solve the BSTR reactor design equations all of the reactor inputs (initial molar amounts, initial temperature, exchange fluid mass flow rate, and inlet exchange fluid temperature) and all of the process parameters other than the reaction time (reacting fluid volume, heat transfer area and, heat transfer coefficient) must be known. In other words, every constant quantity appearing in the design equations <em>and</em> the initial values of the dependent variables <em>must</em> be known. The design equations can then be solved for the reactor outputs (final molar amounts, final temperature, and outlet exchange fluid temperature or fraction of exchange fluid that changes phase). Then quantities related to the reactor outputs like the conversion, final concentration, final selectivity, etc. can be calculated.</p>
<p>However, some assignments specify the value of one reactor output or related response and task the engineer with finding the reactor input or process parameter that will result in that reactor output. If, while reading through the assignment narrative, it is noticed that a necessary reactor input or process parameter is missing and a reactor output or related response is specified, the missing quantity and the specified response should be included in the summary of information provided in the assignment. If this is not noticed at this point, it will become apparent when mathematically formulating the solution, and the missing input/parameter and the specified response can be added to the summary at that point.</p>
<p>Finally, the summary of information provided in the assighment should list every quantity of interest in the assignment. That is, it should list the quantities that are requested in the assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Formulating the solution mathematically</strong>. It is necessary to solve the BSTR reactor design equations when completing an isolated BSTR modeling assignment. Selecting which equations are needed to model a given BSTR and simplifying those design equations was described in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;6</span></a> and in the preceding section of this chapter.</p>
<p>The design equations for an isolated BSTR will be a set of IVODEs. The independent variable will be the elapsed time since the start of processing, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The dependent variables will be the molar amounts of the reagents present in the system, <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span>, the temperature of the reacting fluid, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, (assuming an energy balance is needed to model the BSTR), and either the outlet temperature of the exchange fluid, <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex}\)</span>, or the fraction of the exchange fluid that undergoes phase change, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> (assuming an exchange fluid energy balance is needed to model the BSTR).</p>
<p>However, if the reacting fluid is a gas and the reactor design equations include an energy balance on the reacting fluid, the pressure will aslo appear as a dependent variable. A set of IVODEs can only be solved if the number of IVODEs is equal to the number of dependent variables. Consequently, when a reacting fluid energy balance is being used and the reacting fluid is a gas, another equation is needed. In <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> gases are always assumed to be ideal, and a differential form of the ideal gas law, <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-differential_ideal_gas_law">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.11</span></a>, is needed. This equation can either be added to the reactor design equations, making the number of equations equal to the number of dependent variables, or it can be used to eliminate <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\)</span> from the energy balance, so that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is no longer a dependent variable.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P \frac{dV}{dt} + V \frac{dP}{dt} - R \left( T \sum_i \frac{dn_i}{dt} + \left( \sum_i n_i \right) \frac{dT}{dt} \right) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>Typically <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> is defined to be the instant the reagents were charged into the BSTR. To solve the BSTR design equations, the value of every dependent variable at that instant must be specified and calculated. Additionally, the value of either <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> or one of the dependent variables at the end of the first step in the operating protocol must be specified and calculated. This is called the stopping criterion. When the operational protocol involves multiple steps, the reactor design equations can be written and solved separately for each step. Since the steps occur sequentially with each one immediately following the one before it, final values of the independent and dependent variables in one step become the initial values for the next step.</p>
<p>In addition to providing initial values and a stopping criterion, every quantity that appears in the design equations or in an equation that is substituted into the design equations, must be expressed in terms of known constants, the independent variable, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the dependent variables. While doing this, it will become apparent if there is a missing reactor input or process parameter, and if the missing quantity was not identified when the information provided in the assignment was summarized it can be added to the summary together with the reactor response that is specified in the assignment. During mathematical formulation of the solution, the adjusted quantities and the missing value are treated as known constants.</p>
<p>After specifying the initial values and stopping criterion and expressing all quantities in the design equations in terms of known constants, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and the dependent variables, the reactor design equations can be solved numerically. Doing so will yield a set of times from the start to the end of processing and corresponding sets of values of each of the dependent variables at those times. Equations must be provided that use those to calculate all of the quantities of interest <em>and</em> the value of the specified response, if there is one.</p>
<p>Finally, making specific reference to each equation written during the mathematical formulation, the sequence of calculations that need to be performed to find the values of the quantities of interest <em>and</em> the specified response (if there is one) should be briefly explained or outlined. This should include any processing of the quantities of interest such as plotting, finding a minimum or maximum value, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Implementing the solution numerically</strong>. In <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em> two computer functions are always created when implementing the solution of an isolated BSTR modeling assignment numerically. The first function is called the <strong>response function</strong>. The response function solves the reactor design equations and uses the results to calculate the quantities of interest and the specified response, if there is one. It then returns the quantities of interest and the specified response, if there is one. If there are sets of adjusted quantities, it does that for each set of adjusted quantities, and it returns the corresponding quantities of interest and specified responses for each of the sets of adjusted quantities.</p>
<p>Depending upon the nature of the assignment, the response function may receive 0, 1, or 2 arrguments as input. If there are sets of adjusted quantities, they are passed to the response function as a matrix where each row of the matrix contains one set of adjusted quantities and the columns correspond to the individual adjusted quantities. If there is a missing reactor input or process parameter, it is passed to the response function as a separate argument. (If there are sets of adjusted quantities, then a corresponding set of missing values are passed to the response function as a vector argument.).</p>
<p>Within the response function, variables representing each known, constant are defined first. The response function then loops through the sets of adjusted quantities. Each time through the loop it solves the design equations numerically, calculates the quantities of interest (and the specified response, if there is one), and saves the results. Once the loop is completed, the response function returns the quantities of interest (and specified response, if there is one) for all of the sets of adjusted quantities.</p>
<p>The other function that is created when implementing the solution numerically is called the <strong>calculations function</strong>. Its purpose is to perform the sequence of calculations that must be used to calculate the quantities of interest and process them as needed to complete the assignment. If the assignment provides all of the necessary reactor inputs and process parameters, then the calculations function simply calls the response function to get the quantities of interest and then processes them (i.e.&nbsp;plots them, identifies a maximum value, etc.) as necessary to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>If there is a missing reactor input or process parameter, the calculations function must use response function to create a function that evaluates the residual, <a href="section_5_reaction_engineering_tasks.html#eq-resp_func_as_residual_eqn">Equation&nbsp;<span>12.2</span></a>. It then must pass that function to an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE) solver along with a guess for the missing value. The ATE solver returns the missing reactor input or process parameter. The calculations function can then call the response function directly, passing the missing missing reactor input or process parameter as a argument. The quantities of interest are returned by the response function and processed as necessary to complete the assignment.</p>

<h2 data-number="13.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bstr-design-objectives"><span class="header-section-number">13.6</span> BSTR Design Objectives</h2>
<p>As noted in <a href="section_5_reaction_engineering_tasks.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a>, design assignments typically do not fully specify the reactor system or its operation. They require the engineer find a set of system and process specifications that optimize some financial objective such as maximizing the rate of profit. That can entail calculation of fixed and operating costs, etc. together with reactor modeling. These types of design problems are beyond the scope of <em>Reaction Engineering Basics</em>. However, for illustrative purposes, reactor and process parameters can be used as indicators of these costs. For an isolated BSTR a few of the reactor and process parameters that might be used as economic indicators include the system volume (smaller is better), the processing time (shorter is better), the net production rate, <a href="#eq-bstr_net_rate">Equation&nbsp;<span>13.1</span></a>, (larger is better), heat requirements (smaller is better), and selectivity or yield of one of the products. These indicators can be minimized or maximized using other reactor and process parameters including initial composition, temperature, reaction time, etc. Design assignments involving BSTRs are considered in <a href="section_5_non_continuous_design.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;15</span></a>.</p>

<p>The examples in this section illustrate the analysis of isolated BSTRs. Examples <a href="#sec-example_13_1"><span>13.7.1</span></a> and <a href="#sec-example_13_2"><span>13.7.2</span></a> are <strong>response assignments</strong> where the assignment specifies a sufficient number of quantities so that the reactor design equations can be solved to find the quantities of interest. In <a href="#sec-example_13_1">Example&nbsp;<span>13.7.1</span></a> all necessary reactor inputs and process parameters are specified and the quantities of interest are related to reactor outputs. In <a href="#sec-example_13_2">Example&nbsp;<span>13.7.2</span></a> a reactor output is specified (the conversion), and one of the unknown quantities of interest is a reactor input (the initial temperature). In addition to illustrating the computational procedure for these two types of response tasks, <a href="#sec-example_13_1">Example&nbsp;<span>13.7.1</span></a> involves a single reaction taking place in an adiabatic BSTR while <a href="#sec-example_13_2">Example&nbsp;<span>13.7.2</span></a> features two reactions taking place in a BSTR that is cooled using an exchange fluid. Examples <a href="#sec-example_13_3"><span>13.7.3</span></a> and <a href="#sec-example_13_4"><span>13.7.4</span></a> are <strong>optimization assignments</strong> that identify a reactor variable that must be maximized or minimized by specifying a reactor input. The computational procedure for solving optimization problems differs slightly from the procedures for solving response problems. The BSTR operational protocol in <a href="#sec-example_13_3">Example&nbsp;<span>13.7.3</span></a>, like those in Examples <a href="#sec-example_13_1"><span>13.7.1</span></a> and <a href="#sec-example_13_2"><span>13.7.2</span></a>, consists of a single step. <a href="#sec-example_13_4">Example&nbsp;<span>13.7.4</span></a> illustrates a situation where there are multiple steps in the operating protocol. It also considers turnaround time and the net rate of reaction.</p>

The reactor is adiabatic, so the rate of heat input, <span class="math inline">\(\dot{Q}\)</span>, is equal to zero.

<p>I know that the purpose of the response function is to calculate the quantities of interest. In this assignment there isn’t a missing reactor input or process parameters. That means that the response function will not have a missing value argument.</p>
<p>There is an adjusted value, namely <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. However, in this assignment I do not need to pass a range of values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to the response function because the IVODE solver will generate a range of values between <span class="math inline">\(t = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{rxn}\)</span> as it solves the IVODEs.</p>
<p>When IVODEs are solved numerically, analytic expressions for the dependent variables as functions of the dependent variables (e. g. <span class="math inline">\(n_A\left(t\right)\)</span>) are not obtained. Instead the solution takes the form of a vector containing values of the independent variable and vectors containing corresponding values of the dependent variables. Hence, the response function must complete the first seven steps in the sequence given above and then return a vector containing the range of values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and vectors containing the correponding values of <span class="math inline">\(C_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C_B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C_Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C_Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>

<li>In preparation for solving the IVODEs, it defines a function to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_A}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_B}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_Y}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_Z}{dt}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{dt}\)</span> using equations (3) through (7).

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The concentrations of the reactants, A and B, decrease monotonically during the first two hours of operation while the concentrations of the products, Y and Z, increase. The temperature increases steadily, too. The variation of the reaction rate is different. Initially it increases, but then it passes through a maximum after which it steadily decreases.</p>
<p><strong>Qualitative Analysis</strong></p>
<p>A qualitative analysis shows that the variations in the concentrations, temperature and rate seen in Figures <a href="#fig-example_13_1_concentrations"><span>13.3</span></a>, <a href="#fig-example_13_1_temperatures"><span>13.4</span></a>, and <a href="#fig-example_13_1_rates"><span>13.5</span></a> are expected. At <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>, the concentrations of the reagents and the temperature are all at their initial values. At this point the rate has the corresponding value calculated using equations (8), (9), (10), and (2).</p>
<p><strong>After a short interval</strong> of time, since the rate is positive, the concentrations of A and B will have decreased slightly and the concentration of Y and Z will have increased slightly due to the occurrence of the reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic and the reactor operates adiabatically, the temperature will have increased due to the heat released by the reaction. The rate could either increase or decrease during this short interval. The concentrations of the reactants, A and B, are decreasing, and this alone would cause the rate to decrease. However, at the same time the temperature is increasing, and that alone would cause the rate to increase. Generally the exponential dependence of the rate upon the temperature will be stronger than its dependence upon the reactant concentrations, and the rate will increase. This is seen to be the case in <a href="#fig-example_13_1_rates">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.5</span></a>. (Had the heat of reaction been very small, leading to a small increase in the temperature, it is possible that the rate would have decreased, especially if the activation was also small).</p>
<p><em>During that initial short interval of time, the concentrations of Y and Z, the temperature, and the rate all have positive slopes while the concentrations of A and B have negative slopes</em>. <strong>During the next short interval of time</strong>, the rate is larger than during the first interval of time. As a consequence, <em>the concentrations and temperature will change more during the second interval</em>. Thus, <em>the curvature of temperature, Y concentration, and Z concentration profiles is initially concave upward and the curvature of the A and B concentration profiles is initially concave downward</em>. Again during this interval, opposing effects are associated with the decreasing reactant concentrations and the increasing temperature.</p>
<p>The initial curvature of the concentration and temperature profiles is very slight and can’t really be discerned in <a href="#fig-example_13_1_concentrations">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.3</span></a> and <a href="#fig-example_13_1_temperatures">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.4</span></a>. Nonetheless, <strong>the initial curvature must change at some later time</strong>. Initially the concentrations of A and B are decreasing faster and faster and the concentrations of Y and Z and the temperature are increasing faster and faster. These trends cannot continue indefinitely, if they did, <span class="math inline">\(C_Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C_Z\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> would approach positive infinity and <span class="math inline">\(C_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_B\)</span> would approach negative infinity.</p>
<p>In fact, the curvature does change because <strong>at some point the effect of decreasing reactant concentrations upon the rate becomes stronger than the effect of increasing temperature</strong>. At the point where the two effects become equal, the rate reaches a maximum. Beyond the maximum, the effect of decreasing reactant concentration dominates and the rate decreases. This is seen in <a href="#fig-example_13_1_rates">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.5</span></a> where the instantaneous rate passes through a maximum.</p>
<p>At the point where the rate reaches its maximum value, the concentration and temperature profiles exhibit an inflection point. (Again, in this example this is very, very subtle and cannot be discerned in the figures.) Beyond that point, the <span class="math inline">\(C_Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C_Z\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> profiles are concave downward and the <span class="math inline">\(C_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_B\)</span> are concave upward. That is, the changes over time become smaller and smaller. This behavior can continue indefinitely. Eventually the concentrations and temperature will stop changing and become constant. In this example, A is the limiting reactant, and the reaction is irreversible, so the concentrations and temperature will become constant when <span class="math inline">\(C_A\)</span> becomes equal to zero.</p>

<p>Mole balances are always included in the design equations, and for a BSTR the mole balance is given by <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_mole_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.8</span></a>. In this system, there are two reactions taking place, so the summation expands to two terms.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j = \nu_{i,1}r_1V + \nu_{i,2}r_2V

<p>The BSTR is not isothermal, so an energy balance on the reacting fluid, <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a>, is required. There are no shafts or moving boundaries (other than the agitator which is assumed to do negligible work), so the rate of doing work, <span class="math inline">\(\dot{W}\)</span>, is zero. The reacting fluid is a liquid, so the pressure is constant and its time-derivative is zero. Assuming it to be an incompressible ideal mixture means that the volume also is constant, and the time-derivative of the volume is equal to zero. The assignment provides a mass-specific heat capacity, so the sensible heat term can be written in terms of that instead of molar heat capacities. Since there are two reactions, the final summation expands to two terms.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>The exchange fluid heat capacity is constant, making the evaluation of the integral trivial.</p>

<p>The reactor design equations are a set of seven IVODEs. The independent variable is <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and the dependent variables are <span class="math inline">\(n_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex}\)</span>. There are seven IVODEs and seven dependent variables, so no other IVODEs are needed. However, initial values and a stopping criterion <em>are</em> needed in order to solve IVODEs.</p>
<p>The instant the fluids are mixed in the reactor can be defined as <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. The values of each of the dependent variables at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> must then be used as the initial values for solving the IVODEs The solutions used to charge it contain only A and B; <span class="math inline">\(n_{A,0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{B,0}\)</span> can be used to represent the initial molar amounts of A and B. The initial molar amounts of A and B, <span class="math inline">\(n_{A,0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{B,0}\)</span>, are not given, but they can be calculated from their initial concentrations and the reactor volume, which are given. The initial molar amounts of X, Y, and Z are zero. The reacting fluid temperature at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> is unknown, but <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> can be used to represent it.</p>
<p>Had I not noticed this when I was summarizing the information provided in the assignment, it would be apparent at this point that a necessary reactor input is missing, and I would have gone back to the information summary and added <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> as a missing reactor input. If one of the inputs is missing, then the problem has to specify a reactor output or a response related to one. If it didn’t, there would be too many unknowns (or too few equations) and the assignment couldn’t be completed. Knowing this, I’d have gone through the assignment again looking for a specified output or response. At that point I would see that the assignment specifies the conversion of A and I’d have added it to the information summary.</p>
<p>Returning to the initial values, I still need an initial value for <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex}\)</span>. Notice that <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex}\)</span> is the <strong>outlet</strong> temperature of the exchange fluid, so the necessary initial value is the temperature of the exchange fluid <strong>leaving</strong> the reactor at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. The assignment does not mention the initial <em>outlet</em> temperature of the exchange fluid <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex,0}\)</span>. It only specifies the constant inlet temperature of the exchange fluid. I will assume that the cooling water is flowing before the reagents are added to the reactor, so at the instant they are added, the outlet exchange fluid temperature equals the inlet exchange fluid temperature, <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex,in}\)</span>.</p>
<p>I also need a stopping criterion. This assignment actually provides two pieces of information I could use as a stopping criterion. The assignment is to find responses after a reaction time, <span class="math inline">\(t_{rxn}\)</span>, of 30 min, so that could be used as the stopping criterion. It also specifies the final conversion of A. I could use that to calculate the final molar amount of A and use that as the stopping criterion. When the final value of the independent value is specified, I prefer to use that as the stopping criterion, so I’ll use <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{txn}\)</span> as the stopping criterion. (The problem can be solved using either stopping criterion).</p>

<p>I know that when the design equations are IVODEs and one reactor input or process parameter is missing, the response function serves two purposes. The first is to calculate the value of the specified response given a value for the missing reactor input or process parameter. To do this, the response function must accept the missing value as an argument and it must return the corresponding value of the specified response. The second purpose of the response function is to calculate and return the quantities of interest. In this assignment there aren’t any adjusted quantities, so there won’t be an adjusted value argment passed to the response function.</p>
<p>When IVODEs are solved numerically, analytic expressions for the dependent variables as functions of the dependent variables (e. g. <span class="math inline">\(n_A\left(t\right)\)</span>) are not obtained. Instead the solution takes the form of a vector containing values of the independent variable and vectors containing corresponding values of the dependent variables. In this assignment, the quantities of interest will be the final values in each vector because they correspond to <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{rxn}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The response function will receive a value for <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>. It first must complete the first five steps in the sequence given above. Next it must complete steps 6b, 6c, and 8. Finally, it must return <span class="math inline">\(T\Big\vert_{t_{rxn}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex}\Big\vert_{t_{rxn}}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(S_{X/Z}\Big\vert_{t_{rxn}}\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Response Function</strong></p>
<p>The response function is created with the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>It accepts one argument which it uses as the missing reactor input, <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>.</li>
<li>It begins by defining variables that hold the known and given constants.</li>
<li>It next calculates <span class="math inline">\(n_{A,0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{B,0}\)</span> using equations (12) and (13).</li>
<li>In preparation for solving the IVODEs, it defines a function to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_A}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_B}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_X}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_Y}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_Z}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{dt}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\)</span> using equations (5) through (11).

<li>calculates <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> using equations (3) and (4), and</li>
<li>calculates and returns <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_A}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_B}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_X}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_Y}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dn_Z}{dt}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT}{dt}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt}\)</span> using equations (5) through (11).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The response function next calls an IVODE solver to solve equations (5) through (11) and get values for the final values of <span class="math inline">\(n_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_{ex}\)</span>, passing the function above and the initial values and stopping criterion in <a href="#tbl-example_13_2_initial_values">Table&nbsp;<span>13.2</span></a> as arguments.</li>

They cannot be solved directly for an initial value. To get around this numerical limitation, it was necessary to create a residual equation, equation (21), and first solve it to find the initial value. It still was necessary to solve the IVODEs within that residual function, but at that point a guess for the missing initial value was available and the IVODEs could be solved numerically.

<p>Mole balances are always included in the reactor design equations. The general BSTR mole balance is given in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_mole_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.8</span></a>. I will use this equation to write mole balances for every reagent in the system. That is, I’ll write the mole balance for <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> = A, B, D, Z, and U. There are two reactions taking place, so the sum will expand to two terms in each mole balance.</p>

<p>This reactor is not isothermal, so I will need to include a BSTR reacting fluid energy balance among the reactor design equations. The BSTR energy balance is given in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a>. This reactor has rigid walls and no moving boundaries, so it’s volume is constant. If the volume is constant, the time-derivative of the volume is equal to zero. Being a gas phase system with a constant volume, the pressure is expected to change because the temperature will change. Therefore I <em>cannot</em> set the time-derivative of the pressure equal to zero. With no moving boundaries, the only work is that of the agitator, which is assumed to be negligible. The summation over <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> includes every reagent, and as above, the summation over <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> expands to two terms.</p>

<p>An exchange fluid is present in this reactor, but the assignment states that its temperature is constant at 30 °C. Knowing the exchange fluid temperature, the other reactor design equations can be solved independently of an energy balance on the exchange fluid, so I do not need to include an energy balance on the exchange fluid among the reactor design equations.</p>

<p>I now have 7 IVODEs with 7 dependent variables. Initial values and a stopping criterion are needed in order to solve these equations. I can define <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> to be instant that the A and B are added to the reactor, and let <span class="math inline">\(n_{A,0}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_{B,0}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span> represent the molar amounts of A and B, the pressure, and the temperature at that instant. The initial molar amounts of A and B are not given, but their initial partial pressures are. Consequently, the initial molar amounts of A and B can be calculated using the ideal gas law. Initially the reactor does not contain D, Z, or U, so the initial molar amounts of those reagents are equal to zero. The initial temperature is given and the initial pressure can be calculated using the initial partial pressures of the reagents given in the assignment.</p>
<p>The assignment asks for the reaction time that will maximize the yield, so I need to vary the reaction time over a range of values, as indicated in the information summary. Because the reaction time is the independent variable, I do not need to solve the design equations many times using different values of the reaction time. Instead, I can set the reaction time to a large value and use it as the stopping criterion, <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{rxn}\)</span>. Solving the design equations will yield <span class="math inline">\(n_A\left(t\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_B\left(t\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_D\left(t\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_Z\left(t\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_U\left(t\right)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P\left(t\right)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T\left(t\right)\)</span>, from which I can calculate <span class="math inline">\(Y_{D/A}\left(t\right)\)</span> (see below). If the yield does not exhibit a maximum at times between <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t=t_{rxn}\)</span>, I’ll need to set the reaction time to a larger value and repeat the calculations.</p>

<p>The initial values and stopping criterion for solving equations (5) through (11) are presented in <a href="#tbl-example_13_3_initial_values">Table&nbsp;<span>13.4</span></a>. The initial molar amounts of A and B can be calculated using equations (12) and (13), and the initial total pressure is the sum of the initial partial pressures, equation (14). The reaction time needs to be adjusted to find the time that maximizes the yield. Consequently, a value can be chosen for <span class="math inline">\(t_{rxn}\)</span>. Doing so will yield results that span times from zero to the chosen value when the equations are solved numerically.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Reactions (1) and (2) constitute a series-parallel reaction network. The desired product, D, is an intermediate product. It is produced in reaction (1) and consumed in reaction (2). Assuming that the temperature affects the two reactions equally, the yield of an intermediate product is expected to pass through a maximum as the reaction time increases as seen in <a href="#fig-example_13_3_yield_plot">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.6</span></a>. This can be predicted using a quantitative analysis</p>
<p><strong>Qualitative Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The reason for the maximum is qualitatively easy to understand as long as the effect of temperature is comparable for the two reactions. At the start of the reaction, the concentrations a A and B will be large and those of D, U, and Z will be small. The rate of reaction (1) will be positive while that for reaction (2) will be zero. Consequently, during a very brief interval at the start of the reaction, the concentrations of A and B will decrease and the concentrations of D and Z will increase.</p>
<p>During the next brief interval in time, the rate of reaction (1) will be smaller because the concentrations of A and B will be smaller, and the rate of reaction (2) no longer will equal zero because a small amount D will be present leading to a positive rate. The concentrations of A and B will again decrease and the concentration of Z will again increase. During this second brief interval it can be expected that the rate of reaction (1) will be greater than the rate of reaction (2) because only a small concentration of D will be present. Hence during the second small interval of time, the concentration of D will again increase, as can be seen in <a href="#fig-example_13_3_yield_plot">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.6</span></a>.</p>
<p>For as long as the rate of reaction (2) remains smaller than the rate of reaction (1), the amount of D will be increasing, but its rate of increase will get smaller and smaller. The reason for this is that the concentrations of A and B will be decreasing, and hence the rate of reaction (1) will be decreasing. At the same time, the rate of reaction (2) will be increasing as the concentration of D builds. This can be seen in <a href="#fig-example_13_3_yield_plot">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.6</span></a> where the curvature of the yield plot is initially concave downward,</p>
<p>Eventually, the rate of reaction (2) will become equal to the rate of reaction (1). For that instant in time, the yield of D will not be changing. This corresponds to the maximum in <a href="#fig-example_13_3_yield_plot">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.6</span></a>. At times beyond the maximum the rate of reaction (1) is less than the rate of reaction (2), so the concentration of D decreases. As the concentrations of both reactants, A and D, continue to decrease, both reactions (1) and (2) become slower and slower. This can be seen at larger reaction times in <a href="#fig-example_13_3_yield_plot">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.6</span></a> where the curve is concave upward. Eventually, at very large reaction time, the rates will equal zero and all of the D will have been consumed.</p>

<p>In this example series-parallel reactions are occurring where the desired product is produced in one reaction and consumed by another. In this situation it is often found that the reaction time has the greatest effect upon the amount of the desired product, as was the case here. Other process parameters such as the temperature will also affect the results, but often their effect on the amount of desired product is weaker. Temperature can be an effective parameter for adjusting the selectivity of multiple reactions if the activation energies of the reactions differ significantly.</p>

<p>The rate expression for liquid-phase reaction (1) is given in equation (2). The rate coefficient displays Arrhenius temperature dependence with a pre-exponential factor of 2.59 x 10<sup>9</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> and an activation energy of 16.5 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. The heat of reaction (1) may be taken to be constant and equal to -22,200 cal mol<sup>-1</sup>. A solution containing only A at a concentration of 2 M and a temperature of 23 °C is going to be processed in a BSTR. The heat capacity of the solution is approximately constant and equal to 440 cal L<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, and its density is constant.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
A \rightarrow Z \tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r_1 = k_1C_A \tag{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The 4.0 L BSTR has a perfectly mixed jacket with a volume of 0.5 L, a heat transfer area of 0.6 ft<sup>2</sup>, and a heat transfer coefficient of 1.13 x 10<sup>4</sup> cal ft<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. Cooling water at 20 °C can be fed to the jacket. The water may be taken to have a constant density of 1 g cm<sup>-3</sup> and a constant heat capacity of 1 cal g<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. A heating coil with a heat transfer coefficient of 3.8 x 10<sup>4</sup> cal ft<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> and a heat transfer area of 0.23 ft<sup>2</sup> can be submerged in and extracted from the reacting solution. Saturated steam at 120 °C can admitted to the coil.</p>
<p>The BSTR is charged with 4 L of a 2 M solution of A at 23 °C. Initially there is no flow to the jacket, but it is filled with water, also at 23 °C. To start the batch process, the steam is admitted to the coil, and the coil is immersed in the solution. When the reacting fluid reaches 50 °C, the coil is extracted from the reacting fluid and cooling water flow to the jacket is started. When the reacting fluid reaches a temperature of 25 °C the cooling water flow is stopped, the reactor is drained and preparations for processing the next batch begin. The BSTR pressure is constant throughout all stages of processing. If the turnaround time for the reactor is 25 min, what coolant flow rate will maximize the net rate of production of Z? Plot the conversion of A and the reacting fluid temperature <em>vs</em>. reaction time corresponding to the coolant flow rate that maximizes the net rate and comment on the results.</p>

<p>Using the criteria presented in <a href="section_5_reaction_engineering_tasks.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a>, this is an isolated reactor modeling assignment. The system consists of a BSTR and no other equipment. The reactor and its operation are described. The reaction taking place is indentified and its rate expression is provided, and it asks for a reactor input, namely the coolant flow rate. This is an optimization assignment because the coolant flow rate of interest is the one that maximizes the net rate of production of Z.</p>
<p>Having identified this as an isolated reactor optimization assignment, I know from <a href="section_5_reaction_engineering_tasks.html"><span>Chapter&nbsp;12</span></a> that completing the assignment entails five basic steps.</p>

<li>Formulate the solution mathematically.</li>
<li>Implement the solution numerically.</li>
<li>Execute the solution.</li>
<li>Report and comment upon the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>To complete the first step, I’ll read through the assignment and list the following things. Since this reactor has both a jacket and a coil, I’ll use a subscripted “ex” to denote quantities related to the jacket and “coil” to denote quantities related to the coil. The operating protocol for this reactor has two stages, a heating stage and a cooling stage. I’ll use a subscripted “0” to denote values of quantities at the start of the heating stage, a subscripted “1” to denote quantities at end of the heating stage (which is also the start of the cooling stage), and a subscripted “f” to denote quantities at the end of the cooling stage (which is also the end of the process).</p>

<p>The operational protocol for this reactor has two stages. I need to write and simplify the reactor design equations needed to model each stage of the operation of this system. The reactor is the same in the heating and cooling stages, so the same reactor design equation apply to both stages, but some of the terms in the equations change between the first and second stage of operation.</p>
<p>The reactor design equations always include at least one mole balance. The general BSTR mole balance is given in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_mole_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.8</span></a>. I’ll write a mole balance for both of the reagents in this system, noting that the sum reduces to a single term since only one reaction is taking place.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \cancelto{\nu_{i,1}r_1}{\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j}
\]</span></p>
<p>The BSTR is not isothermal, so I must include an energy balance on the reacting fluid among the design equations. The general BSTR mole balance is given in <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_energy_balance">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.9</span></a>. Assuming the liquid to be incompressible and the reactor walls to be rigid, both the pressure and volume will be constant, so their time-derivatives will equal zero. The work associated with mixing the reactor can also be assumed to be negligible. There is only one reaction occurring, so the final sum will reduce to a single term. In addition, the assignment provides the volumetric heat capacity of the entire solution, so the sensible heat term can be written in terms of that heat capacity, <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-bstr_equivalent_sens_heat_terms">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.10</span></a>. During the first stage of the operating protocol, heat is exchanged with both the cooling water and the steam, so the rate of heat exchange must be split into two terms. During the second stage the coil is not present.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\cancelto{V \breve{C}_p}{\left(\sum_i n_i \hat C_{p,i} \right)} \frac{dT}{dt} - V\cancelto{0}{\frac{dP}{dt}}  - P  \cancelto{0}{\frac{dV}{dt}}  = \cancelto{\dot{Q}_{ex} + \dot{Q}_{coil}}{\dot Q} - \cancelto{0}{\dot W} - V \cancelto{r_1 \Delta H_1}{\sum_j \left(r_j \Delta H_j \right)}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V \breve{C}_p \frac{dT}{dt} = \dot{Q}_{ex} + \dot{Q}_{coil} - V r_1 \Delta H_1
\]</span></p>
<p>There are two heat exchange fluids in this system. The water in the jacket exchanges sensible heat so the energy balance on it is given by <a href="section_3_design_equations.html#eq-exchange_energy_bal_sensible">Equation&nbsp;<span>6.2</span></a>. During the first stage of the operating protocol, the coolant is not flowing, so <span class="math inline">\(\dot{m}_{ex} = 0\)</span>. Noting that the heat capacity is constant, the integral is easily evaluated.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\rho_{ex} V_{ex} \tilde C_{p,ex}\frac{dT_{ex}}{dt} = -\dot{Q}_{ex} - \dot m_{ex} \int_{T_{ex,in}}^{T_{ex}} \tilde C_{p,ex}dT
\]</span></p>
<p>The steam in the coil exchanges latent heat, so its temperature is known and constant. As a consequence, the mole balances, energy balance on the reacting fluid and energy balance on the cooling water can be solved independently of the energy balance on the steam. The problem does not ask any questions about the steam flow rate or how much of it condenses, so an energy balance on the steam is not needed.</p>
<p>Momentum balances are not used for stirred tank reactors, so the full set of reactor design equations consists of mole balances on A and Z, an energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the cooling water.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Reactor Design Equations</strong></p>
<p>Mole balances on A and Z, equations (3) and (4) are the same in heating stage of the protocol and in the cooling stage. An energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the coolant in the shell during the heating stage are shown in equations (5) and (6). During the cooling stage of the operating protocol, an energy balance on the reacting fluid and an energy balance on the coolant take the forms shown in equations (7) and (8).</p>

<p><strong>Summary and Comments</strong></p>
<p>The optimum coolant flow rate is 183 g/min. At that coolant flow rate, the net rate of production of Z is 0.063 mol/min. The conversion of A and reacting fluid temperature during processing at the optimum coolant flow rate are shown in Figures <a href="#fig-example_13_4_conversion_profile"><span>13.8</span></a> and <a href="#fig-example_13_4_temperature_profile"><span>13.9</span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-example_13_4_net_rate_plot">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.7</span></a> shows that the rate effectively zero when the reactant is charged to the BSTR. <a href="#fig-example_13_4_temperature_profile">Figure&nbsp;<span>13.9</span></a> shows the steam heating increases the temperature to 50 °C in ca. 2.5 min, at which time the rate has become significant. The temperature continues to rise because heat is being released by reaction faster than it is being removed by the coolant. As the reactant is depleted, the rate does not increase as rapidly until eventually, after ca. 31.1 min, the rate reaches its maximum value. As the rate decreases, the amount of heat released due to reaction decreases until, at ca. 31.5 min, it becomes equal to the rate at which the coolant is removing heat. At that point the temperature passes through a maximum. After that the coolant removes heat faster than it is generated, and after ca. 100 min the temperature reaches 25 °C and processing ends. The conversion at this point is over 99%.</p>

<p>In this example, the net rate of reaction was maximized with respect to the cooling water flow rate. It might be possible to improve the process further by adjusting both the cooling water flow rate <em>and</em> the temperature where the heating coil is removed. If that were done, the graphical approach used here to maximize the net rate would not be the best mathematical approach. Instead, a reaction engineer might use software designed for multivariable optimization.</p>
