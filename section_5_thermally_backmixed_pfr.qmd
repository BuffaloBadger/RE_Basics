# Thermally Back-Mixed PFRs {#sec-5_thermal_backmix_pfr}

In a PFR the composition and temperature vary continuous from the inlet to the outlet. When an exothermic reaction is taking place in an adiabatic PFR, the temperature equals the feed temperature at the inlet and continuously increases until it reaches the outlet temperature at the end of the reactor. In a thermally backmixed PFR, some of the heat released by the reaction is transferred to the feed before it enters the reactor. This is beneficial because the rate of most reactions increases with temperature.

## Thermally Backmixed PFRs

When a typical exothermic reaction takes place in an adiabatic reactor, either a CSTR or a PFR, two competing effects are present. As the reaction proceeds, the temperature increases (a favorable effect, tending to increase the reaction rate) and the reactant concentration decreases (an unfavorable effect, tending to decrease the reaction rate). In many cases, the temperature effect predominates at lower conversions and the reactant concentration effect predominates at higher conversions. In a PFR, the reactant concentration decreases gradually (favorable behavior since it tends to keep the rate as high as possible), but the temperature also increases gradually (unfavorable behavior since the rate coefficient increases gradually). In a CSTR, the reactant concentration is low for the entire time the fluid reacts (unfavorable behavior since it tends to make the rate low), but the temperature is at its highest value throughout the time the fluid reacts (favorable behavior since it tends to make the rate high). Thus, neither a single CSTR nor a single PFR is ideally suited to an exothermic reaction.

In @sec-5_reactor_networks, it was shown that using a cascade of CSTRs makes the CSTRs behave a little more like a PFR. Here, it will be seen that by augmenting a PFR with a heat exchanger, it is sometimes possible to impart CSTR-like thermal behavior to a PFR while retaining PFR-like behavior with respect to the composition. To see how this can be accomplished, examine @fig-thermally_backmixed_pfr which shows a heat exchanger connected to a PFR. There are two compartments in the heat exchange; the feed flows through one compartment and the product stream from the PFR flows through the other. The two compartments are physically separated by a wall (red), so there is no mass exchanged between the streams. However, it is possible for heat to be conducted through the (red) wall. In this way, as the feed flows through the lower compartment of the heat exchanger, heat is transferred to it from the PFR product stream flowing through the upper compartment. This is similar to what happens thermally in a CSTR where the complete back-mixing (mixing product into the feed) of the CSTR immediately heats the feed to the final outlet temperature. Due to the heat exchanger in @fig-thermally_backmixed_pfr, the PFR inlet temperature is higher and consequently, the rate at the PFR inlet is larger than it would be without the heat exchanger.

When a thermally backmixed PFR is used, it is sometimes possible for an exothermic reaction to occur auto-thermally. That is, with the heat exchanger the reaction can reach a high steady state conversion without the need to continually supply heat. In contrast, the steady state conversion could be much, much lower without the heat exchanger. In particular, consider a situation where the feed, stream 0, is supplied at a temperature where the rate of reaction is very small. If this feed is admitted directly to the reactor, without a heat exchanger, very little reaction will occur and consequently very little heat of reaction will be released. As a result, the temperature will not rise significantly, and so the rate will remain small through the entire reactor. If the same feed is used, but it first passes through a heat exchanger as in @fig-thermally_backmixed_pfr, the feed will enter the reactor at a higher temperature where the rate is high enough to cause some reaction to occur. That, in turn will release more heat so that the rate is appreciable throughout the reactor. Of course, as the reactant is depleted, the rate will eventually decrease. Nonetheless, for a typical exothermic reaction taking place adiabatically, a thermally backmixed PFR like that shown in Figure 30.1 offers the best features of both a CSTR and a PFR: the feed is immediately heated, as in a CSTR, while the reactant concentration starts high and decreases gradually, as in a PFR.

## Analysis of Thermally Backmixed PFRs

In order to analyze a thermally backmixed PFR, reactor design equations must be generated for the PFR and mole and energy balances must be written for the heat exchanger. Here only steady state operation will be considered. The reactor design equations for a steady-state PFR, Equations [-@eq-pfr_ss_mol_balance] and [-@] eq-pfr_ss_energy_balance, were derived in @sec-apndx_ideal_reactor_models and discussed in @sec-4_pfr_analysis. Recall that these equations also can be written using the reactor volume as the dependent variable, and the sensible heat term can be written in terms of the volumetric or gravimetric heat capacity of the reacting fluid as a whole.

$$
\frac{d \dot{n}_i}{d z}  =\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j \nu_{i,j}r_j
$$

$$
\left(\sum_i \dot{n}_i \hat{C}_{p,i} \right) \frac{d T}{d z} = \pi D U\left( T_{ex} - T  \right) - \frac{\pi D^2}{4}\sum_j r_j \Delta H_j
$$

The mole and energy balance equations for a counter-current heat exchanger like that depicted in @fig-thermally_backmixed_pfr, Equations [-@eq-heat_exchanger_mol_bal_1], [-@eq-heat_exchanger_mol_bal_2], and [-@eq-heat_exchanger_energy_bal], were presented in @sec-5_reactor_networks. In terms of @fig-thermally_backmixed_pfr, stream h1 in those equations is the stream that enters the heat exchanger as stream 0 and leaves as stream 1 and stream h2 enters the heat exchanger  as stream 2 and leaves as stream 3. @sec-5_reactor_networks also showed versions of @eq-heat_exchanger_energy_bal that used the volumetric and gravimetric heat capacity of the fluid.

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{i,h1,in} - \dot{n}_{i,h1,out}
$$

$$
0 = \dot{n}_{i,h2,in} - \dot{n}_{i,h2,out}
$$

$$
0 = \sum_i \left( \dot{n}_{i,h1,in} \int_{T_{h1,in}}^{T_{h1,out}}\hat{C}_{p,i} dT\right) + \sum_i \left( \dot{n}_{i,h2,in} \int_{T_{h2,in}}^{T_{h2,out}} \hat{C}_{p,i} dT\right)
$$

It was also noted in @sec-5_reactor_networks that when only two of the four stream temperaturs are known, an additional equation is needed. Often the expression for the rate of heat transfer through the wall of the heat exchanger, @eq-sensible_heat_area, is used. Alternatively, when analyzing a thermally backmixed PFR the cold approach, @eq-cold_approach, is sometimes specified instead. In @eq-cold_approach, stream hx can be either of the two streams flowing through the reactor.

$$
\dot{Q}_{hx} = UA\left( \frac{\left(T_{h_1,in} - T_{h_2,out}\right) - \left( T_{h_1,out} - T_{h_2,in} \right)}{\ln{\displaystyle\frac{T_{h_1,in} - T_{h_2,out}}{T_{h_1,out} - T_{h_2,in} }}} \right)
$$

$$
\Delta T_{cold} = T_3 - T_0
$$ {#eq-cold_approach}

A key point associated with the heat exchanger are that the two fluid streams do not mix. It should also be noted that the equations presented here are for a counter-current flow and for a heat transfer coefficient based on the log-mean temperature difference in the heat exchanger. Many other styles of heat exchanger might be used, in which case a good reference on heat transfer should be consulted. The focus here is on the reactor and reaction, not the details of the heat exchanger.

### Solving the Thermally Backmixed PFR Design Equations


Most commonly with a system like that shown in @fig-thermally_backmixed_pfr, the composition of stream 0 is known, and consequently, the composition of stream 1 is also known. One of the four temperatures will also be known (commonly $T_0$). In many cases, it wonâ€™t be possible to solve the PFR design equations independently because $T_1$ will not be known. In that situation, the reactor design equations for the PFR and the mole and energy balances for the heat exchanger must be solved simultaneously. The PFR design equations are IVODEs while the heat exchanger balance equations are ATEs. Together the reactor and heat exchanger balances constitute a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). @sec-apndx_solve_daes describes the numerical solution of DAEs of this form.

## Examples

This chapter presents two examples of the analysis of a thermally backmixed PFR. The first example illustrates an assignment where the conversion is specified and the reactor volume must be determined while in the second example the reactor volume is known and the final composition must be determined. The second example also illustrates a heat exchanger where the heat transfer coefficient based on the arithmetic mean temperature difference is known.
