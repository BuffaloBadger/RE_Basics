# Notation and Sign Conventions {#sec-notation}

The last section of each chapter and appendix in *Reaction Engineering Basics* lists the symbols and their meaning as used in that chapter or appendix. This appendix describes notation that is used throughout the book. It also lists the sign convention associated with some quantities.

## Notation

**Dots over variable symbols** are used in *Reaction Engineering Basics* to designate flow variables.

* $n_i$ represents the moles of $i$ whereas $\dot n_i$ represents the molar flow rate of $i$.
* $W$ represents work (energy) whereas $\dot W$ represents the rate of doing work (power).

**A vertical bar with a subscript** is used in *Reaction Engineering Basics* to specify the conditions at which a quantity is evaluated.

* $\Delta H_j^0 \Bigr\rvert_{T=\text{300 K}}$ represents the standard enthalpy change for reaction $j$ *evaluated at* 300 K.
* $n_A \Bigr\rvert_{t=0}$ represents the moles of A *at* $t=0$.

**A summation or continuous product with a single index** indicates that the sum or product should include *all* possible values of the indexed quantity. For example, in *Reaction Engineering Basics*, $i\text{-}r$ denotes a fluid phase reactant in the reaction of interest and $i\text{-}p$ denotes a product. In the following equation the reaction of interest is mechanistic step $j\text{-}m$, so the first continuous product should include *all* of the reactants in that reaction and the second continuous product should include *all* of the products.

$$
r_{j\text{-}m} = k_{j\text{-}m,f} \prod_{i\text{-}r}\left[ i\text{-}r \right]^{-\nu_{i\text{-}r,j\text{-}m}} - k_{j\text{-}m,r}\prod_{i\text{-}p}\left[ i\text{-}p \right]^{\nu_{i\text{-}p,j\text{-}m}}
$$

## Sign Conventions

* Stoichiometric coefficients of reactants are **negative**.
* Stoichiometric coefficients of products are **positive**.
* If a reagent is neither a reactant nor a product in a given reaction , its stoichiometric coefficient in that reaction is **zero**.
* Heat *added to* a system is **positive**.
* Work *done by* a system is **positive**.
