# Generation and Analysis of Kinetics Data {#sec-6_kin_data_gen}

If the rate of a reaction has been studied previously, an expression for the rate of that reaction may be available. When a rate expression is [not]{.underline} available, it is necessary to develop one. In this situation, the mathematical form of the rate expression is not known. Whatever rate expression is eventually developed will contain kinetics parameters that also are unknown. Kinetics data are needed to develop a rate expression because theory alone cannot provide the mathematical form of the rate expression nor the values of the kinetics parameters that appear in it.

Reaction rates depend upon temperature, pressure and composition. Temperature can be measured using thermometers or thermocouples. Pressure can be measured using manometers or a wide variety of pressure gauges. Fluid composition can be measured using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry or many other instruments. The same is not true for reaction rates. There isn't a meter, gauge, or instrument that one can put in or attach to a chemical reactor to directly measure the rate of the reaction or reactions going on within it. 

Since rates cannot be measured directly, changes in composition (or something related to composition) that occur in chemical reactors are measured instead. Those changes are measured experimentally at different reactor temperatures, pressures and compositions, resulting in a set of experimental kinetics data. Three different approaches can be used to analyze those data and develop a rate expression. This brief chapter considers the design of kinetics experiments and presents an overview of the three approaches that can be used to analyze the data generated in those experiments. Before doing so, it is useful to recall the process used to develop rate expressions that was described in @sec-2_rates_rate_express.

## Procedure for Developing a Rate Expression

The following sequence of events is representative of the process for development of a rate expression for a reaction.

1. A preliminary analysis, perhaps including a few preliminary experiments, is performed to establish the range of conditions (temperature, pressure and composition) over which the rate expression will be used.
2. A laboratory reactor is selected to be used to generate kinetics data.
3. A set of kinetics experiments using that reactor is specified, and the experiments are performed to generate a kinetics data set.
4. A mathematical form is proposed for the rate expression.
5. The values of all unknown parameters appearing in the proposed rate expression are estimated using the experimental data set.
6. The accuracy of the proposed rate expression is assessed.
7. One of the following decisions is made.
    a. Accept the rate expression.
    b. Perform additional experiments and reassess the proposed rate expression using steps 5 through 7.
    c. Reject the proposed rate expression, propose another rate expression with a different mathematical form, and assess the new rate expression using steps 5 through 7.

The identification of the reaction and the preliminary analysis (step 1) can be driven by a variety of factors including a perceived business opportunity, regulatory mandates, etc. The selection of a reactor to use in kinetics experiments (step 2) is briefly considered in Chapters [-@sec-6_bstr_data_analysis], [-@sec-6_cstr_data_analysis], and [-@sec-6_pfr_data_analysis]. Chapters [-@sec-2_rates_rate_express] and [-@sec-2_mechanisms] described how a mathematical form of the rate expression can be postulated empirically, theoretically or mechanistically. The remainder of this chapter presents a general overview of the design of kinetics experiments (step 3), parameter estimation (step 5), accuracy assessment (step 6), and deciding whether to accept the rate expression (step 7).

## Design of Kinetics Experiments

The preliminary analysis establishes a range of temperature, pressure and composition that is suitable and appropriate for running the reaction. The purpose of kinetics experiments is to generate experimental data that span that range of temperature, pressure and composition with sufficient resolution to capture how temperature, pressure, and composition affect the rate.

The nature of kinetics experiments is relatively straightforward. In each experiment a group of reactor inputs are adjusted to pre-determined values. Those adjusted input variables are referred to as *factors* when discussing the design of experiments. The person performing the experiment then measures one output from the reactor. That output can be referred to as the measured response. (The experimenter could measure several different responses. *Reaction Engineering Basics only considers the analysis of data where a single response was measured.) Thus the data from one experiment consist of the values of the factors (adjusted input variables) and the corresponding measured response. Performing many experiments then results in a kinetics data set. A kinetics data set can be thought of as a table where there is a column for each factor and a column for the measured response, and each row contains the values of those quantities for one of the experiments that was performed.

The data set could be generated by randomly changing the factors from one experiment to the next. A better approach, though, is to design the experiments. The first step in designing kinetics experiments is to **decide which reactor inputs to use as factors**. The factors should be chosen so that the resulting kinetics data set will span the desired range of temperature, pressure and composition.

The first factor to consider is the temperature. Kinetics data are typically generated using small, laboratory-scale reactors. Through the use of a temperature controller, it is usually possible to design the experimental reactor so that it will operate isothermally at a temperature chosen by the reactor operator. A temperature controller is a device that continually monitors the temperature of the reacting fluid and adjusts the amount of heating or cooling provided to the reactor so that the temperature remains constant at the chosen value.

Typically reaction rates are much more sensitive to temperature than to pressure and composition. The Arrhenius expression indicates an exponential dependence of the rate upon inverse temperature. This is much stronger than the composition dependence found in most rate expressions. Consequently, if composition and temperature are varied simultaneously, the strong temperature effect may mask weaker composition effects. This has two consequences related to kinetics experiments.

First, if at all possible, the reactor should operate isothermally during each individual kinetics experiment. If the temperature varys, it becomes necessary to account for the variation when the data are analyzed. This can make the data analysis much more difficult, and if the temperature variation is not accurately accounted for in the analysis, the strong temperature effects may result in an inaccurate rate expression. Operating the reactor isothermally eliminates that difficulty.

Secondly, assuming that the reactor operates isothermally in each experiment, it is preferrable to use "blocks" of isothermal experiments where all of the experiments in each block are run at the same temperature and each block uses a different temperature. Then within any one block only the pressure and composition are varying and their effects are more easily ascertained because the stronger effect of temperature is absent.

Returning to the selection of which reactor inputs to use as factors, the second factor to consider is the pressure. For liquid-phase reactions the pressure often does not affect the rate and does not need to be adjusted. For gas phase reactions it usually is straightforward to adjust the system pressure from experiment to experiment. For isothermal gas-phase reactions, setting the pressure sets the total molar concentration, as can be seen from the ideal gas law, @eq-pressure_concentration_ideal_gas. 

$$
C_{\text{total}} = \frac{n_{\text{total}}}{V} = \frac{P}{RT}
$${#eq-pressure_concentration_ideal_gas}

The most common composition variables appearing in rate expressions are concentrations and, for gases, partial pressures. For gases, the concentration of a reagent is equal to its mole fraction times the total concentrateion, and the partial pressure of a reagent is equal to its mole fraction times the total pressure.

A number of different reactor inputs can be used to adjust the composition of the reacting fluid. For example, in a BSTR experiment the composition can be altered by changing the initial molar amount of one or more reagents and by changing the reaction time. In a flow reactor the composition can be altered by changing the inlet flow rates of each reagent, inlet concentrations and total flow rate. It is important to vary the amounts of reactants *and products* when performing kinetics experiments.

Once a set of factors has been identified, that is, once it has been decided which reactor inputs will be adjusted from experiment to experiment, it is necessary to **identify the response that will be measured in the experiments**. The response should be some easily measurable quantity that is related to the change in the composition of the reacting fluid from the start of the experiment to the point when/where it was measured. There are many possibilities including the outlet or final concentration of a reagent, the conversion of a reactant, an outlet or final mole fraction of a reagent, etc.

The response can also be a property that is related to the concentration of a reagent or the overall composition. For example, if one reagent absorbs radiation of a specific frequency, the transmission of radiation of that frequency through a fixed distance can be related to the reagent's concentration. Similarly, the refactive index of a liquid mixture may be related to its composition.

Once the response and the adjusted inputs have been chosen, **a set of "levels" must be chosen** for each of the factors (adjusted inputs). These are the values to which the factors will be adjusted during the experiments. For example, it might be decided to use four temperature levels of 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C. That means that a set of experiments will be conducted at 100 °C, another set at 110 °C, and so on. Things that must be considered when choosing the levels for each factor include the time that is available for doing the experiments and the cost of the experiments (purchase of reagents, salaries for technicians performing the experiments, etc.). Sometimes there can be a trade off between the resolution of the experimental data and the time/cost of the experiments. A design with more levels should capture the effect of changing a factor more fully, but it will require more experimental time and cost more. A design with fewer levels will reduce the experimental time required and cost less, but it may not fully capture the effects of changing temperature, pressure, and composition.

The kinetics experiments entail adjusting each of the inputs to one of its levels, measuring the corresponding response, adjusting one or more of the inputs to a different one of it levels, measuring the response, etc. The final aspect of experimental design is **deciding which combinations of levels to use to generate the kinetics data**. There are a few ways to do this. A common one, sometimes called a *full factorial design*, simply includes every possible combination of the input levels. [Example -@sec-example_18_6_1] illustrates full factorial design of a kinetics experiment.

## Parameter Estimation

Before their values can be estimated, the parameters appearing in a rate expression must be identified. The rate expressions considered in Chapters [-@sec-2_rates_rate_express] and [-@sec-2_mechanisms] feature a few different kinds of rate expression parameters. They include rate coefficients, equilibrium constants, and power-law reaction orders. Rate coefficients (or, as discussed below, the pre-expoential factors and activation energies in the Arrhenius expression for the rate coefficients) are always rate expression parameters.

Equilibrium constants are [not]{.underline} treated as rate expression paramters if appropriate thermodynamic data for calculating their values are available (free energy and heat of reactions, see @sec-apndx_reaction_thermo). However, in some instances, particularly when using mechanistic rate expressions, an equilibrium constant for a step in a reaction mechanism may appear in a rate expression. Under these circumstances, thermodynamic data for the equilibrium constant may not be available, and an Arrhenius-like expression, @eq-equil_like_arrhenius, can be written for it. In this situation, the equilibrium constant is treated in the same manner as described below for rate coefficients.

The experimental design described in the preceding section will lead to a data set where every experiment was performed at one of the chosen temperature levels. It is also possible to generate a data set that does not use specific temperature levels, but instead varies the temperature randomly. If specific temperature levels were not used, or if they were used, but for some reason, one wants to analyze the entire data set at once, then all rate coefficients (and equilibrium constants that cannot be calculated) must be written in terms of the pre-exponential factor and activation energy. For example, a simple rate expression where the reaction is first order in the concentration of reagent A must be written as shown in @eq-first_order_using_arrhenius. The parameters to be estimated in this situation are $k_0$ and $E$.

$$
r = k_0 \exp { \left( \frac{-E}{RT} \right) } C_A
$$ {#eq-first_order_using_arrhenius}

However, when the data are generated using a fixed number of temperature levels, as in the factorial design described above, it is preferrable to break the full data set into "blocks" such that all of the experiments at the first temperature level are included in one block. All of the experiments at the second temperature level are included in a second block, and so on. When the data are broken into same-temperature blocks like this, that rate expression should be written without using the Arrhenius expression, as shown in @eq-first_order_not_using_arrhenius. When the rate expression is written in this form, the only parameter to be estimated is $k$, but the data analysis must proceed in two stages.

$$
r = k C_A
$$ {#eq-first_order_not_using_arrhenius}

In the first stage, each data block is processed separately to estimate the value of $k$ at that block temperature. This yields a secondary $k$ *vs*. $T$ data set. In the second stage of analysis, the Arrhenius pre-exponential factor, $k_0$, and activation energy, $E$, are estimated using those data. This can be done using linear least squares parameter estimation as described in @sec-apndx_parameter_est, and illustrated in Examples [-@sec-example_4_5_4] and [-@sec-example_L_7_1].

### Estimation of Rate Expression Parameters

Parameter estimation involves a process known as "fitting" a model to data. To estimate rate expression parameters a predicted response model is "fit" to the kinetics data. More specifically, a model that predicts the experimental responses is formulated using a model for the experimental reactor and the proposed rate expression. The predicted responses model then is fit to the experimental data. Just as special solver functions are used to solve ATEs and IVODEs numerically, special fitting functions are used to fit models to data.

There are many software packages that provide fitting functions. Recognizing that different readers of this book will prefer to use different software packages, @sec-apndx_parameter_est describes how such software works, the input it requires and the results it returns in general terms. Sufficient information is provided so that readers of this book can follow the examples and can implement solutions using the software they prefer. It is left to the reader to consult the software they choose to learn the details for using it.

@fig-param_est_info_flow illustrates the essence of using a fitting function to fit a reactor model to experimental data. Briefly, the fitting function is provided with the experimental factors (adjusted input variables) and measured responses for each of the experiments being used in the analysis, an initial guess for the parameters, and the name of a "responses function" that the user must write. In essence, the fitting function keeps guessing values for the parameters until it finds the parameter values for which the model-predicted responses are as close as possible to the experimentally measured responses (see @sec-apndx_parameter_est for more details). It then returns those parameter values along with statistical information that indicates how closely the experimental and predicted responses agree. Most *Reaction Engineering Basics* examples assume that the fitting function returns the 95% confidence intervals for each parameter and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, as the statistical indicators (again, see @sec-apndx_parameter_est for more details). Other statistical indicators such as standard errors can be used in place of these.

![Information flow for fitting a reactor model to an experimental data set using a computer fitting function.](Graphics/parameter_estimation_info_flow.png){#fig-param_est_info_flow width="70%"}

Internally, the fitting function needs to be able to calculate the responses predicted by the model each time it generates a new guess for the parameters. To enable it to do so, the user must write a computer function that will be referred to here as the **responses function**, and provide it to the fitting function. As indicated in @fig-param_est_info_flow, that function will be provided with guesses for the parameters and the factors for all of the experiments in the data set being analyzed. The responses function uses a reactor model that contains the rate expression being analyzed to calculate the predicted responses and return them to the fitting function.

### Reactor Models Used in Responses Functions

Personal computers now are ubiquitous, and a variety of mathematics software packages with fitting functions are available. As such, it is relatively easy and straightforward to solve the reactor model equations numerically within the responses function. Doing so is virtually always possible, and the reactor models are the same as those used everywhere else in this book. This approach is used in most of the examples in *Reaction Engineering Basics* because it can always be used and it does not introduce any inaccuracies. The downsides are that it requires writing computer code and making an initial guess for the parameter values.

Historically, i. e. when the author was a student, computers were not readily available and both solving the reactor model equations and fitting the model to experimental data had to be performed analytically using a calculator or even a slide rule. A common practice then was to either linearize the reactor model or to use an approximate reactor model to keep the calculations from being overwhelming.

**Using a Linearized Reactor Model**

It is sometimes possible to linearize the reactor model and then use linear least squares for parameter estimation. As described in @sec-3_design_eqns and shown in [Example -@sec-example_6_8_1], when a single reaction takes place in an isothermal reactor, the composition of the reacting fluid can be modeled using a single mole balance on any one reactant or product. To use this approach to parameter estimation, a single mole balance on one of the reactants or products *must be used* to model the reactor. Additionally, if the mole balance is an initial value ordinary differential equation (IVODE), it must be solved analytically to obtain an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE). For steady-state CSTRs, the reactor model will already be an ATE.

The ATE model then must be rearranged so that by defining new variables (based on the experimental variables) and new parameters (based on the rate expression parameters), it becomes a linear equation like that shown in @eq-linear_equation, where $y$ and the $x_i$ represent the new variables and $m_i$ and $b$ represent the new parameters. The rate expression parameters [can not]{.underline} appear in the defining equations for the new variables, and the new parameters must be constants that do not vary when any of the experimental variables change. Additionally, a *unique* combination of the rate expression parameters must appear in the defining equation for each slope, $m_i$, and the intercept, $b$. That means that if there is only one rate expression parameter, the linearized reactor model is of the form, $y=mx$, and if there are two rate expression parameters the linearized reactor model has the form $y=mx+b$. Generally, when there are $n+1$ rate expression parameters, the form will be as shown in @eq-linear_equation.

$$
y = m_1x_1 + m_2x_2 + \cdots + m_nx_n + b
$$ {#eq-linear_equation}

The experimental factors (adjusted input variables) and the measured responses are used to calculate the values of the new variables, $y$ and $x_1$ through $x_n$, for each experiment. @eq-linear_equation is then fit to the new variables using linear least-squares. The fitting can be performed analytically using formulae for the best estimates for the intercept and slope. More commonly, a spreadsheet program is used to estimate the linearized model parameters, $m_i$ and $b$. If the linearized reactor model has the form $y=mx$ or $y=mx+b$, a spreadsheet also can be used to create a model plot where the experimental $y$ *vs*. $x$ data are plotted as points and the fitted $y$ *vs*. $x$ model is plotted as a line.

The linearized model parameters were defined in terms of the rate expression parameters during the linearization process. After using linear least squares to estimate the best values for the slopes, $m_i$, and intercept, $b$, those defining equations finally are used to calculate the best values of the rate expression parameters.

Importantly, it is *not always possible* to analytically solve mole balances that are IVODEs and it is *not always possible* to linearize an ATE model equation. As such, **this approach cannot always be used**. When it can be used, it offers the advantages of using a spreadsheet to analyze the data instead of writing code and it does not require a guess for the values of the rate expression parameters. The disadvantages are that it requires analytical solution of the reactor design equations for BSTRs and PFRs, and it involves algebraic manipulation of the ATE to put it in a linear form.

**Using an Approximate Reactor Model (Differential Analysis)**

The third approach to the analysis of a block of experimental kinetics data can only be used when the data are from a BSTR or PFR. The mole balances for a BSTR or a steady-state PFR are IVODEs. In this approach, a single mole balance on one of the reactants or products again is used. In contrast to the other approaches, that IVODE is *not* solved directly. Instead, the value of the derivative is approximated, for example using finite differences (see [Appendix -@sec-apndx_pre_knowledge]). The resulting approximate mole balance is an algebraic-transcendental equation (ATE) that typically is then linearized and fit to the experimental data as described above. This approach is also referred to as differential data analysis.

There isn't any real advantage to this approach today, because it is easy to solve the IVODE form of the mole balance numerically using a computer. While approximating the derivative makes the analysis more tractable, it is not as accurate as solving the IVODE form of the mole balance. Today, differential analysis is sometimes used for a quick, preliminary analysis of kinetics data, but **the other approaches described in this section are preferred**.

### Estimation of the Arrhenius Expression Parameters

As described above, if the experimental data consist of blocks of same-temperature data, parameter estimation can be applied to each block separately. Doing so yields $k$ *vs*. $T$ data for each rate coefficient and $K$ *vs*. $T$ data for each equilibrium constant where the free energy and heat of raction are unknown. Both $k$ and $K$ are expected to exhibit Arrhenius-like temperature dependence, @eq-arrhenius and @eq-equil_like_arrhenius.

$$
k_j = k_{0,j} \exp{\left(  \frac{-E_j}{RT} \right)} \qquad \qquad \qquad K_j = K_{0,j}\exp{\frac{-\Delta H_j^0}{RT}}
$$

Each of those equations can be linearized by taking the logarithm of each side of the equation. 

$$
\ln{k_j} = E_j \left( \frac{-1}{RT} \right) + \ln{k_{0,j}} \qquad \qquad \qquad \ln{K_j} = \Delta H_j^0 \left( \frac{-1}{RT} \right) + \ln{K_{0,j}}
$$

Then, letting $y$ equal either $\ln{k_j}$ or $\ln{K_j}$ and letting $x$ = $\frac{-1}{RT}$, linear least squares can be used to find $k_{0,j}$ and $E_j$ or $K_{0,j}$ and $\Delta H^0_j$, as described in @sec-apndx_parameter_est and illustrated in Examples [-@sec-example_4_5_4] and [-@sec-example_L_7_1].

### Estimation of Other Temperature-Dependent Parameters

Modeling the temperature dependence of other types of rate expression parameters such as the exponents in a power-law rate expression is more difficult. Power-law rate expressions are empirical, so there isn't any theory that predicts how power-law exponents should vary with temperature. Plotting them *versus* temperature may show that they can be treated as constant, or it may suggest some functional form such as linear or exponential.

If an expression for the temperature dependence of empirical rate expression parameters like these cannot be developed, one option is to leave them in tabular form and interpolate to find values at temperatures other than the levels studied in the kinetics experiments. This greatly reduces the utility of the rate expression for reaction engineering purposes.

The other option is to combine all of the same-temperature data blocks into a single kinetics data set. If this is done, all rate coefficients and equilibrium constants with unknown thermodynamic date must be written in terms of pre-exponential factors and activation energies or heats of reaction. The power-law exponents can the be left as constants that do not depend on temperature. If this approach is used, a single rate expression will be obtained, but it likely will not be as accurate as the rate expressions obtained by separate analysis of same-temperature data blocks.

## Accuracy Assessment {#sec-accuracy_assessment}

Accuracy must be assessed each time parameter estimation is performed. That is, accuracy should be assessed after the estimation of the rate expression parameters at each temperature. It should also be assessed after estimation of pre-exponential factors and activation energies (or heats of reaction). For the proposed rate expression to be accepted, the accuracy should be high in *all* assessments.

All of the approaches described above for performing parameter estimation can also be made to yield additional statistics that are useful for assessing the accuracy of the resulting rate expression. These include some measure of the uncertainty in each of the estimated parameters (typically the standard error or a 95% confidence interval) and the coefficient of determination, $R^2$. The following criteria indicate an accurate rate expression.

* The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, is close to 1.0.
* The uncertainty in each parameter is small relative to its value.
    * The standard error for the parameter is small relative to its value.
    * The upper and lower extremes of the 95% confidence interval for the parameter are close to the estimated value of the parameter.

The uncertainty in *most*, but not *all*, of the parameters might be small. This could indicate one of three possibilities. First, the factor levels used in the experiments may not allow accurate resolution of the parameters with high uncertainty. Second, the parameters with higher uncertainty may be mathematically coupled to other parameters (e. g. the rate may only depend on the product of two parameters so that the individual parameters can have any values as long as their product has the optimum value). Alternatively, the parameters with high uncertainty may not be needed, and there may be a simpler rate expression that is equally accurate with fewer parameters.

Graphical assessment of model accuracy is also possible. For **linear models with two parameters**, this was discussed in @sec-2_rates_rate_express and illustrated in Examples [-@sec-example_4_5_4] and [-@sec-example_L_7_1]. Spreadsheet programs can perform the parameter estimation and generate a **model plot** as described above. If the rate expression is accurate, the experimental data in the model plot will scatter randomly about the trendline. The deviations from the line will be small and there will not be any systematic deviations about the trendline.

With non-linear models and linear models with two or more $x$ variables, the resulting parameters can be used to calculate the model-predicted response for each experimental data point. A **parity plot** of the experimental responses *vs*. the model-predicted responses can be constructed. Additionally, the difference between each experimental response and the corresponding model-predicted response, i. e. the residuals, can be calculated and plotted against each of the adjusted input variables to get **a set of residuals plots**. In graphical assessment using these plots, the following criteria suggest that the model is accurate.

* The points in the parity plot are all close to a diagonal line ($y_{\text{expt}} = y_{\text{model}}$).
* In each residuals plot, the points scatter randomly about zero (the horizontal axis), and no systematic deviations are apparent.

## Deciding Whether to Accept the Proposed Rate Expression

The final step in kinetics data analysis involves **making a decision** to accept, reassess with additional data, or reject the proposed rate expression. In the end, this is a judgement call. This becomes easier as a reaction engineer gains experience.  The intended use of the rate expression, and more importantly the potential consequences of accepting an inaccurate rate expression, should be given serious consideration when making this decision. That is, if accepting an inaccurate rate expression might result in severe personal injury, significant property damage or catastrophic financial loss, the rate expression should be very, very accurate if it is accepted. If the consequences of accepting an inaccurate rate expression are less severe, somewhat lower accuracy may be deemed acceptable.

## Example

This chapter described the generation and analysis of kinetics data. The analysis of kinetics data was described in general terms. That information will be applied to the analysis of data from BSTRs, CSTRs and PFRs in the next three chapters, so no examples are included here. The example presented here illustrates the design of kinetics experiments for the purpose of generating kinetics data.

## Click Here to See What an Expert Might be Thinking at this Point

I am asked to design kinetics experiments, so I need to decide which variables will be adjusted in the experiments. I further need to decide how many levels to use for each adjusted variable and what those levels should be. The problem states that the rate expression developed using these data will be used to design a new process, so I want to be sure to generate a sizeable data set that spans the expected ranges of the adjusted variables and also captures the effects of each of them upon the response. Based upon the information presented in the problem statement, the experimental response here will be the concentration of A.

Reaction rates can be affected by the temperature and the concentration of each reagent present. Here the problem states that the rate is not affected by the concentration of Z, so the temperature and the concentration of A should vary from one experiment to the next. The reactor is isothermal, so the temperature can be adjusted directly in the experiments. The concentration of A will change as the reaction proceeds. This suggests two ways to vary the concentration of A from experiment to experiment. The first is to adjust the initial concentration of A and the second is to adjust the time at which the response is measured. Longer times will lead to smaller concentrations of A because at longer times more of the A will have reacted. I will use both the initial concentration of A and the reaction time as adjusted variables.

Next I need to decide how many levels to use for each adjusted variable and what those levels should be. Normally I would use levels that span a slightly wider range than the range where the rate expression will be used. Here, however, I'm told that the rate is too low below 65 °C and undesirable reactions occur above 90 °C, so I will choose levels that just span that range. The range only spans 25 °C, so four temperature levels seem reasonable, as does spacing them equally across the range.

I want to span a range of concentrations that is slightly wider than the expected range where the rate expression will be used. Three initial concentration levels of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 M will do so. Then, in order to ensure that the data are sensitive to the effect of the concentration of A, I will use six levels of reaction time. Noting that at 80 °C it takes 30 min for the reaction to go to completion, spacing the reaction times 5 minutes apart will lead to samples that span a wide range of conversions, and hence a wide range of concentrations of reagent A.

:::

**Experimental Design**

Three reactor inputs will be adjusted in the experiments: the temperature, $T$, the initial concentration of A, $C_{A,0}$, and the reaction time, $t$. The temperature levels will be 65, 73, 82, and 90 °C; the initial concentration levels will be 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 M; the reaction time levels will be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min. All possible combinations of these levels will be studied giving a total of 72 experimental data points.

It will not be necessary to perform 72 experiments, however. Using a reactor at 65 °C with an initial concentration of A equal to 0.5 M, six responses can be recorded in the experiment (at reaction times of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min). The number of experiments needed to record all 72 responses is 12. The initial conditions for those 12 experiments are shown in @tbl-example_18_6_1. Each experiment in the table will yield responses at all six reaction time levels.

| Experiment | T (°C) | C~A,0~ (M) |
|:------:|:-------:|:----------:|
| 1 | 65 | 0.5 |
| 2 | 65 | 1.0 |

## Note

Some readers might have difficulty with this problem because it relies upon an understanding of how BSTR kinetics experiments are performed and the data they generate, and that information has not been presented yet. BSTR kinetics experiments are considered in @sec-6_bstr_data_analysis. The important aspects of this example are that it was first necessary to decide which reactor model input variables to adjust, and then it was necessary to decide how many levels of each variable to use and what those levels should be. After doing that, the experimental design simply involves performing an experiment at every combination of the adjusted variable levels.
