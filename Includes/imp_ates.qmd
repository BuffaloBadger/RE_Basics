* Define a residual corresponding to each ATE if the residuals were not defined during mathematical formulation of the solution.
* Using mathematics software that includes an ATE solver,
    * make given and known constants available for use in all equations,
    * write a residuals function that calculates the values of the residuals given a guess for the unknowns,
    * define an initial guess for the unknowns,
    * call the ATE solver passing the residuals function and the initial guess to it and receiving a solution from it, and
    * check that the solver returned a converged solution.
* If additional solutions are possible, find them by repeating this process using different initial guesses.
