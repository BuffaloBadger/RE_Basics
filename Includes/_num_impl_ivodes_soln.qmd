1. Make the given and known constants available for use in all equations.
2. If the IVODEs contain an unknown constant, make the variable representing it available for use in all equations.
3. Define a derivatives function that 
    a. receives the independent and dependent variables as arguments,
    b. uses the ancillary equations to calculate all quantities appearing in the IVODEs, and
    c. calculates and returns the values of the derivatives.
4. Use the ancillary equations as needed to calculate and set the initial and final values.
5. Call an IVODE solver, passing the derivatives function, initial values and stopping criterion to it as arguments and receiving
    a. a set of values of the independent variable spanning the range from its initial value to its final value and 
    b. corresponding sets of values of each dependent variable. 
6. Process the results as necessary to complete the assignment.
