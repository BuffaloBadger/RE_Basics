1. Make given and known constants available for use in all equations.
2. Define a derivatives function that calculates the values of the derivatives given values of the independent and dependent variables.
3. Define the initial values of the independent and dependent variables.
4. Specify the stopping criterion.
5. Call the IVODE solver, passing the derivatives function, initial values and stopping criterion to it as arguments.
