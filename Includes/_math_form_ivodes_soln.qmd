* Write the design equations needed to model the reactor to be analyzed
* Add IVODEs or eliminate dependent variables until the number of IVODEs equals the number of dependent variables.
* Write the ancillary equations needed to calculate unknown constants and to eliminate any variables other than the independent variable and the dependent variables from the equations.
* Specify the initial value of the independent variable and the corresponding initial values of the dependent variables, and write ancillary equations to calculate them, if needed.
* Specify the stopping criterion, i. e. the final value of *either* the independent variable *or* one of the dependent variables, and write an ancillary equations to it, if needed.
* Solve the set of IVODEs to find the values of the independent and dependent variables within the range between their initial values and their final values.
