* Add IVODEs or eliminate dependent variables until the number of IVODEs, $N$, equals the number of dependent variables.
* Identify known constants, the independent variable, the $N$ dependent variables, and any other unknown variables appearing in the IVODEs.
* Express every unknown variable in terms of known constants, the independent variable, and the dependent variables.
* Specify the initial value of the independent variable and the corresponding initial values of the dependent variables.
* Specify the stopping criterion, i. e. the final value of *either* the independent variable *or* one of the dependent variables.
* Solve the set of $N$ IVODEs to find the values of the independent and dependent variables spanning the range from their initial values to their final values.
