1. Make given and known constants available for use in all equations.
2. Define a residual corresponding to each ATE and write a residuals function that calculates their values given a guess for the unknowns.
3. Define an initial guess for the unknowns.
4. Call an ATE solver passing to it, the function from step 2 and the initial guess from step 3.
5. Check that the solver returned a converged solution.
6. If additional solutions are possible, find them by repeating steps 3 through 6 with different initial guesses.
